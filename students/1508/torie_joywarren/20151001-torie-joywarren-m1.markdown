# Torie Joy-Warren - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission this module was to become more comfortable with coding and the
command line, and to work on implementing style and best practices. It was also
my mission to start becoming involved in the tech community (at Turing and in
Denver).

No absences.

### Work

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

In this ten day project, I implemented a data analyser for Colorado school data.
It was evaluated by Josh Cheek with the following results:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

Comments:
* "Some unused methods"
* "I like your test names"
* "Would get to 4 [on testing] if the test suite was fast enough that I could
  trivially say "yep, still works" as I changed things (ie less than 1 second)"
* "The classes have been refactored to depend on the parser as little as possible.
  This is really good, we're only 1 step away from getting rid of the parser
  altogether"


#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/night-writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this three day project, I implemented a writer for text to braille, and
reader for vice versa. It was evaluated by Jeff with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

Comments:
* "Watch out for variable naming -- don't include the data type"
* "Write methods to take in and return data rather than having side effects"
* "Really like the overall structure with Translator"
* "Look for opportunities to rip out small components"


#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/binary-search-tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

In this five day project, I implemented a binary search tree. It was evaluated
by Josh Cheek with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

Comments:
* "Prefer testing the interface over the details of the current implementation"
* "Really good test names (because they describe the behaviour of the tree)"
* Feature envy

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)

In this three day project, I implemented a linked list. It was evaluated by Sean
with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 4

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

In this four day project, I implemented three sorting algorithms: bubble sort,
insertion sort, and merge sort. It was evaluated by Josh Cheek with the
following results:

* Functional expectations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 4
* Organization: 4


Comments:
* "Tests a nice barrage of edge cases"
* "Pretty good naming ;)"
* "No style issues"
* "Mostly don't have to jump between levels of abstraction when thinking"

## Team

### Projects

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/http-yeah-you-know-me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this five day project, my partner (Matt Stjernholm) and I implemented a server that
connects to our night writer. It was evaluated by Josh Cheek with the following results:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3.5
* Code Sanitation: true
* Adoration Points: none
* Knowledge Retention: 10/10


## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Matt was great to work with, because he was a rare mix of very relaxed while
still caring a lot about the project. He didn't seem afraid to share ideas at all but also always listened to and (more importantly) considered any ideas I had, which made for a great working relationship. He's also just generally pleasant to be around - which has been much appreciated throughout the entire module."

"Pat has been incredibly helpful this module. He's always willing to spend large amounts of time working through problems with you, and has had a very positive influence on the cohort."

### Being a Community Member

“Torie has been a great classmate and teammate for the entirety of our first module.  She was always willing to lend  helping hand when I had questions on things that she’d already figured out, and she was always patient and thorough with her explanations.  I was lucky enough to have Torie as a partner for multiple pairing exercises and one team project.  Her positive attitude and kind demeanor were always fun to be around, and I learned a great deal from her each time we’ve paired.  I’ve seen her act in this capacity, not only for me, but for many others in 1508 -- we’re lucky to have her!"

"Torie is one of the most, if not the most impressive people in our cohort. She is a strong and quiet leader, and inspires us by the example she sets. Her combination of her aptitude, drive, curiosity and humility makes it hard to picture a ceiling for her potential. She's kind and considerate on top of all of this, which is perhaps most rare."

### Playing a Part

Turing events:
* Kids Who Code (Sep 12/2015)

Meetups:
* WWC technical interview skills (Sep 8/2015)
* WWC Ruby study group (Sep 16/2015)

## Review

### Notes

* Consistently strong projects.
* Felt the most meaningful learning experience was working with other people, and getting feedback.
* Headcount was valuable as a first large project as organization was important. 
* Don't let yourself off the hook to push yourself. 
* Work is consistently very good, want work to be consistently be phenomenal.



### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.


* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
