# John C. Slota - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

To obtain a proficiency in software development so that I can obtain a position in crypto currencies,
and to grow myself as a person on the journey through life.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed by Mike Dao on September 28th,

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3 -  Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
* Ruby Style: 3 - Developer writes code that is easy to follow
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3 - Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods
* Testing: 4 - Developer consistently takes small steps, using the tests for both design and verification
* Workflow: 3 - Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
* Collaboration: 4 - Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Attendance

I missed half a day due to my brother having a freak seizure accident where I went to pick him up from the hospital.

### Work  

#### (Headcount)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

Headcount was a project where we accessed data related to Colorado education and interpreted it,

Assessed by Tess

  Warned them about the bad habit of not breaking out classes into separate files
  Focused on the test harness once they realized that it was a thing. Their own tests suffered as a result

  * Overall Functionality: 3 - Completes the Data Access Layer
  * Enumerables: 2
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2 - Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant    refactoring
  * Test Driven Development: 2 - If I edit the code to be broken, then a test fails (in other words, the tests prove that the code is correct by failing when I add bugs to the code)
  * Breaking Logic into Components: 3 - Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities + 1 from influence point

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

Enigma was a project that had us recreate a device to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Our school is named after Alan Turing, the famed scientist who broke the German enigma machine
during World War 2. My partner was Marlo Major

Let them have the four on overall. Only issue was not following the runner specifications. Code could have been cleaned up. Could have done some refactoring, but fairly well split apart in general.

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### (Jungle_Beat)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle_Beat was a linkedlist project combined with making sounds.

Assessed by Andrew Carmer

Notes: * 25 tests * Does not write to files * many long methods * one class * many opportunities for refactoring for clarity

* Overall Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

### (Chisel)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/slotaj/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

Chisel was a project where we parsed a file from markdown into html.

Assessed by Mike Dao

Notes: * 25 tests * Does not write to files * many long methods * one class * many opportunities for refactoring for clarity

* Overall Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

### (SortingSuite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

Sorting Suite was our first projec, where we organized data based on a search pattern

Assessed by Josh Cheek

Notes: * 25 tests * Does not write to files * many long methods * one class * many opportunities for refactoring for clarity

* Overall Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 1
* Organization: 1

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I like to motivate people and give them positive feedback, I made sure to let Marlo my partner know that
he did a great job on our project. I also let my other partner know, Edgar, that he did some great work
when we finished pieces of our project together.

### Being a Community Member

John was easily one of the best people I’ve ever worked with. Early on, he let me know that he wouldn’t be here for the weekend and so we worked feverishly to finish the assignment long before the weekend. His forward thinking and responsible nature made him an absolute pleasure to work with. I would build almost any project with him again in a heartbeat. I’m excited to do so!

I enjoyed working with John, he is an ambitious and and energetic partner. Although we fell behind in the first weak, Johns
initiative helped us get on track to make a huge comeback when it seemed we would have nothing done.  -Edgar

### Playing a Part

I helped organize a crypto currency club that I'd like to continue as I go through Turing, we had several
Wednesday night meetings and even took a field trip to the Denver Bitcoin Center.

## Review

### Notes

* Take the weekend and get it up to a 3.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

Provisional

* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
 
## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
