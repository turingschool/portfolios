# (Jhun de Andres) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
Programming has always interested me. The idea that a person or a collective of people have built software that I use on a daily basis still baffles me. My goal was to hopefully build a viable foundation so that I too will be able to build something relevant and meaningful. Working in non profit work has really effected me and I've had the opportunity to work with some really amazing people. My mission this module was to begin building a foundation of information so that I could hopefully impart this information to some inner-city kids and hopefully pass on this amazing tool to them. It's slightly ambitious but I wanted to learn as much as I could.
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

### End of Module Assessment
FEEDBACK : I had to retake my module assessment and my passing one was with Jeff. Here are my scores.

SCORES:
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance
September 4th was a Friday. I left early because I had to drive to Iowa for my wedding reception. I notified Mike before I left.
(Summary of any missed time 1/2 day or more)

### Work
These are the projects I worked on throughout this module. I found that after each of my projects I started to progress in areas I struggled in.
(Intro)

#### (Mastermind)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/joshuajhun/mastermind)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown]

(Discription)
This was our first project. We had to build a terminal game that essentially allowed us to play a color guessing game against a computer. It's crazy to think I built this 5 weeks ago and to see how far I've come is really encouraging.

(Scores)
1. Fundamental Ruby and Style - 3
2. Enumerable & Collections - 2
3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality - 2
4. Breaking Logic into Components - 3


#### (Chisel)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/joshuajhun/chisel)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown]

(Description)
We were tasked to build a Markdown parser where we take in a markdown file and parse it into an HTML file. This was a project I wasn't too proud of. I essentially failed this one because I had to be in Iowa. I learned so much in that time though. I feel like after this project I really started to understand things.

(evaluation comments)
1.  Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
2.  Test-Driven Development: 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
3.  Functionality: 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations
4.  Breaking Logic into Components: 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of       responsibilities


#### (Jungle Beat)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/joshuajhun/junglebeat)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown]

(Description)
We were tasked with building a Linked List. This was the first project I feel like I really started to understand. As soon as I wrapped my mind around the concept of a Linked List I feel like I really started to understand things.

(Scores)
1.  Functional Expectations 2
2.  Test-Driven Development 2.5
3.  Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components 3
4.  Fundamental Ruby and Style 3
5.  Looping or Recursion 3

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Enigma)


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sekharp/enigma)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown]

(Discription)
This was our first group project. We had to encrypt a string based on a key and a date, decrypt that code, and then also crack the code given with the only known part of the list is "..end.."

(evaluation comments)
49 tests.
Some long methods, some opportunities for refactoring.
Tests could use some edge case testing, and additional unit tests.
Project complete, cracks in under a second.
All features work.
Constants could have been used more
Decrypt/Encrypt and portions of crack could be pulled out and combined to a single class.
File IO could be its own class.
Evaluated By: Mike

(Scores)
1. Overall Functionality 4
    Application follows the complete spec and can crack a 100-character message in under 1 second

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
    Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development 3
    Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components 4
    Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleHall/headcount)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown]

(description)
We had to parse some files and itterate through arrays of hashes and fetch the keys and values in methods.

(evaluation scores)
Overall Functionality
Score: 3

Completes some of the analysis layer
Using influence points from those nights in the trenches

Enumerables

Some nice enumerabling

Fundamental Ruby & Style
Score: 3

No style issues
Reasonable organization

Test-Driven Development
Score: 3

Those tests are hansome

Breaking Logic into Components

I can tell that it came from JSON b/c of things like the keys being strings when symbols and integers would make more sense

Code Sanitation
Score: 4

This is not a thing

(feedback to me)

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I love affirming people. I don't know if thats a real thing, but I want people to know that their hardwork doesn't go unseen. So I'll do my best to affirm and shout out people the most I can. The one thing I find encouraging is seeing my name in a shout-out email and people saying that they appreciate me for being myself.
(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

"Never in my life have I met someone as sincere, caring, and supportive as Jhun -  I knew that I was going to have to make this guy become my friend whatever it took!  However, over the course of the six weeks Jhun has been not only a friend, but also a confident, a shoulder to cry on, a therapist, an incredible problem solver, and a cheerleader.  Without Jhun I can honestly say that I do not think I would still be at Turing.  I have watched him grow so much in such a short time and I KNOW he will do great things.  Turing is undoubtably a better place with Jhun in it and I cannot wait to see the amazing things he will do with his education." - Jill Donohue

“We’re lucky to have Jhun in 1508. His enthusiasm and humor keep us all encouraged and laughing, even in the depths of headcount. While I haven’t had the pleasure of pairing with him on a team project, I look forward to working with him more in mod 2. He’s also wins best dressed of 1508 (and maybe all of Turing?)." - Matt Rooney

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

- I donated a bike to Turing. Granted it's a folding bike haha but my hope is that students who need to get around town can utilize it.

- I've noticed that in the weekly shout outs people will shout me out as being encouraging or that I made them laugh throughout a stressful day. I Think that people matter and that their story matters as well and it's really encouraging to see that people appreciate that. I love turing because of the knowledge they are imparting to us but I also love it here because of the community.

## Review

### Notes

* Focus on yourself. Let's talk about it during week 3 of the second module.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities (demos, lightning talks, etc)
but does not do anything else of significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses just on their own learning.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
