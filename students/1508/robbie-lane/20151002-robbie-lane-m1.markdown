### Your Mission

For my first module here at Turing, I set out to get a good grasp on ruby fundamentals.
I feel I made good use of the pre-work and after my evaluation on the Mastermind project,
I was moved from Foxtrot to Echo. In echo, I was more challenged and I believe it was
beneficial to my success during module 1. Beyond learning the basics to writing ruby,
I also feel like I have grown as an individual. Specifically, I think I have greatly improved
my ability with working with others in a collaborative process.

### Attendance

During this module I have had perfect attendance and have never been tardy.  

### Work

For my individual projects during this module, I am most satisfied with my Night Writer and my Mastermind. I thoroughly enjoyed both these projects and feel like I excelled. For Mastermind I completed some of the extensions and also felt my algorithm was well executed. I feel similar for Night Writer, but I think I did really well with TDD on this project.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

For this project we translated a string into simulated braille. I am most proud of this project, because I feel i did an excellent job using TDD.

Evaluated by Josh Cheek

*"Good job keeping the algorithm and the context decoupled (command line reading / writing files, printing summaries, etc)"*

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components 4

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

In this project i created a binary search tree, a fundamental data structure, which stores sorted data for faster lookup. This project helped me solidify my knowledge of recursion.

*"Use abstractions in your tests to protect your tests from the volatility of the interface, and to save yourself a lot of time."*

* Functional Expectations: 4

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/linked_lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure, often asked about during technical interviews.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

In this project we built the classic mastermind game in ruby. I added several extensions including some awesome ascii art. :)

Evaluated by Tess Griffin

*"each with index, awesome"*

*"Extensions! Game difficulty levels were great"*

## Team

### Projects

#### Http Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/webserver)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

For this project we built a webserver which parses http requests and serves our Night Writer application with a web interface.


* Overall Functionality: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3.5
* Code Sanitation: true
* Adoration Points: none
* Knowledge Retention: Both members got 10/10

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

In this project we used educational data from the state of colorado to query and analyze. Utilizing CSV data we parsed ~80,000 lines of data in a way that our application could utilize.  

*"Dragged the cursor of consensus forward a few times (ie sent me pull requests, ty)"*

*"The agnosticism of the code to where the loader comes from / what the loader is, is good because it allows you to swap the loader out for any other kind of loader. Which means that you can add any data source that you want, you just have to write a loader class for it to get the data (ie load_average_math_prof_by_race) from the new source (ie json, sql, xml, a hash from my test)."*

*"It's often worthwhile to do refactorings (will actually save you time, b/c the overhead of everything you do with it afterwards is lower, and you will gain much deeper insight into whatever you are working on, as you adjust its structure and identify abstrctions and names for the things that it does)"*

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Breaking Logic into Components 3

## Community

### Being a Community Member

Feedback:

*â€œRobbie was a great partner to work with. He laid out a foundation that was clear and concise with our headcount project. He was very easy to work and pair with and had great insight about all aspects of the project. He has a great work ethic and is always willing to put in the time it takes to get things."*

*"Robbie is amazing to work with. His understanding of Ruby is completely intimidating and inspiring. My only compliant would be that he needs to slow down and wait for the rest of us to catch up!*

### Playing a Part

During my first module, my biggest contribution to the community was a constant willingness to help others in my cohort. I frequently like to ask others how their projects are going and if there is anything I can do to help. In addition, I frequent the smokers stoop and am always willing to listen to people complain. I also do my part with cleaning -- putting dishes in the dishwasher and maintaining the often breaking tables in classroom A.

## Review

### Notes

* Keep doing the same thing academically.
* Little bit of danger allowing yourself to be comfortable being in the second tier. 
* Would look for opportunities to being engaged. 

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.


## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
