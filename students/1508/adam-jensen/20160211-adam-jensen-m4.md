# Adam Ki Jensen - m4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I have been waiting for M4 for SO long!I love javascript and have been eager to
spend time with javascript and the big frameworks (primarily React, and Ember).

My only goal was to learn Javascript.

I had used JS prior to Turing and spent module 1-3 waiting to return back to JS. I wanted
to use m4 as a springboard to help me:
* understand more complex JS patterns(closures, callbacks, higher-order functions etc)
* gain high level understanding of various frameworks (Ember, and React)
* gain experience with both ES5 and ES6. understand both functional and OOP paradigm.

### End of Module Assessment

### Attendance

I attended all days. I occasionally stepped out of class when dealing with video/phone interviews

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

### Projects

## Solo

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/ideabox2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

Our first project in M4. Learning to treat the Server and Client sides as two seperate entites. 
I enjoyed it. I was not too hard and I got to learn all of the jQuery that I wanted.
The best part was re-factoring with steve and realizing i suck. Serisouly, I was amazing.



#### Real-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/real-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Web-Sockets. I appreciated the opportunity to explore Socket technology. It was fun but I
admit falling behind and managing the job-hunt and project tasking poorly.

On the good side, I know how to do Web-Sockets. Which is awesome and I look forwward to
using them more in the future. I love JS.


## Team

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/snake)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

My goal in this project was to use ES6 syntax and build a game using Javascript and HTML5 canvas.
Additional deliveries include many extra feature additions to the classic game of snake and

"Vim mode is pissing everyone off I think"

280/300 points given

This was a pair project that was an exploration into un-known territory. It was a success in that
we learned a shit ton about Ember and Electron. Personally, it was a confirmation that I
love Javascript and want to work with JS.

In this week-long project I built a sudoku-solving machine. It was
evaluated by Steve with the following results:






### Feedback to Me

"It has been a pleasure working with Adam this module. His enthusiasm and desire
to push the knowledge boundaries encourages me to do the same. He is always
willing to collaborate and help anyone who needs it. I look forward to pairing
with him in the future, because we both know, VIM-ter is coming!"
-Jason Pilz

"30 years from now when I’m old, fat, and going bald and I think about my time at
turing one of the first people that will come to mind is going to be Adam Jensen.
Adam has played a massive part in my turing experience. I didn’t expect to become
really great friends with people coming into this program. I figured that it
was going to be 7 months out of my life theres simply not enough time to
developer deep friendship and relationships with anyone. I guess I was wrong.

In my book Adam will always be a friend. Wherever I go he will have a couch to crash
on. In the short time we’ve been friends he has encouraged me and has played a
huge part in my success as a developer.  I’ve always admired the way he breaks
down problems and also his uncanny ability to find the coolest parts about
programming. His drive and passion for his craft inspires me to continue
learning. He’s full of brilliant ideas and clever ways to implement really slick
features. Anyone who is lucky enough to have a guy like Adam on their team can
rest assured that the task will get done.

I am really grateful that our paths crossed like they did. Coming into module 3
I was unsure about where I was skills wise in 1508 and to be honest I didn’t know
if I was going to make it. I knew that if I was going to survive I needed to
surround myself with people who knew what they were doing and could hopefully
point me in the right direction. I’m super thankful for him and I am so
excited to see what he will build and accomplish when he leaves this place."

I’m a big Adam Jensen fan.

### Giving Feedback

** Given to Jhun **
Where do I start about Jhun! Personally, the dude means a lot. Nobody else in
1508 brings as much personality to the cohort. I don't care what others say really
. I am happy to be a 1508'er because of Jhun. Much of my turing experience has
been because of this guy.  Jhun means alot to me. We connect on issues and
topics that are more important than code. I personally have received alot of
emotional support from Jhun ever since I've known him. The crazy thing is that
I know Jhun is just as (or more) important to EVERYONE. The guy is infectious
and Turing is lucky to have him on board.  I've also seen Jhun develop and
grow as a programmer. We initially met in a time of distress and he has come
so incredibly far since then. Jhun really pushed harder than expected. As a student
and collaborater, Jhun has impressed me. I completely endorse Jhun both technically and as a friend.

** Given to Sekhar P **
I recently paired with Sekhar on Bartleby. Sekhar is a great partner that is much better at time management and getting things done that I am. I really appreciate his ability to balance jokes and work. Honestly, I dont thinkk I’ve ever joked around that much on a project (Probably a bad thing).
To go a bit further. I personally struggled during Bartleby. Sekhar is probably the only reason I got anything done. I know he had other things to do as well, but he was diligent in helping out and pulling his weight. I would fully endorse Sekhar as a partner and programmer.
Bad: Sekhar can be hard AF to read.


### Playing a Part

* On Friday, Febuary 5, I ran a student-led workshop "Getting Started with Vim". Approximately 10 Students attended and Horace was stoked.
* I've continually been the coordinator between Turing students and Wes Bos. Wes is Developer
that I had initially reached out to asking for a price discount for this React/FireBase tutorial.
I enjoy getting students started with new Technologies (React, FireBase, Javascript) while in Module. I
plan to hold this role until Wes refuses to give any more discounts.
* I had shared my experience on Course Report and we contacted via email by Ji Kim. I proceeded to share my Turing experience
with her for a couple weeks and urged her to apply. She did apply, but quickly deferred to 1603. I have continually helped her with
pre-work, and getting ready for module 1.
* I've been blogging on a regular basis throughout Module 4. blog is [here](https://medium.com/@adamkijensen)
* At long last, We had revived TAAAP. I am hugely active in this group. We plan lunches
and can approach each other for help OUTSIDE of posse of cohorts. Thank you to 
Joanne for helping get us together. I look forward to a life-long membership in
TAAAP.
