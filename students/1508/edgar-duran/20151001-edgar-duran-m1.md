# Edgar Duran - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My main goal for the module was to build a solid foundation in Ruby so that I
may continue to build on top of it in future modules. I wanted to immerse myself
in Ruby as much as possible. I also wish to continue building relationships in this
awesome place where, incredibly, I've really liked everyone.

### End of Module Assessment

For my end of Module assessment I tested with Josh and received the Scrabble Player class
as my challenge.

Feedback:

* Ruby Syntax:
Mostly kept up to date with the state of the tests
Got a little stuck with moving variable setting to initialize
The adding `@total` within `play` was good

* Ruby Style:
Nice correcting the indentation as you see it

* Blocks and Enumerables:
N/A

* Testing:
Nice descriptions of the behaviour of the Player class
Good test implementation

* Workflow:
Nice use of tools, eg command+d
Jumping between windows

* Collaboration:
Don't require my approval

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3.5
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance

I have been in attendance a Turing consistently, with the single exception of
leaving after lunch on one occasion due to illness.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL]()
* [OriginalAssignment]
(https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Build a mastermind game that allows you to play the game in terminal.

(evaluation comments)

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 2
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/Chisel/tree/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

Take and existing markdown file and conver it to HTML.

Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
Application implements all base functionality
Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3:
Test-Driven Development: 2:
Functionality: 3:
Breaking Logic into Components: 4:

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/jungle-beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)



18 tests, one failure
Tests need to verify as well as guide design.
Pop method doesnt take an argument
include method doesnt take into account the possibility that the list does not include the item we are searching for
Program does not run, insert by position does not work Scores:

Functional Expectations: 1
Test-Driven Development: 2
Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
Looping or Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

I paired with Aaron, Matt, and John for my projects

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Built a program that encrypted, decrypted, and cracked secret text based on secret keys.

Notes: Overall pretty clean code. Tests could be a little more descriptive and investigative. Overuse of instance variables. Had SRP classes, but did not follow corresponding file structure. Had runner files.

Evaluated By: Andrew
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Built analysis for csv files with school data

Evaluated by Tess

Notes:
Warned them about the bad habit of not breaking out classes into separate files
Focused on the test harness once they realized that it was a thing. Their own tests suffered as a result
Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs refactoring

* Overall functionality: 3
* Enumerables: 2
* Fundamental Ruby: 2
* TDD: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I had the opportunity to work with many people this module. I had great experiences and learned a lot from so many. My project partners: Aaron, Matt, and John were great and truly helped me throughout the process. Some of the notable people I'd like to
recognize are: Aaron, for being such a great partner and always being available to work with. Aaron and I paired often and I
know he is the reason for a large part of my success this module. Tyler, for always being available and taking initiative to teach me as well as many others. If it wasn't for him I would not have completed an assignment or two. Regis, for being a constant motivator and always willing to help. He was always quick to lend a helping hand when me or anyone else needed help.

### Being a Community Member

From Aaron:
Edgar has helped me talk through many hurdles in the first module. He has a great ability to explain concepts in a way that myself and many other students understand. Over this time, he has also become a great friend and ally. I hope to pair together on future projects.

From John:
Edgar was a blast to work with on probably the toughest project that I had at Turing, he
came up with several solutions to confusing and difficult pieces of our code. He is a team
player and level headed which was greatly appreciated as our project was overwhelmingly difficult.

From Matt:
“Edgar brought a lot of energy to our Enigma project. While sometimes he got ahead of himself (like most of us), he’s always excited to share his ideas and open to hearing someone else’s. He was also very willing to work with me regarding our schedule, which is super helpful when you’re trying to still have something of a life outside of school."

### Playing a Part

I tried to be active and participate in the Turing community during this module. I attended the field day, though I had a lot of work pending, because I think it's important to be involved in the community where you spend so much time. I also volunteered to help coordinate the welcome night for the new 1510 cohort as well as regularly trying to be present and lend a hand at Turing whenever possible. I enjoy taking pride in my work area and try to always clean up and keep things around Turing organized whenever possible.

## Review

### Notes

* Put a high emphasis on project management.
* Finish Head Count

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

Provisional

* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
 

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
