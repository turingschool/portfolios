# Aaron Careaga - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

I am at Turing to challenge myself, learn a new skillset and way of thought, and combine my interests in technology, finance, and behavioral sciences. The past few weeks have been some of the hardest yet most rewarding I've experienced. Moving from Washington prior to starting the program, and spending 10 to 12 hours a day, almost every day of the module, has taught me a lot about myself, communication and software development.

### End of Module Assessment

I successfully completed the end of module assessment (challenge 2: reading game data) with Josh Cheek on 9/28. My task was to implement the WordFinder class for the Scrabble game. I built two methods that allowed the user to iterate through a dictionary and returned words that could be built from supplied characters.

**Feedback:**

Josh thought that my Ruby syntax and style were in good form, and the code displayed no issues. I named 15 enumerables off the top of my head and eventually found the right enumerable to implement for the challenge. While testing, I described the methods in a way that conveyed my understanding and established clear expectations for each step in development. My workflow exhibited good tabbing between panes. Because of my anxiety, it took some time to wrap my head around the challenge wording but we were eventually able to get on the same page.

**Scores:**
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3


### Attendance

I attended all days and classes on-time, arriving each day about 45 minutes before warmup to review material and prepare.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the first module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

I recreated the Mastermind game using Ruby and played from the command line. Projected evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

**Notes:**
Noted areas to refactor into contained methods. Conveyed the Ruby syntax and naming was on track.

**Scores:**
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 2
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

I built a Markdown to HTML parser that took in an input text wrote an output file. Projected evaluated by Tess Griffin.

**Notes:**
Tess thought that my TDD and Ruby style were strong. She conveyed that I should fix the formatting converter by realigning logic that was broken while refactoring.

**Scores:**
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Functionality: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

I implemented a link list in Ruby that read an input text file, played the beats, and allowed list manipulation from the command line. Projected evaluated by Mike Dao.

**Notes:**
* 38 tests, all passing
* Some opportunities for refactoring
* some methods could use helper methods that were already built
* testing could use some better specificity
* testing needs to check that methods not only do what they have to do
but also that they dont mess anything up
* Playing functionality needs to be split out
* FileIO needs to be split out
* Great use of the splat
* Many opportunities to refactor and to split off code into individual
methods

**Scores:**
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

Below is a list of team projects I participated in during the first module.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Penney Garrett and myself built an enigma program that encrypted, decrypted, and cracked text. Our project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

**Notes:**
* Tests could be more robust. Example - used a lot of refute or assert instead of assert_equal when appropriate. This was due to some random nature of some of the elements. Could have focused on some more edge cases and different scenarios.
* Variable and method naming was strong. Cracked encrypted text with good speed.

**Scores:**
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

**Feedback:**

Penney Garrett: "Aaron was a great partner for Enigma. He is excellent at breaking apart and tackling complicated problems. When the going gets tough he stays calm and just approaches the issue from a different angle. And on a personal note, I'm still struggling a lot with feeling capable enough, and Aaron stayed patient and encouraging the entire process. I really learned a lot from him and feel I've definitely made a friend and ally."  

#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Matt Rooney and myself built a data analysis suite to help policymakers and the public better understand education statistics in Colorado. Our project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

**Notes:**
(notes)

**Scores:**
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Enumerables: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

**Feedback:**

Matt Rooney: "Working with Aaron was an absolute pleasure. Nothing seems to rattle him and I really appreciated his patience, both with me and Headcount. He was thoughtful and explicit in communicating his ideas and concerns, which was crucial with such a challenging and dense project. I feel like we both learned a lot together and from each other. I look forward to working with him again."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided critical feedback to partners in both group projects, Penney Garrett and Matt Rooney. I also gave feedback to Elliot Winkler, a mentor in the Lovelace Posse that I met with regularly on Thursday's during the first module.

I wrote feedback for Emily Dowdle and Edgar Duran for their portfolios.

### Being a Community Member

* Emily Dowdle: "Pair programming with Aaron lacked many of the roadblocks I’ve experienced with other pairs. We decided to take five minutes to individually experiment with ideas in IRB and then came together to recursively create a custom method equal to .flatten. Aaron’s positive attitude made him a joy to work with and his logical insights filled the gaps in my own thinking, allowing us to efficiently develop a solution."

* Edgar Duran: "Working with Aaron is an absolute pleasure. I can't say enough about how great of a partner he is. He is an incredibly hard worker as well as a knowledgable one. At no time was I ever worried that we would not accomplish our task because I knew Aaron's organization and work ethic are superb. He absolutely made me a better partner if only because I wanted to live up to the hard work he does. If it were up to me I'd pair with Aaron on every project."

### Playing a Part

* I regularly mountain bike with fellow students and instructors, riding at least one day every week of the module.
* On field day, I drove a group of  students and their bikes to the Lulzbot Factory and Devils Backbone open space.
* On Monday, September 7, I wrote a blog post called Skiers Who Code. Topics covered included my experience at Turing and learning Ruby relative to those I've shared in the mountains.
* On Tuesday, September 22, I wrote a blog post on motivation and overcoming challenges. It discussed my experience handling stress and expectations during the first module, and techniques I've helpful to enter a flow state.
* I helped David Daniel, a recent Turing graduate, move residences on Saturday, August 29.
