# Ryan Johnson - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission as a Turing student is to not only become the best developer I can be,
but to also have a positive impact on my cohort and the Turing community. To
Embody what a Turing student should be and to put forth my best effort in
everything I do.

### End of Module Assessment

My end of module assessment was performed by Tess

1. Ruby Syntax & API - 3
2. Ruby Style - 3
3. Blocks & Enumerations - 3
4. Testing - 3
5. Workflow - 3
6. Collaboration - 4

### Attendance

I missed September 14 and September 15 because my son was sick. I was, however,
still able to remotely participate in our git class assignment and the reading
for those days. I was able to pair with my partner to start our pairing project.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Exorcism
The Exorcism's I completed really helped me enforce the concepts that we
performed in our projects. I was able to practice formulating test as well as
letting the test lead me to the correct implementation of the code.

* Hello World - A program that greets the user by name, or by saying
  "Hello, World!" if no name is given. Completed 9/8.

* Hamming - A program that can calculate the difference between two
  DNA strands. Completed 9/16.

* RNA Transcription - A program that, given a DNA strand, returns its RNA
  complement. Completed 9/19

* Gigasecond - A program that will calculate the date that someone turned or
  will celebrate their 1 Gs anniversary. Completed 9/19

* Raindrops - A program that converts a number to a string based on the number's
  prime factors.


#### Night Writer

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/night-writer

In this project, I implemented a parsing engine that translates regular text
into braille. I was evaluated by Jeff Casimir

* Would like to see more small tests as you're building up
* Do some refactoring to reduce repetition in implementation
* Braille to standard characters not yet implemented

* Overall: 2
* Fundamental Ruby: 2
* TDD: 2
* Components: 2

#### Binary Search Tree

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/binary-search-tree

In this project, I built a binary search tree, which is a fundamental data
structure that is useful for organizing large sets of data. I was evaluated by
Josh Cheek.

* Base expectations
* One extension
* Test all pass
* 18 examples
* Pretty good examples
* Choose names that describe behaviour, not tests
* Nice BST, your life will be simpler (and less buggy) if you delegate the work
to the nodes instead of trying to do it all in the bst.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerable and Collections: 3


#### Linked List

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/linked-list

In this project, I built a linked list, which is another basic data structure
that is an ordered set of data elements. My project was evaluated by
Tess Griffin.

* Only didn't finish 3 methods. Did a good job with the others
* Needs to test more than the bare minimum. Also didn't have test for all of the
methods

* Functional Expectations: 1
* TDD: 2
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


#### Sorting Suite

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/sorting_suite

In this project, I implemented three different types of sorting algorithms that
include bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. My project was evaluated by
Josh Cheeks.

* Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge Sort at 30 %
* All pass
* Organized into lib and test dirs (keep them all in the same ones)
* No edge cases
* No syntax errors
* Indentation is fine
* Style is fine
* Good naming allows me to read a piece of code without having to go innundate
my brain in how it is implemented (aka: good job) :)
* Has a dir structure
* Each gets their own file
* Uses git

* Functional Expectations: 2.5
* Testing: 2
* Ruby Style: 4
* Organization: 4

## Team

### Projects

Developing the group projects was an eye-opening experience. They really showed
how complicated a project can be. I really feel that all of the principles and
concepts that I have learned so far truly came together during this time.

#### Headcount

* https://github.com/robbielane/headcount

In this group project, we built a database that queries Colorado school district
data from a a externalfile, creates connections between related data sets and
uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions concerning the school
districts. My project was evaluated by Josh Cheek.

* Basically up to date with the cursor of consensus
* Dragged the cursor of consensus forward a few times
  (i.e. sent me pull requests, ty)
* Watch indentation
* It's often worthwhile to do refactorings (will actually save you time, b/c the
   overhead of everything you do with it afterwards is lower, and you will gain
   much deeper insight into whatever you are working on, as you adjust its
   structure and identify abstrctions and names for the things that it does)
* Passes most of the harness, minus disparities in interface consensus
* Test harness runs in 3 seconds
* Your tests run in 11ish seconds, 1 failure, the one currently being tested
* The agnosticism of the code to where the loader comes from / what the loader
  is, is good because it allows you to swap the loader out for any other kind of
  loader. Which means that you can add any data source that you want, you just
  have to write a loader class for it to get the data
  (ie load_average_math_prof_by_race) from the new source (ie json, sql, xml, a
   hash from my test).
* The current format is incidental, so choose a format that makes sense to the
  class you're developing. Then that is the common format that all of the loaders
  will transform their data into.

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### HttpYeahYouKnowMe

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/web_server

In this project, we built a web server that can receive a http request, send a http
response, and prints out braille in the web browser. My partner was Tyler and I was
evaluated by Josh Cheek.

* No comments

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Code Sanitation: true
* Adoration Points: none
* Knowledge Retention: Both members got 10/10

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Throughout the module, I gave constructive and concise feedback to the Turing
staff as well as Turing students. When giving students feedback, I tried to
be as frank as possible, while keeping them abreast of the positive aspects of
their work.

Feedback I gave to Robbie Lane: â€œRobbie was a great partner to work with. He
laid out a foundation that was clear and concise with our headcount project.
He was very easy to work and pair with and had great insight about all aspects
of the project. He has a great work ethic and is always willing to put in the
time it takes to get things."


### Being a Community Member

As a community member of Turing, I tried to be a positive influence on the
community members around me. I felt that I did as much as possible to help my
fellow student.

* Feedback from Robbie Lane:
  "Ryan put in the time necessary to accomplish such a large project. He was a
  joy to work with and was the main force behind refactoring."

* Feedback from Jason Pilz:
  "Ryan has been very open and helpful throughout this module. He has been
  willing to collaborate and give opinions when asked, and has consistently been
  a positive person in our cohort. I have enjoyed each opportunity to work with
  Ryan that I have had."

* Feedback from Pat Wey:
  "I had the pleasure of pairing with Ryan toward when we were working on our
  Night Writer projects. He was easy and fun to work with, and he has a genuine
  conviction about programming that is inspiring. He's open and receptive to
  feedback, and an awesome communicator. I sincerely hope the random group
  generator puts us together soon."

### Playing a Part

During my time at Turing, I had the opportunity to interact with many different
people within the Turing community.

* I was fortunate enough to participate in Student Advisory Board every
  Thursday, where we discussed student issues and ways to improve Turing
  as a whole.
* I reviewed Arron's inital linked-list project and gave him some guidance based
  on what I learned from my project.
* I gave guidance to Arron and Matt on ways to improve their design of Headcount
  on 9/21/15.
* I helped Jill with a git problem that she was encountering while making a new
  git repository.

## Review

### Notes

* We like that you included Exercisms.
* Would love to see you adopt the people behind you.

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.


## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.


* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
