# Tyler Komoroske - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During this module, I felt like I made major strides in my understanding of writing Ruby. It was awesome
to actually be able to implement my ideas in Ruby this time around, as opposed to the first module when
the code itself was a major hurdle for me. I'm looking forward to moving on to module 2 and continuing
my learning in the field of software development. I'm confident will Turing will be one of the most important
stepping stones in my life, and couldn't be more excited to see where this takes me.

* Feedback from Chad:
* Tyler - consistently one of the hardest working people in the module, always friendly and available to help people with coding challenges.  A great attitude when pairing - very focused and motivated.  Could use some work on time management, but strong communication skills do a lot to mitigate any issues.

## Community/Feedback to me

* I've included some feedback from my classmates below:
* From Marlo:
* Hey Tyler. I know you didn’t ask, but I thought I’d give you this ‘review’ of sorts, simply because I know I couldn’t have gotten this far without your constant help and collaboration.

* Tyler is a defining reason for my survival and continuation here at Turing. Every week I expect him to post something in the channel letting everyone know he would be around to help in case they were having trouble. His description of concepts surrounding the lessons and ideas taught were so well thought out and thorough, that I can’t help but to thank him for past assignments almost every time I see him. I don’t know if I could have succeeded if it weren’t for him. The sheer willingness to help me and my cohort mates has, in fact, made me want to do the same. He’s sort of a model for a great student anywhere and I can’t describe enough how much I’ve appreciated him. Tyler will undoubtedly be a phenomenal developer someday.

* From Edgar:
* Tyler is one of the most helpful people I have met at Turing. He is always willing to lend a hand an personally tutor
you if you feel behind or need help on anything. Most people at Turing are willing to help, but Tyler takes initiative in
helping others by organizing and leading tutoring sessions. He is always available and will find time to help if you ask for it.
Tyler has walked me through very tough problems on multiple occasions and has been a huge reason I have not fallen behind on my work.
His calm demeanor and natural teaching style has helped me as well as other people truly grasp concepts and understand complex problems in Ruby.
I attribute a lot of my project breakthroughs to lessons from him and am truly grateful to have him as mentor and cohort mate.  -Edgar

* From John:
* I had the fortunate circumstance to cross paths with Tyler this fine module 1.
In my opinion there is no one else in 1508 who is more approachable, helpful,
or as good at helping others understand the material then St. Tyler. Without
his help, my project grades would be much lower and I would not be at the
strong position that I am in. It is my opinion that Tyler is probably the
most important person in this module. He is also extremely good looking, also
thank god for his football team as they lay the smack down on Notre Dame
this weekend, amen.


### Giving Feedback

* I always gave actionable and useful feedback to all classmates when asked or given the opportunity. Chad and I had a bit of a rough start to Headcount, however due to useful feedback from both sides, we were able to come
together and turn in a pretty good project in a short period of time. If it wasn't for our effective communication and feedback, I don't think we would have been able to turn in a satisfactory project.


### Playing a Part

* During this module, I tried to extend as much help as I possibly could to my classmates and it was very enjoyable for me. I was able to help my classmates understand some abstract concepts and at the same time, I was able to reinforce my own learning. I consistently offered help to my classmates during the evenings and tried to make sure I was explaining concepts that made sense to my classmates who asked me for help. Overall, this module was an extrememly rewarding experience.


### Notes 

* Extend some of your helpfulness and be the same voice to the posse as you are doing in the cohort.
* Inform the new people in your posse that they are getting help.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
