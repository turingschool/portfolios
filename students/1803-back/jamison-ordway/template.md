# Jamison Ordway - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
Over the past six weeks I have strived to build a thorough understanding of fundamental programming concepts and Ruby conventions. At the beginning of the module, I had no prior knowledge of Ruby aside from the Turing prework. Now, I feel relatively comfortable discussing Ruby code, as well as psuedo-coding and problem solving without using a specific programming language syntax.
I have also been very committed to professional development and learning how to work efficiently with other people. I have learned more about this during M1 than I have with multiple workplace experiences combined.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled the most with finishing functionality of my assignments before the deadlines. Along with this, I struggled to balance my own hopes and expectations with the reality of learning to program. I have found that having a fundamental understanding of the material and having a process should be top priority, as getting faster comes with experience.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I did not complete all the desired functionality of the final paired assessment. I am happy with my level of collaboration, communication, and breaking problems into logical components on this exercise. I have since revisited the exercise and completed the functionality, in order to strengthen my comprehension.

Similarly, I did not reach the desired functionality of the final independent timed exercise, however, upon reviewing my code with an instructor, I was able to improve the functionality of my code.

My personal self assessment is that I have taken major strides since beginning at Turing, and that I am ready to move on to Mod2.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work and projects has improved drastically since I began my time at Turing.

#### (Date Night)

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/jamisonordway/date_night

Recursive calls missing base cases and certain parameters

EVALUATION SCORES
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 2

DESCRIPTION
Learning Goals:
Practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components
Practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels
Understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works
Practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses

EVALUATION COMMENTS
Completed through iteration 3
Git workflow was messed up

EVALUATION SCORES
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Version Control: 2
5. Functionality: 2

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of Mod1 I had two opportunities to work closely with a classmate on a project.

#### (CompleteMe)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JudsonStevens/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment]()

DESCRIPTION

EVALUATION COMMENTS
Spec Harness should be run with rake test
VCS

Judson is committing more than Jamison
Good Git Workflow, especially with PRs and branches
Testing

Shouldn't use CompleteMe object in Node test
Node should have more tests. Missing checks for accessor behavior
Helper method insert_words in complete_me_test is covering up the method call
Only testing insert with one word in the test file. Populate does insert, but we need to test if insert is working on its own. By only testing populate, you are integration testing but not unit testing.
test_populate_returns_an_array_of_strings saving expected to a variable is unnecessary
test_search_returns_false_if_word_not_in_trie has no assertion
Can order tests by complexity
test_it_can_delete_a_word duplicate test
test_count_can_go_down saving expected to variable is confusing
missing test that delete doesn't delete nodes with children
Lots of redundant tests
No tests for search
All your methods should be tested
Implementation

has_key? already returns a boolean. No need to say == false
I love all the comments about what the method does!
If you are recalculating the count every time, there's no need to have an instance variable count
In count conditionals, you could use an if and an else instead of an if and an elsif
Count conditionals could be refactored
A lot of if <condition> == true. The == true is unnecessary
Actual Deletion could be refactored
Good use of helper methods

EVALUATION SCORES
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 2
4. Version Control: 2
5. Functionality: 2

(feedback to me)
I had a great time working with you on the project. Our two styles seem to mesh very well to me, and I really appreciated a more testing focused mindset to influence my code first approach. The tests that you added were extremely useful and really helped to focus my ideas down into manageable areas. I appreciated the conversation we had to DTR which really clarified what we both needed to do. Our processes are definitely different, and I hope seeing my process possibly showed you another way to approach the problems we were given. I see us as two sides of a spectrum, and I think both of us could benefit from taking ideas from the other. Again I appreciate the different perspective and had a good time working with you. Definitely looking forward to working together again.

FEEDBACK TO ME

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Week 1: Health & Wellness)
* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md
The Gear Up session dedicated to health and wellness set me up for success during M1. I recognize that the hardest week I experienced during M1 was partially due to my failure to implement the strategies that we discussed, an example being deep breathing and exercise to avoid hyperarousal of the brain. Now I start my day differently and use my Pomodoro breaks to either practice mindfulness, do some physical movement, or nourish myself with water and good food.

### Gear Up
#### (Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)
* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md
The Debugging the Gender Gap Gear Up session was my favorite of our Gear Up sessions, and I have continued to think about my role as an ally to people who are less represented in tech than I am. Software developers should be intentional about forming diverse teams with evenly distributed responsibility for any given project.

### Gear Up
#### (Your Smartphone as a Civil Rights Issue)
* [GitHub URL] (n/a)
Your Smartphone as a Civil Rights Issue was another wonderful session that shed light on digital privacy. I especially appreciated the time allotted for writing a personal manifesto related to digital privacy, and I will continue to work on mine.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

One of my favorite things about being a Turing student is working with other people and sharing the knowledge that I have. I look forward to being able to pair with new students as I move through the upcoming modules.
I have done my best to provide specific, actionable, and kind feedback for everyone I work with, be it students, staff, or mentors.
I have really enjoyed participating in the LGBTQ affinity group, Queer Qoders. Being an active member of this community will continue to be a priority for me in my professional career.
During the next module I would like to become more active online with blog posts or participate in something like the Turing podcast.
