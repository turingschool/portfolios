# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

My goals this module included getting comfortable with the process of building a Rails app from the ground up, as well as staying involved with
the Turing podcast and increase my presence on social media with blog posts and similar contributions.

Another goal that I had was to keep working with Mod 1 students and reviewing material from the previous module.

I'm very happy with my progress in all of these areas, especially with the time I have spent reviewing fundamentals. I have even extended
this work to my social media, creating video tutorials on Youtube that will hopefully help newer devs in their journey.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**

I struggled the most with learning SQL query syntax. With this challenge, I learned that incrementally learning how to use ActiveRecord
helped me focus my attention on certain aspects of SQL. Over the upcoming break, I hope to familiarize myself with more advanced concepts
in both of these technologies.

## Blog

**Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).**

In this blog post, I discuss my process for turning user stories into feature tests using RSpec.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

My favorite projects this module were Rails Mini and Bike Share. I really enjoyed both of these because the concepts of MVC
had really started to stick at this point, so I felt more compelled to focus on creative problem solving.

Rails Mini in particular was very fun to work on, because I had creative license to build things the way that made the most sense to me.

My least favorite project was Little Shop, simply because everything felt so new, and I found that it is sometimes more difficult
to troubleshoot Sinatra apps. In the future, I hope to manage my time better when I'm learning a brand-new framework or library.

**What did you learn from your independent projects?**

Learning how to explain bugs and issues to someone who is not working on the same project was very valuable during Rails Mini.

I also learned a great deal about authentication and authorization during this project.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?**

During Mod 2, I learned a great deal about sharing in-person feedback with my teams. I also felt that these experiences were great practice
for having an Agile process, where features were regularly revisited and improved.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**

"Empathy and Privilege" was my favorite Gear Up session for this mod, because I feel that this is one of the most important discussions that software
developers can have in order to improve team dynamics and the quality of software that we build.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

I felt honored to be part of the Turing Podcast and the Student Advisory Board. I also prioritized pairing with Mod 1 students when they
needed some extra support. Between week 5 and week 6, I was a TA for a try coding event, which was a great experience.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I hope to continue with the podcast and pairing with other students.
