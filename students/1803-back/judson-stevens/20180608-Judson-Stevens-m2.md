What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled with the ActiveRecord/Sequel portions of things, and realized I need to spend more time on my own figuring those things out.

This is a short blog about the Black Thursday project of Mod 1.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  The rails mini was interesting, and really put into perspective the amount of work that goes into building a good, and good looking, application. My least favorite was probably Little Shop. I know it's our introduction into MVC but it seemed to end up being a lot of focus on making the wireframes. That's a valuable skill though, so I know it's useful as well.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned a lot about how to keep myself motivated, and the type of balance I need to be productive.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I continued to learn how to work with others in a productive fashion when it comes to software, which is a different thing than any other group I've been involved in.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  I really enjoyed the Mod 4 gear up, learning about public API's and getting some ideas on how to use them.
  
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I made myself available to pair with multiple Mod 1 students in order to further their learning.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I'd like to be more active in the posses.
