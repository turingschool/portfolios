# (Angi Colling) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module? I celebrated all accomplishments, no matter how minor. My goal from the beginning of module one was to be able to write tests, and properly format "correct, quality" code. I feel that I was successful in the goal I set, however, I still feel like I need to gain more confidence and deeper understanding of coding basics in Ruby. )

## Rubric Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

(I failed the end of module assessment, and will be repeating.)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(What did I learn in my individual projects? I learned that when I get frustrated, I need to walk away and focus on something else for awhile. I also learned that the struggle is a benefit in coding, it helps me retain basic concepts. I also learned that I don't give myself enough credit for accomplishing small steps in my projects.)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

What were my favorite projects this module?
If I had to pick a favorite, I would say CreditCheck was a project that I did not dislike. I understood the concept behind Creditcheck and the Luhn Algorithm. Because the algorithm was clear to me, I felt executing the code was easier than in the other projects.

What were my least favorite projects?
I did not enjoy JungleBeat. I struggled the most with this project. I am not sure if it was the concept, or the coding that I struggled with, likely a combination of both. Conceptually, this project was a far reach for me.

#### (NightWriter)

* [Original Assignment]()

(What did I learn from the paired assessment? I learned how to work as a team. I learned how to use my strengths as a proficient typist, and Manoj's skills in problem solving, to create a navigator/driver relationship. We both learned that open communication was vital for the team to work together cohesively.)

(Feedback:
gitignore the coverage
Use ARGV[1]/[0] to get command line arguments. Use them for the filenames
Make sure to follow the interaction pattern. I should be able to tell it which files to read/write
Try not to create unnecessary instance variables. The intermediate values shouldn't be Ivars.
Too many Ivars makes tests harder to read
Lots of integration tests. Not enough unit tests
Each method should be tested on it's own, including the helpers)

(Ruby Syntax & Style: 2,  Breaking Logic into Components: 3, Test-Driven Development: 2, Version Control: 3, Functionality: 3)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session 1: Growth Mindset, Debugging Gender Gap, Technology in Medicine)

* [https://gist.github.com/amcolling/3dac8c3fd3009357045e951532aa1473]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

Growth Mindset: Many people have a fixed mindset from their previous careers. People may have invested a lot of time, and energy into their careers. The fixed mindset that "this is it", or "I just need to bide my time to retirement", are mindsets that are counterintuitive to the "growth mindset"

Debugging the Gender Gap: This gear up was my favorite. To hear and see how far women in technology have come, was personally inspiring to me. I do not plan on doing anything differently than I have done in my prior career. I have always been very determined and persistent against all odds.

Technology in Healthcare: I choose this gear up because of my experience in healthcare. I feel that the medical field can really benefit from great technology. Early diagnosis through collaborative data sharing, and nano technology is pivotal in helping us progress in healthcare. I plan on pursuing a career in healthcare IT, and I am hoping to make a difference.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

What was your favorite gear-up, and why?
My favorite gear up was "Debugging the Gender Gap". In my previous career as a laboratory scientist, I did not experience anything negative with the gender gap. Statistically, women make up the majority in the laboratory field. Hearing how women have struggled in technology, and how they have overcame those obstacles was inspiring.

How did you contribute to the Turing community?
I participated in all group activities, in school and out of school. I spread the word of how great Turing is in my community. I also tried to be a leader in my class when I could. I helped with cleaning the kitchen when needed. I unloaded the dishwasher more than once. I also helped other students when I could.

How do I plan to participate next module?
I am repeating module one. I plan on hopefully having more confidence in the next module. I'll raise my hand more often and try to help other students. I may also join a posse.
