# Christopher Powell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to learn the fundamentals of object oriented
programming. By the end of the module I had achieved an approximate
70% understanding. I hope to achieve 100% understanding by repeating this
module.

(feedback to me)

Was an awesome time working with you and bouncing ideas back and forth,
and your researching skills on the problems we faced during the project
really helped us get unstuck.

Keep it up on working with those exercises to get more exposure to tests and
methods! With more practice on creating good, small tests; method creation will
become a second nature to you, and you'll be rocking it out in no time!

Thanks for your go-with-the-flow disposition! If there was a paradox of
"engaged while laid back", you'd be the living embodiment of it, and I really
jived with it. Hope you pair with you again in the future!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

The professional skills curriculum was designed to help students hone skills
that they will apply to the social aspects of being a developer.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

The mental health and wellness gear up was very beneficial in helping provide a
perspective that can be employed while at Turing. The Turing school is very
challenging and can cause levels of stress that people may have not been exposed
to before. The take away is it is important to not allow oneself to fall into
habits that cause more stress than neccessary.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Debegging the Gender Gap is a subject that is very important not only in the
world of software development but the world in general. The gender gap is a
systemic issue that needs to be confronted in a world that creates inequalities
for its people. It was brought to the surface in this gear up that a lot of
software is being engineered naively for the people doing the engineering. In a
world like ours, where software is becoming ubiquitous for everyone, there is a
need for diversity in the development process to avoid unseen and unnecessary
discrimination.   

#### (The Value of Introverts)

* [GitHub URL](n/a)

The Value of Introverts was very informative about the group mentality of
progress in our society. Psychological introspection has revealed that there is
a spectrum of productivity that ranges from extrovert to introvert and
everything in between. A number of history's most revered figures were
introverted and were able to contribute greatly by exercising their capabilities
in an isolated environment. Recognizing that your introverted doesn't mean that
you're antisocial but it does mean that you need to express this facet of your
personality so that you can do your best work for the group.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did not participate in very many community activities but I was very friendly
with my cohort and I believe I created a friendship with everyone. With people
who were at my level I was able to give advice and with people who were above me
their advice was easy to obtain.
