# Jude Dutton - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- Looking to accomplish
  - Building a full web application with a front and back end
  - Learning how to use databases with Rails applications
  - Learning Rails
  - Learning MVC
- Was I successful?
  - I was successful in building a few web applications with a front and back end during this module.
  - I was happy to learn Postgres and how it integrated with Rails via the ActiveRecord ORM. I would definitely like to continue my learning to see how other languages handle this.
  - Definitely feeling confident with Rails.
  - I feel confident with my understanding of MVC.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- I struggled most with learning ActiveRecord querying this module. After much failure at getting this to work in my code, I was able to employ some pattern recognition learning to get over that hill and I now feel comfortable with ActiveRecord.

- This helped me learn that I am much better at learning by trying and failing, recognizing the pattern, and extrapolating my new knowledge from that, rather than memorizing and forgetting.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

My topic was way too large so I'm cutting it back into parts. The first part linked above dicusses one way of designing code by starting from the bottom up, using tests to design your code, and then writing the code needed to pass them. I want to focus on how this process is a great way to design clean and optimized code, but it's going to have be a series.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- My two favorite projects this mod were the Rails Mini and Bike Share projects.
  - I like Rails Mini because it gave me the chance to be creative and build something I was excited about. It also gave me an appreciation for just how difficult coming up with ideas for apps and implementing those ideas successfully can be.
  - I was excited about Bike Share because it was the first time I really felt confident and excited about the process my team was using. We really got detailed and worked well together throughout this project and it made me feel much more comfortable working in a group.

- My least favorite project this mod was probably Job Tracker.
  - This was because I was struggling a lot with ActiveRecord queries at that point and it severely hindered my ability to contribute to that project in a timely manner. We had a viable project in the end, and my partner and I worked well together, I just felt bad that I was not able to contribute up to my potential due to that obstacle in my knowledge.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I learned that I do enjoy working in groups and that I'm not as much of a self-motivator as I thought. Being responsible for the entire app from the idea all the way to the user interaction felt like way to much. I was wishing I could've been working in a team the whole latter half of that project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
- Process! Teamwork! Sincerely though, it was wonderful struggling with my group projects and ultimately arriving at a place of getting excited about working in groups for Bike Share. I feel that I can continue contributing to group processes really well and can mark it as a strength that I can do so where it was once a failure.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite Gear Up was definitely the Gear Up on Empathy. I really appreciated speaking about the need for empathy candidly and in a detailed manner with the peers in my cohort. I wish we could do more of this.

- My least favorite Gear Up was my the Community Gear Up that I went to. I appreciated the content and I believe the group put in good effort, but I think that the execution could've included some more presentation. It was good to discuss with my peers about failures we've had to get used to sharing that type of information; however, I think there could've been a bit more balanace between content presented and discussion with others.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- Due to my limited time, I still did not reach my goal of being able to join a posse, but I still am aiming to reach that goal by next mod. However, I was able to pair with Mod 1 students this module and I certainly benefited from helping others with code. It's pretty great how much one learns when you're trying to help others.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I would definitely like to find a posse to join and spend some more time helping students in other mods.
