# Mellisa Luce - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I was hoping to gain a thorough understanding of the concepts as outlined in the course. I was successful in learning much about each topic and I improved greatly. But I do feel that I did not reach those expectations.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle? There was much struggle. Initially, I did not realize how important asking questions and getting clarification was. I plan to reach out much more. I have also struggled finding a process for breaking down and tackling the problems. After each project, I have worked to improve that process. Managing my time for studying and projects has also been a challenge. I will try to set a more structured timeline for review and project completion.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Strength Finder
* https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/intro_strengthsfinder_session.md

One of my favorite Gear Ups was the first Strengths Finder. People seemed excited to discuss their strengths. I enjoyed getting to talk to several Front End students. It was also interesting to learn how many traits the students share.

#### Working Styles
* https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/working_styles.md

The Gear Up on working styles made me more aware of my working style and communication preferences. I was able to go forward feeling validated. It also helped me acknowledge that the working styles of others may be completely different but that harmonious collaboration is possible with communication.

#### Learning to Pair
* https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md

The DTR Gear UP was also a good introduction to communicating professionally. I learned that there will be communication challenges. We discussed recognizing those challenges, as well as how to address and overcome them. I learned how to discuss what our roles would be and our expectations for each other. The DTR Gear UP also helped me learn how to talk about what I can offer a team which helped me when partnering in class and during projects.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module? I've taken the opportunity to get to know many of the students at Turing. I believe I contributed to the community by being a source of positivity and support for many of my classmates. I will look for more opportunities to contribute.
