# A: End of Module Assessment

| ---------------------------------- | -----: |
| 1: RubySyntax & Style:             |      3 |
| 2: Breaking Logic into Components: |      3 |
| 3: TDD:                            |      2 |
| 4: Version Control:                |      2 |
| 5: Completed Functionality:        |      2 |

> Despite failing the assessment, I was proud that I got as far as I did with the information I recalled from the completion level of previous projects. I had a difficult time working with the CSV class. In hindsight, I would study more before the assessment to better prepare for it.

# B: Individual Work & Projects

> I felt very good about each assigned individual project, overall it was worthwhile to understand my limits and take them to new heights when I would overcome an obstacle. For the obstacles I couldn't overcome alone, I felt encouraged to be able to work with someone to help solve my problems. This was done by shaping concepts into questions into answers.

# C: Group Work & Projects

> Taking my limited experience with individual projects here at Turing, I was excited to be able to help others help themselves learn. While the projects were not fully successful in implementation, they were great for initiating collaborative effort.

## NightWriter

[Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

> Practicing breaking a program into logical components, applying enumerable techniques, never reached reading and writing text to files.

Partner Feedback

> Working with you was a blessing because you showed me a tenacious approach to coding. When a hard problem came our way, instead of ceasing under pressure, you displayed a confidence that the solution would soon present itself if we kept looking for it. This mindset helped me immensely to break through a negative pattern I was starting to create. If we pair up again I would only ask that we could approach a new project at the same speed as each other. There were only a couple of times where it was difficult keeping up but for the most part you were receptive to my questions and confusions.
> Thanks for being a great pairing partner.

# D: Professional Skills

> I fully grasp concepts and implementation of professionalism in the workplace, and leave detailed notes for git and DTRs. With a strong sense of empathy, I help others struggling on projects and work to apply growth mindset in all interactions.

## Gear Up

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from each session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

### Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

> The instruction and importance set for this session has greatly shifted the day to day interactions with myself and others. Influencing myself and others in a positive way that helps and supports rather than judge and exclude is great for a community like Turing. I have practiced this a lot even before Turing.

### Turing Citizenship #2: Cohort Vision & Getting Better at Difficult Things

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown)
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

> Brought to attention the values of students, mentors, and instructors working together to help with your success at Turing, everyone having their own struggles and the knowledge they gained through it by asking for help. I am still working on this aspect.

### Turing Citizenship #3: Public Narrative, Working Styles: Intro, Extro, Ambiverts!, Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)

> Gave a lot of insight into how individuals cope with other individuals and how those differences can be great in building a team that supports one another's weaknesses with the others strengths. Helped me with my understanding of myself as well in a team environment.

### Turing Citizenship #4: Retrospective, Personal Stories & Connection

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_retrospective.markdown)
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

> Was great to be able to understand where I have come from and where I am headed and put that into a story to tell others. Enjoyed a great group talk learning about others and where they are headed in their lives. I will continue trying to develop the story of myself to tell to others.

### Debugging the Gender Gap & Micro-aggressions in Tech

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

> There was an unexpected amount of common sense I felt when I watched the videos during the session, I couldn't believe the issue was as prominent as it is. I wanted to learn more about the experiences of those affected by these issues.

# E: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

> Collaborated with upper mod students in posse meetings to learn other computer skills, as well as with peers in my cohort to create a support system that helps with stress management and practicing 'rubber ducking' for projects. Attended code fairs to see what upper mods were working on and spoke with them about their own struggles with their projects. Cleaned up around the classroom and kitchen, even on days when I wasn't on cleaning duty.
