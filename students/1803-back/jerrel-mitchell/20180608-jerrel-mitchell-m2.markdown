## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

> To learn how to take the knowledge gleaned from mod 1 and apply it to higher level projects and learn rails.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

> The amount of work expected to be completed was an absolute monster for me. I hardly ever had time to even structure my time to more effectively order the mountain of information I was expected to learn and complete. I learned that I can be a pretty decent head-manager of a project with less sleep. Odd. Also I learned that I work really great under pressure. Somewhat.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

> Answer to both: All of them. The experiences and learning I gained from them caused a great deal of joy, but the time crunch and the constant pressure and differing instructor expectations made it way more stressful than I was anticipating.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

> That I do much better when part of a team.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

> That I really enjoy collaborating with others to solve problems.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

> They were mostly forgettable. I really like that they do these exercises as part of the curriculum, but personally for me it did not contribute to my knowledge or wellbeing.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

> I was an emotional bag drop for many who needed someone to talk/cry to, was great getting to know many people and learning how to better process my own emotions through helping others.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

> Ideally doing something similar, I think I would also like to help others with interview prep or mini coding challenges.
