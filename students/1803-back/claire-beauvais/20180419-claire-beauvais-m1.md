# Claire Beauvais - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
Unfortunately, I did not succeed in this module but I think I have been invested in the class and the work from day one to the final day.
I have tried to understand and use well TDD in order to write proper code, watch videos again and again about the base (class, methods, instance variable ...), and I tried to practice as much as I can with the exercises in order to be faster and understand more how to build some methods, how to get information from hashes for example.
I realized at the mid module and working with Cole how important debugging is and that I was not using pry enough. Also that it is important to reach and ask for help and I plan to do that more.

* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 1

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I failed the end of module assessment.
I have to have a better automatism when doing exercise assessment timed/paired to get further. I am doing the first or two firsts iteration when I should already be at iteration 3 for example. Especially because as it gets more difficult I know that I will need more time.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is a recap of the projects I have been doing for module 1 :
Mastermind week 1,
Jungle beat week 2,
night_writer week 3,
flashcards week 4,
Mastermind (again) week 5,
event_reporter week 6

#### (Project Name) = Mastermind

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/Mastermind2.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind

Create a Mastermind game so a random and secret sequence of 4 digits (letters) that the user has to discover. 4 colors can be a part of the solution : blue, red, green, yellow and the user will have a feeback about how many correct color and correct position he discovered.

(evaluation comments) None

(evaluation scores) No scores

#### (Project Name) = jungle beat

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/Jungle-beat-.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat

Make a very basic drum machine program using Linked List (type of data structure)

(evaluation comments and scores) Lack of Functionality to be graded.

#### (Project Name) = Night writer (see below paired project)

#### (Project Name) = Flashcards

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/flashcard.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards

Write a flashcard program following a spec.

(evaluation comments and score) None

#### (Project Name) = event_reporter

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/event_reporter.git
* [Original Assignment] = https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/4814d5517ed3a6cd33e717df535cdb0c0c5a9b8a/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

Based on the same data file, build an interactive query and reporting tool which fulfills the expectations below. Re-use data cleaning procedures from the original EventManager to handle dirty input and generate beautiful output. We are also going to explore creating our own HTML files and using an API.

(evaluation comments) None
(evaluation score) Not graded


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I have been doing night_writer with Cole as a paired project.

#### (Project Name) = Night_Writer

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/colehart/night_writer.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer

(description) = In this project weâ€™ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

(evaluation comments) =
Applicaton works
Only uses default filenames
watch the pattern where you're storing everything in ivars as opposed to having methods send and receive messages to each other
make sure you are following the specification exactly as given
comments will communicate why you made a choice, the code will explain how.


(evaluation scores) =
1) Ruby Syntax and Styles = 3: Meets expectations
2) Breaking Logic into Components = 3: Meets expectations
3) Test-Driven Development = 3: Meets expectations
4) Version Control = 3: Meets expectations
5) Functionality = 3: Meets expectations

(feedback to me) =
I was happy to pair with Cole as it helped me realize things that I could improve and work on. Such as using more pry for debugging, breaking the projects into smaller components.
It also made me realize the gap between him and I regarding our level and understanding in Ruby and coding which is a good thing but also a difficult one in just few weeks. But it was not a surprise and the mid module evaluation was a confirmation of what the paired project made already clear.
I, objectively, would have not done this project as far and as well by myself.

## D: Professional Skills

Here are the Gear up I have been attending for module 1 :
Week 1: Health & Wellness,
Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap,
Week 5: Your Smart Phone is a civil right issue

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name) = Week 1 Health & Wellness

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

  It was really interesting to talk about this topic and figure out about the different type of stress. How stress affects our life quality and our work and what we can do to lower the stress. I definitively pay more attention to breathing and to keep breathing "normally" and deeply even during a moment of stress. I also know that exercises like running help me a lot to reduce stress and that I should do that more often while at Turing because yes we are under a lot of stress.

#### (Session Name) = Week 3 Code: Debugging the Gender Gap,

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md

  As a woman, I can relate on things that we have seen and talk during this gear up. I also watched again on Netflix the documentary about debugging the gender gap in tech. I am not surprised that few women are part of the Tech industry but I do believe school like Turing or bootcamp in general might help because there is no stigma about women.

#### (Session Name) = Week 5 Your smartphone is a civil right issue

* [GitHub URL] = None ?

  I was really please to see that many people at Turing are concerned about privacy and are aware that it is an issue.
  I was already using Signal on my phone to have encrypted message and I definitively use it even more after this topic.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I have not participate a lot in the larger Turing community but I have been involved and try to help or boost the moral of people in my cohort.
