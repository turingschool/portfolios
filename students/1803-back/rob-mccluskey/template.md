(evaluation comments)
Make sure you're following the interaction pattern. We want to be able to specify the file names.
Try to keep expected and actual correct
Good job ordering tests by complexity
Try to do some edge case testing such as empty files
Every method should be tested, even the helper methods.
Lots of Integration tests but not enough Unit Tests

(feedback to me)
Rob did the project really well; I had expressed to him how I wanted to complete at least one project during Mod1 and he was determined to make it happen, he did a really good job on the project. Rob took the time to go through the mythical creatures exercises with me to help try to catch me up to speed. I get frustrated easily when I'm not understanding a concept as fast as I would like, and Rob did a good job taking the time out and trying to help me. During the project, I expressed to him that I didn't understand what exactly is going on in the project, I asked him for us to do driver/navigator so that at least I could write some code and have some practice with it. Unfortunately when I brought up driver/navigator he didn't respond to me, he told me to work on one portion of the project, but at the time things were getting really advanced for me, and I needed some guidance just to do some of the simple iterations. After having a few days of not understanding what he was doing, not having any effective communication, and trying to get some idea of the direction that he is taking, I eventually just gave up, he was going to to do it on his own anyway. After giving up since I noticed I wasn't getting anywhere I tried to understand the code and at least see what was going on, he tried to help others with some iterations but it became so complicated that even they couldn't understand. I could get some of the concepts behind it, but I was so lost when we had our evaluation. A lot of the information that he gave to me has been helpful, and also there has been some parts that has left me more confused than what I started with. An improvement would be working with his partner to look up the information together to not only show to look for it but to be completely sure that the information is correct. When we were making the DTR paperwork, I told him that I work from 8am-6pm Saturdays and 12pm-5pm on Sundays, he decided to put that I'm unavailable on the weekends even when I told him that I'm more than able and willing to meet him to discuss the project and start on it Saturday or Sunday, he said he would meet me at the school on Sunday but never showed up, he did apologize for it, but what upset me that instead of talking about the direction we are going to take or how to start it, I noticed that he already pushed some code he already had on Saturday. I don't like being ignored and I don't like feeling like I'm not contributing to the team, but I'm not going to waste energy on situations where I'm clearly not valued either. An improvement here would be to really listen and process the information that the partner is giving out, repeat the information if necessary to make sure that you both are on the same page. I appreciate the fact that he heard that I wanted to complete a project in Mod 1, but I felt like he left me behind and took control of the project. I'd much rather have had an unfinished project and can completely understand and explain the code in my sleep than to have a completed project that I know barely anything about.

Working with Rob on Black Thursday was a great experience. Rob is very good
with keyboard shortcuts and refactoring. I learned a lot from that. Also, when
we did driver/navigator I found I could focus better on concepts when I didn't
have to focus on syntax. I feel we have different approaches with regards to
debugging, and I think I've learned to start prying quicker when trying to
logic through the problem doesn't produce results quickly. One thing I noticed
when we were getting help from some people with one issue, I could tell they
were focused intently on our code, and I felt Rob may have continued to
re-explain the issue making it difficult for them to concentrate on our code
and help us solve the problem. It all worked out pretty quickly though, so no
big deal.

## D: Professional Skills
Took part in Growth Mindset, Getting Better at Difficult Things,
Working Styles, Managing Stress, and Personal Stories

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth Mindset is about having an open and flexible mind. There is no black and
white, and everyone is different. Accept others for who they are, don't judge.
Always be open to learning, never think you're done.  This has not changed since
my first time through this mod.

### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I have learned using pry to start a new method gives me access to all the data
I need to work with, as well as providing me a sandbox to play in and figure
out how to manipulate the data.  Emotionally still doing everything recommended.
Relied a lot less on mentors this time around.

### Gear Up
#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

Very interesting, loved this one. I find no one is fixed on the Introvert /
Ambivert / Extrovert line, but move around depending on things like our mood,
and where we are. I find I am about 70% Introvert and 30% Extrovert, but I try
to be more Extroverted.  No change this second time through.

### Gear Up
#### (Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Nothing here was new to me. I have been battling stress and depression for over
thirty years. This had no affect on me.  No change, this second time through.

### Gear Up
#### (Personal Stories & Connection)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This seemed like some foundation for later on when we begin the job search
aspect of Turing. However, I found it overall not helpful for a student. This
would be better to save for Mod 4 when we need a story of who we are to tell
prospective employers.

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap & Microaggressions in Tech)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This was a good one to experience, sad to hear that the number of women in the
tech industry fell so dramatically.  I am learning about microaggressions from
Rachel, and had my eyes opened to a few.  I have locked down some more sides of
my humor, in hopes of keeping myself from offending someone.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Volunteered to help with multiple TryCoding Weekends(TA and Panel)
Helped classmates when able
Entered into conversation with students I did not know just to be friendly
Joined #Imposters
