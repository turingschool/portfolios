## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I set out to accomplish the following:

  | Goals                        | check |
  | -----------------------------| ----- |
  | **Further Ruby Knowledge**   |       |
  | **Proficient in rails**      |   X   |
  | **TDD first**                |   X   |
  | **Deploy a web app**         |   X   |
  | **Stay calm**                |   X   |
  | **Learn CSS and HTML**       |   X   |

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Learning to cope with the automagic of sinatra and then rails. Coming from mod 1 everything was laid out in a logical and explicit manner... that was not the case in mod 2. It was a ton of memorization without a ton of reason or background. I just learned to trust the process. The conceptual foundation behind these helper methods in rails, query's in AR, etc. all came around towards the end of the mod.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project even though it was a disaster when presenting, was the rails mini project. 
  I was able to hone in on the things that I felt I was weak on, like CSS and HTMl to the point where it is one of my strongest assets to my team in Bike Share.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
 Like I said above, going into my independent project this mod, my HTML and CSS was weak. I spent hours upon hours working on those skills and built a solid foundation that will hopefully serve me well in the coming mods.
What did you learn from your paired projects?
  How to work efficiently and coherintly with a group of one or more people. These group projects were frustrating at times, but overall served as extremely valuable learning experiences.
## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  Worked with the mod 1 students to ensure that they were having a good experience academically as well as making sure that they fealt that they were part of the community.
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to join a posse. I'm not sure which one yet, maybe the Health and Wellness Posse.
