# (John Livingsto) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for mod 1 at Turing was to build a solid programming foundation that will prepare
me for mod 2 and beyond.

I feel that this was accomplished over the last 6 weeks. I feel extremely confident in my ability to tackle
nearly any ruby based problem and work through it piece by piece.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Mastermind)
  Build and test a simple guessing game. Work on building different classes and using a runner file.

  No git hub location

#### (Date Night)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexcutschall/date_night)
  * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

  Creating a binary search tree that can insert information and sort it
  correctly. Then being able to traverse the tree and access several levels
  of information

  
    - Stores depth in node
    - Read spec more carefully
    - Tests should be more explicit, i.e. the expected value of sort should be the sorted array of hashes, not   just testing it has the first one

  Breaking Lines into Components: 3
  Test Driven Development:        2
  Version Control:                2

  #### (HTTP)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jliv316/HTTP.git)
  * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

  Introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

  - Git flow: would like to see more frequent commits
  - More testing

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (CompleteMe)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brickstar/enigma)
  * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

  Practice breaking a program into logical components
  Testing components in isolation and in combination
  Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
  Reading text from and writing text to files

  - LOTS of pull requests... you may have gone a little overboard, but still great to see you using them.
  - I like the organization of tasks with the requirements.md
  - Jude committed more than John
  - Spec harness is passing
  - Great job gitignoring the coverage metrics
  - Prefer not to see a method called "delete_continued". You are breaking up the method, but it should be       named in some logical way.
  - Flag isn't a great variable name
  - test_doesnt_suggest_completed_words is confusing because it does suggest a completed word
  - I like that you are testing the structure of the tree
  - Lots of edge case testing. Good job!
  - Good use of fixture data
  - Every Method should have a test, i.e. sort_suggestions and unweighted_suggestions

  * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

  Creating a program that has the ability to find analytical information
  from pulling from several different repositories.

## D: Professional Skills
The past two paired projects and gear up sessions prepared me to be able to effectively comminicate 
project goals and expectations that I believe will directly transfer over into the professional workplace. 

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Health and Wellness)

  This session focussed the potential mental stresses of Turing and how to deal with them in your own way. They drove home the concept of the growth mind set and how important it is to adopt in comparison to the commonly defaulted fixed mindset.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Working Styles)

  This session educated us on the different types of people, introverts, extroverts, and ambiverts. I found it helpful to learn about others and their different learning styles so that I could better approach a paired project.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Debugging the gender gap)

  The presented video showed the shocking realality that the computer science industry and tech industry for that matter is prodominantly male. It also talked about the recent push for computer science courses in early education and similar problem solving exercises to get kids interested in STEM.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Choice Session)
   
  We watched a Ted talk on the recent impact technology has made on the medical industry and the impact technology will and can make on the future of medicine. We played a short trivia game, and talked about some of the highlights of the video. 

## E: Community Participation

  ### Playing a Part

  How do you contribute?:

  I have made sure to be welcoming to everyone I've come into contact with here. I have pushed myself to step outsie my comfort zone, and have hopefully inspired others to do the same. I have focussed on helping others when my understanding is sound, and have tried to help out anyone I see struggling.
