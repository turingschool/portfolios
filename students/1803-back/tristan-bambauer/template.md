# (Tristan Bambauer) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing with little idea of what to expect. I set out to be challenged and to learn more about my place at Turing. These goals were admittedly broad, but they have become narrower as my time here at Turing has progressed. They have become more about becoming proficient in specific areas of Ruby. I don't, however, feel successful. My driving force in learning is to know everything about any topic. I can do things now that I didn't dream myself ever doing six weeks ago, but I am in no way done. In the specific confines of Module 1, I would say I have been successful, but that doesn't satisfy my desire to accomplish things.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

My favorite project was Jungle Beats. Jungle Beats was the first project that I saw the enormity of what I could build with the tools I had available. Night Writer was a challenge that I didn't expect to get. My least favorite project was HTTP. I feel more confident in working with tools that I don't necessarily understand, but it didn't force me to learn everything about TCPServer. I did have some good mentors that went through it with me, though.

#### (HTTP Yeah, You Know Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TristanB17/HTTP_Yeah_You_Know_Me)

In this project, I built a server in Ruby that accepts HTTP requests and returns responses based on the request.

## B: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/justinetroyke/night_writer_2)

Students made a program that translated English to Braille and back.

Notes: Application mostly works
LOTS of repetitive code
Some unneccessary methods that dont do anything
Application does not match the spec
Runners should be able to use any file.
Dictionary should be in separate file and use a reverse
FIle IO in runners should be pulled out

Thank you for working with me, being patient with me and enduring my music while we worked together. I enjoyed celebrating our breakthroughs during the project. On future projects I would encourage you to follow a tighter git/github workflow to ensure there aren't any merge issues, I know we both could have been better about our commit and workflow pattern when it came to that. Thank you for pushing through to the end with me, I know you gave up sleep and really brought a lot to this project, I am glad we got to work together.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zdcthomas/black_thursday)

Manage and integrate multiple databases, providing basic analytic support and data calling.

Notes: Overall pretty good Working except a couple methods from I5 Good testing Some opportunities to refactor - replace each with map, break things out to variables (evaluation scores)

You were so fun to work with, it made the long hours we put in way more pleasant. You were always willing to put in the time needed, and your perseverance is amazing.  It was really awesome to see how you were always looking to improve your understanding of the code base. I especially appreciated your presence when we were working through the methods of iteration5. Your positivity made that so much easier to work through and kept us both from giving up much sooner I feel. It was awesome working with you. The only thing that kept coming up (more at the beginning than towards the end of our pairing) was that sometimes it seemed difficult for you to hone in on exactly what the problem was that we needed to fix. It seemed that when you slowed down and looked in a more focused way at what we were trying to do, you could often solve the problem easily.

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

It was good for reinforcing positivity and adopting the appropriate mentality to start learning.
It was helpful to hear people talk more about it. I think it provides students with a strong foundation to
start their time here.

#### (Introverts, extroverts and ambiverts)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown

Everyone sees themselves differently, and usually it involves placing themselves into a social category.
In this case, introvert, ambivert and extrovert. It was nice to learn that we are all a little bit of each
kind, and not simply a certain way.

#### (Personal Story)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown

I really enjoyed picking a story and identifying the themes that resonated most with my own personal story. It is good to start thinking about this skill early in the program, and I can see how the story we are building here will be invaluable in the job hunt. I have a hard time sharing sometimes, and it was good to start developing the skill early on.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

Women in technology is an important topic, and I think we all learned more about it in this session. The video clips shown
were very informative. Of all the sessions, this one was my favorite.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I sang at karaoke. I think people liked it.
