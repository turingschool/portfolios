# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Learning Javascript, having a better understanding of frontend/tackling problems from a top-down perspective, integrating a frontend to a separate backend.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Getting past CORS errors! Also, learning to deal with JavaScript's ambiguous error messages.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
A better understanding of one of the internet's most popular languages. It'll be a great and fundamental building block for learning REACT (something I plan to do in the not too distant future).

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Looking online/asking for help from other students.

* What did you learn?
Building an Express backend with a knex ORM, how to make a (very) basic node js app

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
Wording things in a way that made sense and conveyed my knowledge of the subject

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Practice in answering questions that may be asked on an actual interview. -- This isn't my answer but I agree!
Also, it was nice seeing the last seven months pay off. I'm still not even close to an expert, but I'm much more knowledgeable!

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I'm not quite sure how I solved it, but I do know that in the future, I should speak more slowly and elaborate a little more
on answers/take more time to think about the questions I need to answer.

* What did you learn?
A better means to more accurately answer questions I know the answer to.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Handling all the DOM manipulation as I was just learning JS; ALSO: overall file organization was difficult with JS,
I wasn't sure which methods to export or if I should just make bigger JS files.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Lots of online searching for solutions/asking colleagues for help/referencing older projects of mine to see if there were any clues I could use to solve an error.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Discovering new ways/interesting tricks to use with JavaScript

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
DOM manipulation, knex in the database, how fetch works with promises.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I don't think I got the opportunity to do enough testing in express... I mostly just made endpoints.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
It was great, because I got along with my partner very well.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Exchanging a JWT token between the front and backend for authentication.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Playing around with CORS until finally we figured out how to expose the token in the headers.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Working with frontend. They were a great duo and my partner and I worked very well alongside them.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Setting up the devise-jwt gem between a rails api backend and REACT with REDUX frontend.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
Be more thorough in your documentation; I now use waffle.io much more frequently and leave more elaborate and clear git commit messages; travis CI has also become an essential part of any repo.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
It was difficult, and we built the lesson around sparking student discussion. Luckily we had students who seemed interested in out topic, so it went very smoothly.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
Hosting Karaoke and participating in SAB, both were very rewarding experiences.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Communicate with team mates via slack/email/waffle, be open and honest about capabilities/constraints, providing good documentation, ALWAYS USE A CI.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
* [30planlink](https://gist.github.com/TristanB17/a3cc9844799275657fc7946178f6cc5f)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
