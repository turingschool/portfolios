# Steve Schwedt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn object oriented programming, GitHub, TDD, and lay the ground work for being in a position to get a job. I think I did and I am ready for mod 2 with Rails and databases.

## A: End of Module Assessment

passed - 3 on all sections

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned a lot about Ruby concepts, object-oriented programming, TDD and how to approach new projects. I think I improved from the start to my last individual project.

#### Date Night

* [https://github.com/apoc64/date_night]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night]

A binary search tree. I learned the basics of node/tree based data structures and got better at general problem solving.

(evaluation comments)
Make sure you're committing smaller chunks of code. Make sure you're committing at least once per hour.
Need to be testing Node
Your tests can also check structure of tree to be more explicit
Good job edge case testing
Make sure you're reading the spec carefully
Don't store depth on nodes
Ternarys a little confusing

5. Functionality: 3

#### HTTP: Yeah You Know Me

* [https://github.com/apoc64/know_me]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me]

A basic HTTP server that handles get and pull requests. I learned to keep location based information in seperate classes from other Ruby objects in order to help unit testing and TDD. I got better at string manipulation, using hashes, and general structuring of classes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I think I am generally a good collaborator, but I have room to improve.

#### Complete Me

* [https://github.com/zdcthomas/Complete_Me]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me]

A trie for handling auto-complete. I learned GitHub collaborative workflows and pairing strategies. I got better with tree/node based data structures.

(evaluation comments)
trie_test should be renamed to complete_me_test
could gitignore coverage
Node children would be better as a hash
assert_equal false should be refute
no test for helper methods i.e. delete_parent_nodes

(feedback to me)
I had a great time working with you. I think that we defined the relationship well, and you held to every responsibility you had. You completed tasks well within the amount of time we decided on and the tasks were completed well. Thank you for keeping in communication about ongoing tasks over slack. I think we both had a few slip ups on being in the wrong branch on git, but i think we were able to work through those issues well when they came up. I'd be happy to work with you again.

#### Black Thursday

* [https://github.com/rcm32000/black_thursday]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday]

A system for handling and analyzing merchant and customer data. I learned about using modules and got better at structuring a program using a larger number of classes. I utilized hashes more effectively to improve performance and gained more experience with GitHub collaborative workflows.

(feedback to me)
Amazing pairing work, I really enjoyed being the driver, you were a great navigator.  The things you figured out were incredible, and I felt awesome that I was able to contribute to our project in ways you recognized.  Really appreciated the encouragement and teamwork you constantly gave! I felt you would get frustrated at times about small things. I get it, I've been there and felt that, but I would appreciate a slightly calmer approach.
## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
I think it is important to always be learning and growing. I like the idea of I don't know this yet instead of thinking you're not good at something. This is something I've always felt to an extent but I like that it has a name and a more specific way to think about it. This helps me approach learning and growing in a more deliberate and serious way.

#### Introvert/Extrovert/Ambivert
* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown]
It was interesting to read, learn and discuss introverts/extroverts/ambiverts. I think I understand myself better now. I am more introverted than extroverted. I do have a number of extrovert qualities, but at times where I get a lot of social interaction I definately recharge my energy when I am alone. I think this helps me function better when I know what I need to be my most effective, along with empathising with the needs of others.

#### Personal Story
* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown]
I think its important to be able top tell your story. I also thought it was good being in groups and hearing about other people's story. I felt a lot of similarity with other people although I also thought I was using very genaric ways to describe myself and what brought me here. I need to move forward with this and get better at telling my story.

#### Debugging the gender gap
* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md]
There is a definate gender gap in tech. One side effect that I had not considered is that teams lacking diversity are simply less effective since they are less able to consider alternative viewpoints. When we split up and discussed how our education and background prepared us for Turing, I felt that mine had, whereas several people felt that it had not. We, as an industry and as a society must find ways to address this. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I took time to help people who were struggling with material and sit down with them one on one or over Slack and help them to understand what their code was doing or how to approach projects or exercises. I shared breakthroughs I made on projects to help others. In the future I hope to be a mentor to other Turing students and find other ways to support the community.
