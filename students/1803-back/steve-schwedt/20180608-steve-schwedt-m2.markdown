## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why? I liked the mini project. I was able to plan the project around what I wanted to learn and structure it accordingly. I found job tracker my least favorite. I was new to Rails and was slow at it which I found very frustrating. I also feel like we got started before I could fully understand and plan the project which caused us to hit some speedbumps.

What did you learn from your independent projects? I figured out ways of planning a project that work for me and can carry ovr to group projects. I liked designing the app myself.

What did you learn from your paired projects? Got better at working in groups of 3, dividing up workload, project planning and communication.

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why? Personal story. I met some new people and discussed and refined out stories

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module? I paired with some mod 1 students, and helped answer questions for others. I washed a sink full of dirty dishes a couple times.
