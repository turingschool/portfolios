# Tyler Westlie - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* To learn how to create basic web applications using Rails. I think I was mostly successful.

* I would like to improve on my SQL abilities and really understand what ActiveRecord is doing.

* I would also like to know HTTP backwards and forwards. Some of the issues I ran into while building rails apps would have been more easily solvable if I had HTTP 100% understood and memorized.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* TDD, writing tests first and following my errors. Coming from mod 1, we learn what TDD is and how to implement it but it definitely was not drilled into us like it was in mod 2. I found it particularly challenging during our timed exercises every Friday. It was difficult to TDD when there was limited time to work.
* I learned to really appreciate error messages and the process of creating an app through testing. It takes more time but it most definitely will save you time down the road when you are debugging and refactoring.

## Blog

* I wrote a very brief summary of ORM's in ruby.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* I really enjoyed the rails mini project. It tested my individual rails skill and it was fun to make a silly website.
* JobTracker was my least favorite. The turn around between JobTracker and Sinatra was a little too short for me to complete the project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* I learned how to implement a very simple API to create very simple gifs.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* I think I learned the most about my git work flow. I hadn't even touched waffle.io before mod 2 and now  I feel very confident in using it for future project.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* The AI Caramba gear given by mod 4 students. AI is something that really interests me and I liked hearing the Mod 4 students perspective and opinions on it. Though, I was a little concerned with their lack of concern for the inevitable rise of super intelligent artificial intelligence.
* I honestly liked all of the gear ups. They were all very thought provoking.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I went to a Turing demo night on May 3rd. I was surprised when I understood what some of the backend students were doing. And also blown away by a project that gives a guided tour of Denver's historic buildings.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would like to attend more meet-ups and code fairs.
