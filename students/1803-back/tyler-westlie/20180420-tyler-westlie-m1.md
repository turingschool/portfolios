## A: End of Module Assessment

Evaluated By: Brian
Notes:
* Your tests are using assert_instance_of a lot. You need to be more specific in your assertions. What should these values be equal to? I could assign all my employees an id of zero and a Date of Jan 1 1970 and it would pass your tests.
* Your company tests for loading data should be more rigorous. You are only asserting one value for the first entry. I would like to see you at least asserting the length of the data loaded. You are also not testing the return value of the load methods i.e. the hash with the result and error message.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

These are the individual projects I worked on over the last six weeks.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tywestlie/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

With this project I created a linked list with the functionality of an array. The end goal was to insert beat box noises into each of the nodes and play the sounds from the terminal.

#### HTTP yeah you know me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tywestlie/HTTP_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

With this project I created a server using ruby. It was built to listen for get requests, then parse the information from the get request and respond according to the path given in the web browser.

Completed through iteration 2

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These are the group projects I worked on over the last six weeks.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JHighland/Nite_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The primary goal of this project was to encrypt a string of english letters into braille characters no longer than 80 characters. Then translate the braille characters back into english text.

Application does not match specification
Does not output to files
Translation only works from English to Braille
Pull out dictionary stuff to separate class/module
Overreliance on instance varibles to allow access to infofmation throughout the class
When using an enumerable to shovel into or add to an empty collection, there's probably a better enumerable to use

Justin Highland:
I really appreciated your patience, flexibility and communication throughout the project and working with me when I was having a tough time with certain concepts and explaining things over and over again to help.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/manojpanta/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

The goal of this project was to create a system that manages data from CSV files. We needed to create database operations that could create, read, update, and delete information from the database. Along with CRUD we needed to make sure that the responsibilities of each classes were encapsulated.

Manoj Panta:
It was nice working with you in this project. Despite of having a confusion of  whether we gonna finish the project, we actually managed to finish the project ahead of time and i feel like we did pretty good job. I really appreciate that you were patient with my typing and and impatience. Liked the way you pseudo-coded a lot of problems that helped to solve it faster. I really enjoyed answering and explaining things that were unclear and new to you. I recommend keep doing that in further mods too. I believe we both have learned a lot from this project and we both are stronger than before. One thing i would recommend is to be more present. Sometimes i feel like you are thinking about something else and i find you completely off the track (just sometimes). Again, we did pretty good job on this project. Hopefully we get to work together again.

## D: Professional Skills
These are the gear up sessions I attended.

### Gear Up

#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This session focused on keeping your mind and body in shape in order to deal with stress. My main takeaway from this session was that I need to use physical activity to manage my stress. During my time at Turing however I did not make very much time to exercise, I mainly devoted my life to working on projects. Going forward I will schedule certain days of the week for exercise so I don't lose my mind.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Unfortunately I didn't think much about this topic before coming to Turing. I haven't been exposed to the tech industry so my assumption was that most tech companies are fairly diverse given how Turing was set up. Diversity is something that is important to me and is important to making strong teams in the work place. The example where they designed a voice recognition system that couldn't hear women illustrated this idea perfectly. Going forward this is something that I will pay much more attention too.

#### Public Data & Changing the World

* [GitHub URL]()

This session went over public data api's and how to access them. It went over a few examples of projects based on using this data for their application.  I really enjoyed this topic because it gave me a few ideas for future projects when I progress with my coding skills.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Transition to Turing life was very difficult at first and making time for things outside of Turing didn't work very well. During Turing class time I went to all of the wrap ups and SAB events that were available to me. I also went to the guest speakers we had during the module. Going forward I'd like to go to more activities outside of class like code demos and I'd also like to network with people in modules 3 and 4 much more.
