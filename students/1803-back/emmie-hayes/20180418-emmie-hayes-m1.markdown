# (Emmie Hayes) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I didn't come to Mod 1 with any clear expectations.  I knew nothing about programming outside of what I gathered from the pre-work and I recognized from the pre-work just how unfamiliar the territory was going to be for me.  Nevertheless, I persisted.  I wanted to push myself beyond what I ever imagined possible for myself.  I guess I could say my goal was to start the program.  Because I knew if I started,  I would finish.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Repeating Mod 1


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/credit_card_check)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check)

This project had us build a program following Luhn's algorithm for validating credit card numbers.  We were not required to implement a test; however, I saw the value of testing immediately and therefore used it to stay on track.  Overall, this project made me fall in love with programming.  This was the first and only project I completed.  I also completed the extensions, built a test and refactored down to a final product that I felt proud to have my name on. Exposure: Classes, File structure, TDD

This project was not scored

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental CS data structures. This project focused on building a singly-linked list which meant it needed to have a head, the starting point, followed by a series of nodes linking to one another in a chain.  Each node would hold a sound in the form of a string and a pointer to the next node.  The tail of the linked list would be recognized as the node whose next node was equal to nil.  Overall, this project made me fear job interviews.  This was the only project where my desire to learn outweighed my desire to complete.  Rumor has it that technical portions of job interviews are likely to test this understanding so I dug deep instead of wide in hopes of taking more away than a grade. Exposure: Multiple Classes, Linked List, TDD

This project was not scored.  

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Conceptualizing servers and sockets was difficult at first and TDD was lacking; HOWEVER, I took a lot away from this project.  I think the key for me was that I got a late start because I spent the weekend preparing for my Mid Mod. It was helpful for me to learn about what was going on (HTTP lesson- Mailman metaphor) before starting the project.  It made the overall experience more enjoyable and I welcomed the challenges that were presented along the way.  Had I started the project before the lesson I am almost certain I would've freaked out.  Exposure: HTTP process, Faraday, Postman

Evaluation comments:
Could have broken out of loop instead of closing server to avoid error

Evaluation Scores:
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 2
4. Functionality: 2
5. Version Control: 3


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Paired Projects

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/night_writer/tree/kim)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

In this project we were asked to build a program for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and then reversing it back to Braille using text files.  Exposure: Braille, FileIO, Runner File, Pairing

Evaluation comments:
Application only converts from english to braille
Runner file only handles two filenames
Opportunities to refactor - pulling blocks out to separate methods
The pattern of #each putting something into a collector local variable and then returning it is a sign a better enumerable could be used
If a method sets something to a local variable, you can probably pull that out to another method

Evaluation Scores:
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Version Control: 3
5. Functionality: 2

Partner Feedback:
First, I want to start out by saying how much I appreciated having you as my partner! It amazes me how fast you learn and grasp on to things. You were really good at using your resources and searching for what we needed. Even when you didn't understand how something worked you still put your best effort to ask questions. One thing that we could've benefited from is taking more breaks, especially during those times when we were stuck on a problem for more than an hour. I noticed we worked best when we gave each other timers with some sort of plan. In the future I would suggest being more open to your partner's ideas and feedback in real time. It was also helpful when we were able to speak and communicate when one another was frustrated. I wish we would've done that sooner. Overall, I thought we were a great team, I learned a lot from you and I enjoyed working with you.

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness- Week 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Generally, I pride myself on my health.  It's the one thing that I have never found difficult to maintain...until Turing.  Now, I find it extremely difficult to force myself away from my computer.  I made a vow to myself during this Gear Up that I would walk the steps of the building at least once a week. I did it for two weeks in a row and then stopped.  I was able to rock climb on the weekends and hope to find even more time in future mods as I feel it is very complimentary to programming.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap- Week 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This gear up was one that I will always remember. Not only for the way I felt watching the video but the conversation that my group had following.  I was enlightened and energized as we moved into this crazy collective awareness of what a diverse tech industry could become.  We went as far as AI and how robots could be the best most diverse versions of our race if we begin diversifying now.    

#### Your Smartphone as a Civil Rights Issue- Week 3

* [GitHub URL](n/a)

Unique experience to split up and participate in a Gear Up session with students from other mods.  What I enjoyed most was when the Mod 4 students had us brainstorm questions that we can ask potential interviewers one day about what privacy means to them, what measures they go to protect user privacy and how they rid of user data once it has been collected.  It was a reminder that I have a responsibility as a programmer to protect my users and I look forward to taking that on.  I also made a personal declaration to never work for a company whose product I wouldn't use myself.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I was elected to be one of two SAB reps for my cohort.  I enjoyed working with students in other mods as well as getting to know Joanne.  
The Turing code fair was another highlight.  I met wonderful humans and was inspired by their work.  The stickers were awesome too.
