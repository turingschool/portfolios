# Matt Bricker - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* I set out to solidify the new technologies introduced in this module. While I understand that is an ongoing process, I feel comfortable and confident with what I have learned throughout the mod.
* I continue to push back on the wall that is complex problem solving. I have made a concerted effort to stay in control of my application as I build it. This requires careful planning, and scoping down each step of the problem to the most granular piece. It is through this careful planning, confidence in my problem-solving process and thoroughly breaking the problem down that I achieve this control.
* I also made a concerted effort to grow as a professional. I have started to change my frame of mind about what I have to offer in a technical career. Although I have much to learn (and always be learning), I can visualize myself as a successful developer.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I still struggle with an up and down of anxiety levels while at Turing. I am learning that trust in my process is increasing and that I can have a better handle on leveling out the anxiety through this trust.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* I learned a lot from others' process. I gained new strategies for styling that really stepped up my ability.
* I also learned a lot about organization and preparation. The agile process of both of my teams was very effective through the use of project management tools.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I really enjoyed the confidence I had with the material of the module, specifically being able to help others in my class. Not only is it satisfying to help others, it really helped to solidify my knowledge.
