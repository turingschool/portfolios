# Matt Bricker - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Most of all I wanted to learn to use Ruby and object-oriented programming as deeply as I could with the time allotted. I wanted to continue to improve and develop my process of breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces. I am excited for the opportunity to continue to grow professionally and become more comfortable in high-pressure situations in preparation for technical interviews.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brickstar/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project we’ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

###### Evaluation Comments

* gitignore coverage
* Make sure you follow the spec. We should be able to take files as command line arguments
* Memoization and Modules are nice!
* Storing the dictionary with hash makes your program flexible
* You actually don't need any instance variables. You can just use the return values from each method and pass those around
* I really like that your output method breaks things down into steps
* scan__row method breaks the DRY principle
* Great use of helper methods
* Use of Ivars makes tests less readable
* In your latter tests, you're relying on the helper methods to set up your state, when really you should just be manually setting the state.
* Lots of Integration tests. Not enough Unit tests.
* Removing Ivars would make the deliniation between unit and integration easier

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

####  Health & Wellness

* In this session I learned that talent can be cultivated through hard work, strategy and effective input from others. With this mindset, you set yourself up for higher achievement than if you operate with a fixed mindset - the belief that talents are innate gifts. I absolutely want to worry less about looking smart and put that energy into actual learning. During this module, sometimes I would avoid seeking effective help from instructors in fear of not "looking smart."
* Here at Turing, rewarding effort, and chasing the feeling of reward that comes with the struggle, are critical to my success. I firmly believe that adopting a growth mindset mentality will lead to good things.
* I want to use these strategies to continue to battle any negative narratives that inhibit my learning. Writing down negative thought patterns helps me realize how ridiculous and unrealistic they really are.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* I really enjoyed this session, I feel very personally aligned with the philosophies we covered! I feel a lot of these concepts are directly related to why I wanted to come to Turing. I was especially drawn to the idea that human brains are innately the same, but experience greatly impacts brain growth and development. I came to Turing with the intent to make a savings account for my daughter, and with the idea that I would figure out some more specific goals as I grew. This session presented some more specific ideas of how I would like to put new skills to use - helping schools enrich their tech curriculum and making the tech pipeline more diverse and robust. This session also added depth to the important concept that you are not your user.

#### Finding Common Ground

* I enjoyed the opportunity this session gave me to take a closer look at casual communication in a social environment, and how to use it as effective networking. This is something I may have overlooked had I not spent time during this session to focus on social engagement and networking. Some of the tools I learned this session will allow me to connect with a wider range of people in a social networking situation. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I love the sense of community here at Turing, it truly is one of the greatest assets of the program. I really enjoyed helping my classmates this time through the module. Passing on knowledge and experience I gained through the previous module was really rewarding. I always tried to leave spaces cleaner than when I found them.
