# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to make sure I could demonstrate a good foundation of understanding ruby on rails, as well as ActiveRecord.
I feel like I accomplished this goal and more. I have stayed determined to make sure I understand the material as well as
"burning the midnight light" to demonstrate this. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I know I struggled with grasping all of the material during the middle of the mod. There is a lot of information, and before
I went through mod 2, but it can take me some time to really understand something that is so new and different to me. Through
this struggle I was able to push forward, know what my weakeness were and work with my team members, mentors, instructors, and
friends to break through those struggles.

This is about why factorybot is now my new favorite thing. Testing has always been hard for me. I needed something to 
make me happy.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Idea box was my favorite because I really had to make sure I could learn and obtain the material. This project really helped me.
My least favorite was BikeShare. When I first got this project I was really excited, but now I'm just sleep deprived.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I was able to gain a better understanding of Rails with this project. It required some repetiveness which helped the material
sync in for me. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?

These projects are hard. They're meant to be hard because it's good to really challenge yourself so you can really feel that
sense of achievement. I realize my independent project was my favorite project, but working with a group as a team allows me 
to learn so much more such as patience, or not feeling dumb or scared to ask questions or make suggestions. We're here to make
mistakes, and when you work with a group of friends you get a sense of comfort and those dumb questions or weird suggestions 
are not quite as scary because we're all in the same boad just trying to figure out a problem. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I believe my favorite gear up was Empathy and Privilage. It was therapeutic to let others know how I can feel as a women 
in the "career world". 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I helped with other posses such as Health and Welless and suggested that therapy sessions should be moved outside just to 
get away from the basement for an hour and to relax in nature. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I want to continue helping with anything needed in the Health and Wellness posse and help students in lower mods the same as
others in upper mods have helped me.
