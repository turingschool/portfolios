# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Being a repeater in M1, it was my intent to not make the same mistakes I had made the first time around (for instance; telling my mentors and instructors that I understood the code when I didn't fully understand it, not enough practice of class methods in pry, not covering all the ruby and enum exercises etc.). This time around, I made it a point to strengthen concepts that were still fuzzy to me and work on ruby data types (hashes and enumerables), that I was struggling with the first time. I ended up learning a lot more than I expected and was able to understand basic concepts better. Although I'm still hard on myself, I feel like I worked harder this round on having a 'Growth Mindset' which helped aid me in having a strong foundation.

Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context

Notes:

Make sure the final version works!
Capitals not supported
Missing Braille to English
Test for Capitalize doesn't have correct expected value
I would rather see tests fail because the program isn't complete rather than test that pass because the tests are wrong

(feedback to me from Seth)
Sabrina, you were such an amazing partner and teacher during the time we worked on the project.  I started off feeling very lost with concepts but after spending a week working with and observing you I now feel a lot more confident in my abilities such as work flow, using enumerables and  pry.  I appreciated how you went over lines of code multiple times to make sure I understood them.  I also found it helpful when we stopped working on the project and did enumerable exercises.  I also appreciate you including me your mentor meetings.  If there was one thing that I can coach on and it's probably the only thing thing is that you were using more advanced syntax than I was comfortable with. One actionable step that you could take for your next paired project if this issue arises again is putting the more rudimentary code commented out above or below the more advanced code so it would be easy for her partner to compare the two and see what the more advanced code is doing.  Other than that my time spent working on the project with you was invaluable and am glad we got to work together!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

In Module One, career development is focused on strategies to help students be successful at Turing. The following are key components of this success:

1.  StrengthsFinder:
  - Arranger
  - Futuristic
  - Restorative
  - Input
  - Empathy

  2. Working Styles:
  - Ambivert

  3. Learning to Pair:
  - Being aware of others working styles.

  4. Feedback I
  - The importance of being actionable, and kind

  5. Strengths and Storytelling
  - Getting comfortable with talking about yourself because this is a common theme during interviews.

  6. Developer Identity
  - Getting a general idea of what type of worker I want to be and what kind of team I would like to join after my Turing career.

### Gear Up
#### (Week 1: Health & Wellness,)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I've been exercising on a more frequent basis and have food stored here so I don't go out to each for lunch. I was having a lot of trouble sleeping because I couldn't seem to shut my brain off. There were a lot of times I had thoughts about not passing again and one specific time in week 5 when I had decided to quit. I'm still working on allowing those thoughts to come through and just let them go. This is still hard for me, but community that I have built and then dedicated meditation times that I set for myself have been helpful.

#### (Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

The most memorable part of this session was the data that showed the amount of women and children that died during car crashes because airbags were engineered for men. I couldn't help but wonder if there would be similar situation if women were the only engineers that build the airbags and a study of men being suffocated by airbags during car crashes because the airbags were only designed for women and children. It just shows that there needs to be diversity in the tech industry because we're all going to have different perspectives that we can bring to the table.

#### (Week 5: Social Movements and Fake News)

* [GitHub URL](none)

It was interesting to know that the tech industry will have advertisements and may be part of creating fake news. My main takeaways from this gear up was to be aware of it and not be so gullible. I wish there would have been more information about different ways to eliminate or reduce this from happening as an engineers. We were asked what we can do, but there were no suggests form the mod 4 leads.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported the community by helping others learn how to pseudo-code, helping students with projects and ruby exercises, and mentoring others on best practices while at Turing and sharing what has helped me be successful.
