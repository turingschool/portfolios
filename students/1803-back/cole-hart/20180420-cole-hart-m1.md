# Cole Hart - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I aimed to become better at elemental Ruby language characteristics - storing data in different structures, understanding how to pass information between methods, classes and modules and becoming as comfortable as possible with the Turing educational environment.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module, I learned how to:
- guide a developer along a command line interface in game form and in HTTP
- pull and organize data received from a server and HTTP request
- encode, decode and translate data between braille and English characters
- organize and provide business intelligence data analytics on customer and merchant transactional data for an Etsy-like site

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

I built a command line interface version of the classic game Mastermind for my first project at Turing. This project solidified basic concepts like input/output, class files and runner files, and it was really fun to make. I look forward to refactoring it over the break to build out the spec more fully.

This project was not officially scored or evaluated.

#### HTTP, Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

##### Description
During this project, I built a functioning web server and learned how HTTP protocol works with TCP. I built a command line interface to ease development testing and increase my understanding of parsing code/how information passes from method to method, and learned the basics of working with Postman. I also worked with modules for the first time and stored variables in a hash versus a long conditional.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

For paired projects this module, I completed the Braille to English encoder/decoder project, Night Writer, with Claire Beauvais, meeting expectations from Mike's assessment, and paired with Jude Dutton on the final prject, Black Thursday, where we exceeded expectations.

I discovered the value of teamwork to break things down into managable components, having another set of eyes on my code, the benefits of having to talk through my decision-making process, and being able to spitball ideas with my partners. I also enjoyed refactoring Black Thursday with another person to spot different gaps.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

##### Description
Create a CLI application that generates braille-like characters in a text file from an English message in a seperate text file. Support upper and lowercase characters and special characters.

##### Evaluation Comments
* Applicaton works
* Only uses default filenames
* watch the pattern where you're storing everything in ivars as opposed to having methods send and receive messages to each other
* make sure you are following the specification exactly as given
* comments will communicate why you made a choice, the code will explain how.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/colehart/black_thursday)

##### Description
Built a system to manage data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business. Learned about HAML, partner built out frontend HAML data visualization while I finished organizing tests and code/refactoring. Mastered ways of organizing files, methods and tests between superclasses, classes and modules and working with style guides. Got much better at refactoring.

##### Evaluation Comments
  * Over all good job on syntax and style.
  * There is some room for more refactoring in anaylytics and you have some nested blocks.
  * Nice work on the implementing some frontend

##### Feedback from Project Partner
###### Night Writer
"Cole is very patient and respectful. He is also very aware of what he does "right" and what he can do better or be better at. 
He is also very helpful and made sure that I understood what we were doing. 
I think what he can improve is making sure he does not dominate conversations as that could feel disempowering for some colleagues, but he is extremely aware of that and trying his best to not do it already. For example, at the evaluation for the project he did most of the talking mostly because he had a lot of questions and lot of things to say, which was fine with me. He made sure after our evaluation that I did not feel that he was disempowering me which I did not think it was the case (because I think it comes from our different personality and me being very quiet) but maybe other people could feel disempowered in a similar situation. 
So I think he is right to ask and pay attention to that."
###### Black Thursday
"Thank you for all of your hard work on this project, Cole! Your initiative to code through some of those really difficult final methods (like one_time_buyers_top_items) really helped carry this project to completion. I also really appreciated your determination to communicate, always making sure we're on the same page, as well as your scheduling flexibility. Your attentiveness to Rubocop's formatting suggestions and general code cleanup was outstanding, and certainly a skill that will benefit you moving forward. I find it really difficult to provide truly definitive points of coaching, and I only think that there were some skills that you are already handling well as you continue to improve them, so I would like to highlight one of those. I think continuing to practice with complex collection data types and their enumerables (like when editing values of hashes) would certainly be a beneficial endeavor. Your understanding of them is solid, so it feels like it's just practice, practice, practice at this point!"

## D: Professional Skills
I enjoyed the Professional Development sessions offered by Turing this mod. I learned that I'm initially introverted when tackling a coding problem and then I like to come together as a team to work out strategies and ideas with my classmates. My favorite sessions were the "Code: Debugging the Gender Gap" session and the disucussion/slides on bias and impact vs intent in the feedback session. These sessions made me more aware of my professional identity and presence in professional environemnts, and how to leverage my perceived identity to create equitable environments and opportunities for as many folks as possible.

### Gear Up
#### Week 1: Health & Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This session discusseed stress and stress managament techniques. When we went through it, I thought it was a good reminder but didn't think I'd need to think too much about it. As the weeks wore on, I remembered the notes about sleep and drinking water, as well as exercising as much as possible. I haven't mastered the exercise piece of that equation, but hope to have more time to devote to it in the next mod. I do try and remember to keep my water bottle out of my bag/visibly on the table in front of me and keep it refilled.

#### Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This was my favorite Gear Up of the mod by far. It was really interesting coming at it as a trans man who has been on the receiving end of gender discrimination in social/workplace settings when I was perceived as female, especially how starkly that happens in the Army (especially in the 82nd Airborne Division). I enjoyed hearing more about the founders of computer technologies, seeing the nonprofit efforts around the country like Black Girls Code in Oakland, and thinking about ways to use my current and future positions of privilege and power to level the playing field and diversify the coding workforce as much as possible.

#### Week 5 Mod 4 Lightning Talk - Tech in Medicine

* [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrW3-yzWt5Q)

This session was mostly listening to the linked TED Talk and playing a trivia game about it afterwards. The TED Talk is from 2014, and had so much information about then-cutting edge technologies, especially insidables and data-sharing possibilities. It was a good thing to hear to realize how many different directions we can go in during our post-Turing careers.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was a Student Advisory Board (SAB) representative of Mod 1 BEE this inning. I helped organize and man the social for the inning, the inning code fair, suggested a relationship/significant others of Turing support group that Joanne will be implementing with the help of alumnae couples next mod, and facilitated a meetup for Queer Qoders and the board chairperson of the local branch of a national LGBTQ non-profit to help find equitable and accepting work placement for Queer Qoders. EllenMary will attend the meeting along with me and a Queer Qoder who just graduated during the upcoming intermission. I also reached out to Joanne regarding the trend of women and racial minorities repeating modules and dropping, and will discuss national higher ed trends and ways Turing can provide support to these populations with a Turing staff representative during the intermission.
