# (Charles Lee) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to gain a solid understanding of ruby and pass the module.

No, I was not successful.

I struggled with the pace of the module and didn't devote enough time to trying to understand basic concepts and terms.

I've been able to narrow down areas where I can focus on to improve my knowledge of basic concepts/terms.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Did not take


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Even though I didn't fully understand/finish it, the Night Writer project was the more interesting.

Being able to convert braille into code and having it being able to translate back and forth was cool to see.

And even though I didn't work on it, HTTP would've been the most challenging as I didn't understand much about the project and what it was asking.

I picked a few concepts and understanding of ruby/coding through each independent project.

Learning about linked lists/nodes and applying that to sounds that we can make.

(evaluation comments) N/A

(evaluation scores) N/A

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I've learned that I need to better collaborate with others by being more communicative and works with others to figure out everyone's goals/expectations and work to accomplish it.

#### (Night_Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/murphlee85/Night_Writer.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Converting Braille/English to code and using that to translate from Braille to English or vice versa.

Application does not run

Tests are often missing the assertions necessary

watch your whitespace and unnecessary line breaks in testing and in code

remember SRP - Single Responsiblity Principle - when it comes to your code - methods should only do ONE thing per method,

2, 3, 2, 2, 1



## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

Week 1: Health & Wellness,
Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap,
Week 5: Mindfulness

Week 1: Just remembering to keep in mind that there needs to be a balance between what's going on in your life and keeping your health overall. I will try to be better about making sure there is a balance by taking the time I need to do so.

Week 3: It served as a reminder the challenges the female gender has to go through especially in a developer's setting. It just further reinforced that gender does not matter when it comes to what makes a good developer or not.

Week 5: Mindfulness taught me to further take time for myself to be able to reset and recharge for the day and the coming week.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
The Gear Up session that was interesting was the Developer's session. It encouraged us to think about ourselves as developers and learn to speak/think in that way, especially when speaking with others about it.

I don't think I contributed much to the Turing community. I was very focused on the thing that worried me the most, which was not knowing how to articulate anything that related to coding. My tunnel vision prevented me from experiencing the full picture of school.

I'd like to be better about being part of the community by being better about balancing out school and life.
