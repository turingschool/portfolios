# Seth Schwartz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to have a solid understanding of the Ruby language fundamentals and
object oriented programming.  As the mod progressed I wanted to become better at
TDD, using enumerables, interacting between classes, using modules and
superclasses, and using google efficiently. I also wanted to improve my
discipline and study habits.

* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I felt confident in my Ruby syntax and styling and Breaking into logical
components.  Breaking down the classes and creating attributes for each was
pretty straight forward.  I began to struggle when we needed to parse the CSV
file.  I would like to increase my speed and complete further iterations in
the future.  I would also like to become more adept at using GitHub as I ran
into difficulty pushing and pulling this assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects were the most challenging aspect of the mod for me.  Credit Check took
me a long time to complete but I felt that I had a solid understanding of it and
completed all functionality.  Jungle Beat was very difficult to comprehend and
even after it was due I did not fully understand it.  I felt that it was too
complicated of a project for my knowledge level at that time.
 I felt Flashcards was very helpful in my understanding of TDD which I was weak
 in at that point. Mastermind was difficult initially but after getting help I
 was able to understand and complete a decent amount of it.  Event reporter was
 probably the most difficult as I still need to
learn and improve my ability on working with CSV files.  I did not get very far
but I fully understood the code that I did have.

#### (Credit Check)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

Description:

The Luhn algorithm is a check-summing algorithm best known for checking the
validity of credit card numbers.

The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually
 appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This
 full account number must pass the following test:

from the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the
value of every second digit
if product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14),
 then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
take the sum of all the digits
if and only if the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid

#### (Jungle Beat)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

Description:

In this project we’re going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically,
we’re going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let’s also use this project as a chance to
 explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science –
 the Linked List.

#### (Flash Cards)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards)

Description:

In this project, you’ll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

#### (Mastermind)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

Description:

In this project you’ll use Ruby to build an implementation of the classic game
Mastermind.


#### (Event Reporter)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/event_reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/4814d5517ed3a6cd33e717df535cdb0c0c5a9b8a/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Description:
 Let's take [EventManager]({% page_url /projects/eventmanager %}) to the next level. Based on the same data file, build an interactive query and reporting tool which fulfills the expectations below. Re-use data cleaning procedures from the original EventManager to handle dirty input and generate beautiful output. We are also going to explore creating our own HTML files and using an API.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on one group project during the mod, Night Writer.  I did not
contribute as much as my partner as she was a stronger coder but I learned a
lot of valuable information from working with her such as work flow, using pry,
breaking problems down and making methods.  It was a very valuable experience
doing my group project.

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSchwartz214/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

(The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project we’ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.)

(evaluation comments)

-Make sure the final version works!
-Capitals not supported
-Missing Braille to English
-Test for Capitalize doesn't have correct expected value
-I would rather see tests fail because the program isn't complete rather than test that pass    because the tests are wrong


(evaluation scores)
 Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
 Breaking Logic into Components: 3
 Test-Driven Development: 2
 Version Control: 3
 Functionality: 2

## D: Professional Skills
I posses strong professional skills as demonstrated by my ability to interact
with classmates and instructors in a professional manner.

### Gear Up
Week 1: Health & Wellness, Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap, and the Week 5 choice session
#### (Health & Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Very valuable to learn about stress and ways to control it during time at Turing.
Was interesting learning about the different types of stress (eustress and
distress).  It was helpful discussing ways to deal with stress such as nature
exposure, exercise, and meditation.  I continue to use the information I learned
in this gear up.


(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Another interesting gear up that brought awareness the gender gap that exists
in the tech world as well as American society.  This gear up taught me to include
everyone, believe people's stories and stand up for everyone's rights.

#### (Tech in Medicine)

I thoroughly enjoyed this gear up as I worked in the health field prior to Turing.
I found it fascinating the technology that has been developed and how it can help
people.  This gear up sparked my interest in health tech and it would be a field
I would consider working in.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended the code demo night at Go Spot Check and partook in the lunch time
workout that's run by the health and wellness posse.
