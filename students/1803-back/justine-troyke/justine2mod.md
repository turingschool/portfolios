# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I wanted to keep a good pace with the curriculum and utilize what were learning to develop
an app that I had been brainstorming in mod1. I was successful in doing so and
it is the project I am most proud of as I learned more on that project than any other and I
completed it from concept to an up and running app by myself. I'm also proud that I entered
it in the code fair in which it was well received and helped me brainstorm new features and
improvements.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Allow outside influences to cause self doubt and effect my performance. I felt very strong in the
first half of the mod, felt like I was tracking extremely well and felt confident in what I knew and was learning
however I allowed lack or feedback or feedback regarding improvement to cause self doubt and underestimate myself. The self doubt really effected my abilities, progress and performance.  
I have learned that I should not let that kind of stuff sit with me, I should seek outside help to find
the specific things I need help with or to improve. I want to stay confident in what I think I know
unless I am told otherwise by a reliable source.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My least favorite projects was Little Shop mostly due to the approach my team took. In hindsight the way
we sectioned the workload didn't allow for maximum learning or exposure to all new concepts we were learning.

  My favorite projects were my mini rails project and Bike Share as they allowed me to use the culmination of everything
I had learned and apply it in a practical way. My mini rails was exciting and fun, I knew what I wanted to do and
got to drive to that point by utilizing everything I had learned as well as practice learning new things on
my own which has vastly improved in ability and speed. I loved Bike Share as it was the smoothest group workflow I
had experienced. Not because we didn't have different thoughts or approaches but we had a great communication and
workflow plan which allowed for us to quickly discuss, plan and execute work. I really enjoyed our initial approach in
which we all had to touch a feature, whether you were the test writer, code implementer or reviewer. Although difficult
to get oriented on what you were doing from one task to the next it forced you to have an excellent working knowledge on
what was happening in all areas of the app.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned that start with less and build to more. Get an excellent foundation and efficient working skeleton to
the app

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  Some thing I learned not to do is ignore a good git workflow and to not shy away from self advocacy for both learning
and design contribution.
Some of the great things I learned was communication tools and practices as well some very handy shortcuts and tactics in
my development tools. I also learned to keep communication open and ask for help when you need it, don't wait to long.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite Gear Up was probably the empathy and privilege one. It was nice to hear from my classmates
on their unique perspectives and get to know them on a different level. I feel like I left that session with a new
found mindfulness that carried on throughout the mod.
  My least favorite was probably the feedback ones, I'm not even sure I remember much about those
and none of my teammates really wanted to the feedback activities as it felt very forced and disingenuous.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
List of contributions:
  -Lead the Health and Wellness Posse
  -Participated in the code fair
  -Guest starred on the Turing podcast... twice(and promoted it on LinkedIn)
  -Paired with Mod 1 students on coding and coping with stress/Turing life
  -Participated and substitute lead the Machine Learning Posse
  -Won a spot as one of the Top 8 Turing Talks
  -Played(and won) in the Staff Vs. Student Basketball game
  -Participated in Aloha Friday with chutzpah.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would love to get more participation in Health and Wellness Posse as well as find a lower mod student who can start taking over to ensure that this stays a part of the Turing community. I would also like to pair more with lower mod students that may be coming from a similar background in order to help them navigate the less obvious struggles one might experience here. I would like to complete my personal project so that students can use it to create meal prep/sharing groups on campus.
