## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
    When I originally came to Turing I was excited about the possibilities of what I would learn and how I would be challenged.
  Unfortunately the challenges were more than I could handle in a 6 week time frame. So this module I wanted to get a firm grasp of the
  simple things and technical ideas so I would have the solid foundation that I needed to be successful for the rest of Turing. I attempted
  to get a deeper understanding of object oriented programming and thoroughly understand the basics of programming languages. I feel confident in
  the leaps and bounds that I have made this mod. Anytime I sit and help another student or explain a piece of code I feel my knowledge solidifying and excited that I can help someone else where I struggled. I know there is plenty to absorb still but I have regained the confidence to jump into that challenge with excitement. I feel hopeful and thrilled about the possibilities that I see for these new skills I am learning. This mod also brought some unexpected developments in other areas of my life and I feel like I can combine that with programming to bring positive contributions to both Turing and any future community I am participate within.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod's projects had their ups and downs for me but overall I am so happy with the progress and deeper understanding I have gained. I have felt a very critical shift of being afraid of the challenges to being excited about them. I actually feel like a developer, of course I know I have lots to learn and a ways to go however, I know that there has been a fundamental shift. I have become very inquisitive about everything in relation to programming and how tech in general either effects or improves things. I have always had a lot fo heart but I am confident that once I master a sufficient foundation of programming I will have my super power.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I gained a lot from the partner projects I participated in this mod and feel like I know where my first areas of improvement should be focused. I enjoyed working with bth partners and had the fortune to experience being the more and less experienced person on each one. I found working styles are very important and need to be discussed in detail to have a successful partnership. Compromise goes a long way.

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/justinetroyke/night_writer_2)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Description:
  The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system. In this project we’ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Evaluation comments:
  Application mostly works
  LOTS of repetitive code
  Some unnecessary methods that don't do anything
  Application does not match the spec
  Runners should be able to use any file.
  Dictionary should be in separate file and use a reverse
  File IO in runners should be pulled out

Feedback to me:
  I found that your work ethic was fantastic. You were also very knowledgable and full of good ideas (especially the way you got the text to wrap around the page: that was     excellent!!). You were always very communicative and I rarely ever felt as though I was not in the know concerning our project progress, as we were consistently messaging each other back and forth to keep our misunderstandings to a minimum. I hope to improve my standard as a communicator to one day match yours.

  One thing I found bemusing was that after the third iteration, you seemed as though you were less enthusiastic about completing the remainder of the project. The Braille to English translator was a component I am certain we could have completed had we worked more before the project was due. We put so much effort into the first three iterations, and we were so close to the finish line. Maybe in the future you could consider moving further along in terms of overall iterations completed. I think it would be a great milestone to set for both you and your future collaborators.

  Your mastery and understanding of Github is also super great, and I wish that I hadn't botched our repository at the last minute. I apologize sincerely for that. Other than that isolated mishap, I think that our partnership was splendid. I can only hope to get the chance to collaborate again with you in the future.

Feedback to me:
  I definitely appreciate your approach to testing and being able to bounce ideas off of you. I also appreciate you being understanding of how I work and allowing me to run ahead of the curve, as that's how I operate best. It's tough to partner with me and I feel like you did very well with allowing me to be me. I think there was a slight lack of communication at times, partly due to my communication style and also due to some missed messages on both of our parts. I could do better with communication as well, so that's definitely a shared critique.

## D: Professional Skills

The sessions I have attended during this mod has caused some amazing and eye opening conversations with new people. I like the interaction I am having with various people who all have their unique outlook. I think previously I wanted to do the lone wolf thing but this mod has really made me flourish and embrace that I work well with people and find it exhilarating to helps others and interact on a regular basis. So much of what I absorbed I have already put into practice with my project partnerships and participation within the Turing community. I look forward to continuing my education at Turing and being the greater developer community.

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I found this session useful in bringing my attention to the different types of stress I was experiencing and which ones I was handling vs the ones I was not. I feel like it motivated me to participate in the greater discussion that was happening at the moment about the health and wellness on campus. It encouraged me to take steps towards managing both my meal planning and exercise on a grander scale and being mindful of intense moments of stress. As a direct result I found that I was able to cope better with extremes and encourage other to remain in control of their well being.   

### Gear Up
#### (Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

I loved this session and feel like it opened my eyes about things going on in the industry I plan to work as well as things happening at Turing. I noticed the subgroup that I was in during this session was the most diverse group I had been in since starting at Turing and that we were most of the minorities in the room. Other things I noticed was that people that identify as women and minorities seem to be among the highest number of repeaters or people who leave the program. It has encouraged me to reach out to other females and minorities to see how I can help and figure out what is causing the gap. This has caused me to be more reflective and proactive on the matter.

#### (Finding Public Data and Using it to Change the World)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1803-inning/Public_Data_To_Change_The_World.md)

I really enjoyed this session and I feel like it opened my eyes to consider other career options that are better suited for my disposition. Previously I always intended to return to the software company I was working for but in a different capacity however now I feel like there are others ways I can be more impactful with my new skills. I learned a lot about public APIs and how to utilize that information in different ways. Currently it has given me resources for a personal project that I wasn't sure how to flesh out but now feel more equipped to tackle.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I tried to greatly help the new incoming mod 1 students with understanding lessons and projects. I also became a leader of the Health and Wellness Posse which included helping to organize meetings. I also lead a lunch time workout class twice a week and a mindfulness session twice a month. I have begun managing the calendar for the posse and advertising what it offers in order to promote wellness on the Turing campus. I am very proud of what I have contributed mostly because several fellow students have expressed how valuable the sessions I have led have been to them, it encourages me to do more.
