# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  My goal for this module was to successfully  finish all the projects and have
  strong knowledge about the lessons we do.In the beginning i struggled with TDD
  a lot, but now coming to end of the mod, i feel pretty confident about TDD and
  all the things we learn in Module 2.

## Blog

  In this blog I have talked about how TDD is helpful when making an app in rails.

## Projects
  Rails mini was my favorite project this mod.Just because I had little bit more
  freedom in terms of features and other requirements.

  I do not have any least favorite project this mod honestly.

  Coming to module 2, I was really scared of group project, but Working in a
  group of three definitely taught me how to communicate with partners, maintain
  a good relationship between partners and at the time finish projects on time.

## Community
  I kinda liked all of the gear ups i wish some of them were a little bit shorter.
  I think  have helped some of the students from mod1 and willing to help more
  in coming days.
