Manoj Panta (M1BackEnd) Portfolio

Since i couldn't make it to mod 2 and repeated, My goal this time was to  put
alot of time into ruby exercises, talking to mentors  and just make myself
better and be ready for mod 2. I feel way more confident this time around and
feel like im making into mod 2 now. I will try my best to keep this momentum
and successfully complete the mod 2.


** A: Individual Work and  Projects**
*1 JungleBeats.
  This project was about singly linked list and basically making functionality
  of array like deleting a node, adding a node etc.

-GitHub URL for JungleBeats : https://github.com/manojpanta/jungle_beat

-Evaluation comments for JungleBeats
  Methods are occasionally too interdependent
  Good use of the begin/rescue technique, but would have liked to seen that
  implemented througout the code.


-Evaluation Scores for JungleBeats
  * Ruby Syntax & Style : 3
  * Breaking Logic into Components : 2
  * Test-Driven Development : 2
  * Functionality : 2
  * Version Control : 3

*2 HTTP_Yeh_You_know_me
  This project was about creating HTTP server, listen to the requests and reply
  according to the requests. It taught me basic idea of how internet works.

-GitHub URL for HTTP : https://github.com/manojpanta/HTTP_Yeh_You_know_me

-Evaluation comments for HTTP:
      commit more frequently and use branches for each iteration or feature

** B: Group Work and Projects**

*1 NightWriter
  In this project we worked on translating english character into brailles and
  brailles into English.


-GitHub URL for NightWriter : https://github.com/manojpanta/night_writer

-Evaluation comments for NightWriter
    * gitignore the coverage
    * Use ARGV[1]/[0] to get command line arguments. Use them for the filenames
    * Make sure to follow the interaction pattern. I should be able to tell it
      which files to read/write
    * Try not to create unnecessary instance variables. The intermidate values
      shouldn't be Ivars.
    * Too many Ivars makes tests harder to read
    * Lots of integration tests. Not enough unit tests
    * Each method should be tested on it's own, including the helpers

-FeedBack from Project Partner

  Manoj was an ideal partner to work with. I really appreciate that he did not
  get frustrated with me, as I don't feel I know as much as him. I also
  appreciate how Manoj took the time to explain processes to me when I asked him
  to explain. Manoj was available when I needed him to be, and we collaborated
  really well together. I would suggest that Manoj not be too hard on himself
  and to stop and take a few breaths and be proud of his accomplishments.
  Manoj seems to really have picked up the concepts of coding very fast. I
  know without a doubt Manoj will be a great programmer, and I learned a lot
  from him during this project.

*2 BlackThursday
  In this project we learned how to handle CSV files and build relationship
  between those files.

-Evaluation comments for BlackThursday
  Some tests for searching are expecting to not find the thing
  Tight coupling is making things harder to test
  Missing some unit tests for attributes. For example, Merchant unit tests

-FeedBack from project partner

  It was a pleasure working with you Manoj. This project was very challenging
  and I learned a lot from working with you. I really appreciate how patient
  you were while we were working together. You never left me behind and
  explained any refactors you made. It was also really fun working with you
  in general. Every time we passed a test on the spec harness I felt our combined
  excitement to keep working even if it was a nice day outside. Also, you taught
  me a lot about manipulating CSV in ruby. I'm thankful you did that and I have
  a feeling that it will benefit me for the rest of my time at Turing. I don't
  have much coaching as far as technical feedback goes. The only thing you
  could improve on is communication. In person you are very easy to communicate
  with.On slack it is a little harder to get in contact with you. This didn't
  really effect the out come of our project but It's something that could
  be improved on. I would only suggest to make it clear when you're
  unavailable to communicate.

** C: Gear Up

  *Mental Health

  This session taught us how to handle work stress to keep moving whenever
  we have alot of work load and other stress about our personal problems.This
  session was for sure was  one of my favourite.

  GitHub URL : https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

  *Code Debugging The Gender Gap

  This session showed us the gap of participation of males and females in the
  computer programming industry. it was interesting to see the  participation
  of womens in the industry is growing everyday

  Github URL : https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md

  *The Value Of Introverts

  This session led by mod 4 is by the best one for me. we saw a ted talk about
  the power of introverts. I didn't realize our schools and work place is
  designed for extroverts. Since i'm not an extrovert it helped me how to fit
  myself in to that kind of environment.


** D: Community Participation
  I have talked to alot of upper mod people  whenever i run into some problems.
  They have helped me alot to make me stronger. In terms of helping others, i
  think i have helped my peers in mod 1 whenever they have problems. i love to
  help people if i could in future too.

** E: Final Review
