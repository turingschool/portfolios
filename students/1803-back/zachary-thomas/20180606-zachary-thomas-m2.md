# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* I set out to become faster and more competant in rails, and in ruby styling in general, I feel like I've really accomplished that, and I hope that was apparent.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I found it difficult this module to understand what the goals were in terms of completion of my first two team based projects. In mod 1 it was very explicit that helping a teammate who might be at a lower skill level is the priority over completion, but in this mod, it seems as though the goal shifted more toward completion, and that was a difficult transition to make. Mostly I wasn't sure if I should be taking on the amount of work which I would feel comfortable with, but which would have made the project fairly imbalanced.

It's about pursuing 'active laziness' through designing a rails generator which could parse a txt file and return an RSpec structure

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* The Rails Mini, and bike share were my favorites. The rails mini because I was eally able to go at my own pace and because I really enjoyed my idea, and bike share because for the first time at turing, I really felt bolstered and helped by my team, and that was wonderful. 
* My least favorite was job-tracker.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* I learnt that I really enjoy being able to set my own pace, and really run with ideas that I have.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* I learnt that having a solid team is extremely important to how much I enjoy pairing. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* The empathy gear up was my favorite, It's always super enlightening and fun to hear other peoples view points and experiences. 
* I don't honestly think that I had a least favorite gear up.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I participated in the ML posse, helped set up the audio for the turing podcast, participated in the code fair, and helped others by pairing as much as I could

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* Next mod I plan on running the ML Posse, and entering into Demo Night
