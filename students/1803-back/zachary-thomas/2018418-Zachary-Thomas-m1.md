# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Entering into this module, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had no experience in any sort of formal coding environments, so at first, my goal was just to push myself as far as I could. Now that I'm beginning to feel more comfortable in this environment, my goal remains the same. More specifically, I want to focus on refining my code styling choices, writing functional, easy to read code, and improving my testing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zdcthomas/Date_Night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

*Use a binary search tree to sort and retrieve a collection of movie scores* 

Notes:

Should be testing all attributes
It's nice to set IVars to nil to be explicit
Remember to test as specifically as possible, i.e. checking tree structure versus just checking return value of insert
Could make tests more rigorous i.e. runing include on full tree versus just a tree with a root
Good refactor of compare_left/right

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

*Construct a basic framework for sending and receiving different kinds of data over a local port*

#### evaluation comments
Notes:
Git flow: would like to see a branch for each iteration
Nested if else statements should be avoided

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zdcthomas/Complete_Me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

*Create an autocomplete feature, to find potential completions to strings using a retrieval tree (trie)*

Notes:

trie_test should be renamed to complete_me_test
could gitignore coverage
Node children would be better as a hash
assert_equal false should be refute
no test for helper methods i.e. delete_parent_nodes

This was a great experience. In addition to the fact that I think you are a very good coder, I was very impressed how you were able to make sense of and implement new and poorly documented frameworks. That is an area I struggle with, and might have abandoned if I were on my own. I'm very glad you were able to do that. I think you give very detailed and accurate explanations of things which is generally very good, but in some situations might be difficult to follow, and perhaps a simplified summary would be more effective. I think we got some good feedback in the eval for areas where we can both improve.


#### Black Thursday

*Manage and integrate multiple databases, providing basic analytic support and data calling.*

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/zdcthomas/black_thursday)



Notes:
Overall pretty good
Working except a couple methods from I5
Good testing
Some opportunities to refactor - replace each with map, break things out to variables

Mike had good feeback which resonated to me, about how methods should be designed to return objects, rather than modify existing objects.

## D: Professional Skills
<!-- 
## Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset is a concept I've encountered before, and it continues to be very important to me. I've often found myself naturally gravitating towards having a fixed mindset. But developing a growth mindset has not only helped me improve how I learn skills, but it has also helped reduce my anxiety surrounding my capabilities. -->


#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Understanding the way we are impacted by stress is, I believe, one of the most important when trying to succeed in environments like Turing. I found the concept of a window of tolerance really helpful. After that session, I began to integrate it into the way I thought about my stress levels, and the way i manage my reactions to stress.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This was a fantastic gear up session, not only because of the breif apperance in the documentary of Grace Hopper, but also because of how well it communicated the benefits of a diverse workplace. I remember the discussion that my group had very well. We talked in depth about how inclusivity is core to creating a more productive and high quality team.
I had a great time.

#### Mindfullness

* [GitHub URL]()

It was very nice to have a peaceful and healthy break, in the middle of a difficult week. I really appreciate the students that lead our gear up, and the way they were able to calmly lead us in stretching and mindfullness meditation.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always tried my very best to be open and available to helping my fellow students when I could. I attended the code fair, took part in community discussions in our cohort retros, and have tried my best to be a responsible member of the community.
