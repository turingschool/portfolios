# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Gain a fundamental understanding of Ruby, object-oriented programming, and
test-driven development. Leaving Mod 1 I am confident that I have accomplished
this.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled a lot with some of the more abstract concepts, such as what is an
'object', inheritance, etc. I learned that a lot of these concepts are initially
difficult to grasp but through repetition you can start to make sense of them.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was probably connect four, it was a lot of fun making an
interactive program that I could show my friends and have them use. My least
favorite was Black Thursday, because it was such a massive leap in difficulty
over our other projects and at times felt overwhelming.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned a lot about the fundamental programming skills such as iteration,
logic, and object interaction.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Paired projects really pushed me to develop my soft skills, such as communication
and planning, and also taught me a lot about git workflow.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to help my fellow classmates out whenever possible, as well as simply
lighten up the mood because as we all know Turing can be a very stress-inducing
environment.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to stay after class more and perhaps tutor some of the Mod 1
students not only to help them but to really cement my current knowledge.
