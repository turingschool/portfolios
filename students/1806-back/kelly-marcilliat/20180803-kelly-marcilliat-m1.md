## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My goals for this mod were to:
 - Learn the fundamentals of Ruby and be able to apply those fundamentals to projects designed to extend that understanding 
 - Prepare myself for Mod2
 - Help establish a cohort culture of cooperation, openness, honesty, and mutual support 
 - Pass Mod1!
 
I do consider myself successful in this mod.  I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of Ruby and how to apply them to project work.  Whether I am truly prepared for Mod2, I cannot know today, but I feel prepared.  I know I had a significant impact on how this cohort came together as a group.  I made a real effort to be completely honest with the group as to why I was repeating and what they could do to be as successful as possible in the mod and in the Turing community.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Simply, my biggest struggle is the pace of the program.  I am 52.  I commute an hour and a quarter twice each day.  The pace, as you well know, is demanding.  It is sometimes difficult to keep up the pace.  What is to learn from that?... That it's a real thing.  I don't expect the program to change for me.  So, I have two choices.  Keep it up and find the reserves somewhere, or leave.  I choose the former.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects were ConnectFour and BlackThursday.  I really liked the algorithmic challenge of CF, and I liked the opportunity to exercise my own design choices.  BlackThursday was a really nice taste of applying my new skills to things I have long dealt with as a business person.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that I have a good sense of design.  I can effectively think through how design choices will impact functionality, and I can employ TDD to implement that design.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

The paired projects are always challenging, because each partner has to depend on the other.  Normally, learning is dependent almost exclusively on individual effort.  I learned a partner who seems unprepared at the beginning can blossom very significantly in just a week.  It was a cool thing to see.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was the final Gear Up on escaping your echo chamber.  I thought the Mod4 leaders did a really nice job, and the conversation was good.  If I have to pick a least favorite, I'll say Health and Wellness.  It doesn't really deserve it, but you asked me to pick.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

From the time my cohort was doing their prework and my fellow repeaters were doing our intermission work, I made an overt effort to establish myself as a person who is willing to: help, listen, coach, and facilitate.  I have received feedback from several of my peers regarding my communications to the incoming cohort and how it helped set them at ease about this heavy undertaking.  I've been very pleased to be able to help incoming students with their coding issues and to be able to support and encourage my fellow repeaters to hang in there and keep their eye on the goal. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Next mod, I want to spend time helping the 1808 students.  I want to help to grow the culture of inclusion that already exists at Turing to help build a comfort level across the age gap.  I don't blame anyone - students, the organization, or anyone else - but the gap does exist.  By making myself as accessible as possible, I hope to help younger people in the community gain confidence and comfort in interacting with people twice their age.  After all, for most, their workplaces will demand it.
