# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to refine my understanding of computer science principles as well as continue to work on implementing those concepts into my code. I was successful, but not as successful as I was hoping. I'm a tough critic of myself so my expectations may be somewhat high.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with nested iterations with hashes. I learned that drawing out the diagram and identifying each piece was extremely valuable.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

All of the projects were enjoyable and difficult. I can't say that I had a favorite or least favorite. They all had unique challenges.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that it is vital to reach out for help when you get stuck. I tend to focus on one thing and being able to step back and explain the problem to someone else often times leads you to figuring it out on your own.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that it is great to have different ideas and viewpoints when trying to tackle a problem. Selecting the best solution from a number of options is very beneficial.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I did my best to help people who were struggling when I could. As I mentioned earlier, just being available for people to explain their problem very often leads to them figuring things out on their own.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to do the same thing, but spend more time doing it. Staying late even when my work is finished.
