# (Jesse Ling) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn how to apply the content presented in Mod 1 and use that to build an actual website that users can visit. I wanted to learn basic Rails and ActiveRecord fundamentals as well as revisit SQL. 

I struggled a lot this mod. In fact, I haven't struggled that much in a very long time. I just wasn't understanding things and before I had a chance to synthesize the information, I was bombarded with more content. I learned that despite what I think I'm capable of, I can do this. I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and gosh darn it, people like me.

Idea box was a challenge for me. I was a bit foggy on some of the topics initially. I used this project as a tool to refine my knowlege of rails. It is a basic application to track user ideas, images, and categories. It also implements authentication and authorization using User models with an elevated role for Admins.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I made an effort to make myself available to not only our cohort, but also Mod 1 students, when any questions arose that I felt comfortable with. I also paired with several mod 1 students to work through some things they were struggling with. I helped to refine my own knowledge of the topics and often learned new things when doing it.
