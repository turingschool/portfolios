## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to learn about rails, styling, and I really wanted to be able to see what I was building online!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think the thing I struggled with the most was trying to sort through all the new information we were being given. 
But it started to click way more around week 5. It was hard trying to balance all the different things we were give (static challenges, cfus,
projects, and obstacle course) but this also got much easier as the mod went on. 
## Blog

Summary (1-3 sentences): This is a blog that compares creative writing to coding. I wish I had spent more time on it because it ended 
up being very fun. I wish I had been able to touch on more aspects like variable naming, more testing, etc. I plan on working on it more.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
I think it would have been more helpful to have time in the class to work on this more often, or maybe have a certain number due
every week. But in general it was helpful. 

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite project was rails mini - It was fun to see what I could do alone and it was nice to work on something I thought of. 

Least favorite - Little Shop, my group sort of fell apart and I wish I knew how to handle it better at that point. Looking back 
I would have done a lot of things differently on this one!

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that I am capable of doing a rails app by myself since this was the first opportunity I got on it. I also felt way more comfortable
with many to many relationships. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to manage workflow and use tools like waffle and to advocate for my needs!

## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I went to diffrent student group meetings like Joan Clark Society etc. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would potentially like to participate in Code Fair.
