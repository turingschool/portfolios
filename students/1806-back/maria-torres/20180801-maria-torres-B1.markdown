(evaluation comments)
Generally looks good!
Would prefer that you have a runner method that uses return values as input for the next method.
Currently you have a structure that feels like a chain (links from one method to the next to the next from directly within the method). This is a very flat structure. Introducing a runner or CEO method would make it so that your structure had more of a hierarchy and would provide better opportunity for abstraction/testing at a unit level.
Again, generally think this looks good!
Would like to see those tests that you have commented out implemented.
Think that having methods that are organized as a chain (as described above) can make testing more difficult.
Creating methods that have a single input and single output (that don't then call to another method) can make unit testing easier.
Because of the structure of your code, each test that you write is going to be an integration test.
Like the commits, and looks like you have a branch.
Would've liked to see a pull request from that branch!

Make sure you put in descriptive notes on your Pull Requests.
One test maybe needs a more descriptive name "Test it translates....?"
Think about refactoring the first_element, second_element, third_element methods into one get_element that takes scanned and index as arguments.

## D: Community Participation
I participated in the student bake off. I tried to make time to meet up with my
cohort outside of class. I voted in the code fair.

### Playing a Part
I tried to help my cohort members when I could, I hope to be able to do more next mod.
