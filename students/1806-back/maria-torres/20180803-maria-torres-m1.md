# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
This module I set out to learn the basics of Ruby and Object Oriented Programming
and how to work on code collaboratively (With group projects and mentors).

I would say I was partly successful. I feel comfortable with some of the basics
of object oriented programming but I feel like I could use practice with some of
the things we learned later in the mod. I would say I was successful with working
in teams.  


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled most with asking for help, though I think I am working past that.
I learned that I should ask for help sooner rather than later.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed credit check and connect four the most, credit check because it was our first project and that was exciting.
Connect Four was difficult for me, but I thought it was neat how we could see it working on our terminal and I also liked
that we could design it, even though that was difficult. I think that sorting cards
was my least favorite, because it was over fourth of July.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that I need to sit down and plan out my approach vs just trying to
jump into it. When we are assigned the projects I feel a lot of anxiety and
tend to just jump and it's not a good way to work for me because I often hit a wall.
I also need to be better about taking breaks while I work on projects.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned that for pair projects I somewhat prefer working alone and coming
back together, vs driving and navigating because I felt like I understood code
better when I was able to write it out myself, but I think I should find a balance
between these two working styles.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I participated in the student bake off. I formed friendships and participated in
activities outside of class. I voted in the code fair.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next module I would like to make time to go to more student organization meetings
like Joan Clarke Society, QueerQoders ,etc.
