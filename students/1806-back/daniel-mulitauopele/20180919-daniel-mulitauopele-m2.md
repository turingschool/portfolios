# Daniel Mulitauopele - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  * I really wanted to push the envelope in terms of giving my best. I think that's been my whole goal for Turing in general, as I've lived most of my life coasting through. If you hadn't been pushed to the limit in Mod 1, Mod 2 will definitely do that for you. The workload was really heavy, and so I think I felt more down on myself in this mod than I did last mod. But that's exactly the type of scenario I needed in order to push myself.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  * I struggled mostly with holding all of this information in my head, and it's hard to keep confidence up when your learning is that way. Looking back now, I see that it came together at the end. But barely, and so I was pretty down most of the way. I think that's something instructors or staff could do more to address.

Summary (1-3 sentences): This blogs compares many to many relationships with networking, and talks a little bit about cross-pollination learning styles.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

* Somewhat helpful? It might have been more helpful if you had checkpoints throughout the mod so it didn't feel like I was rushing it all at the end. Sometimes people need help pacing themselves, because we don't know it'll be important until is is.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* Favorite project was Bike Share, since I felt like I was actually contributing. Least favorite was Little Shop, because I felt completely clueless.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* That my time management is not as good when I don't have other people relying on me. I also got down on myself very quickly and easily.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I'm pretty good at working with groups. I am buoyed by my peers, and I feel more focused.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I feel like I've had many good conversations recently about race and privilege with students, and I feel like those conversations have changed the perspective of my peers. It's hard to do that, but it always feels worthwhile. I've also tried to be active on Twitter and boost Turing's presence in any way that I can.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* Just more leadership probably. I think I still struggle with imposter's syndrome, so I'm just worried people wouldn't find anything I say helpful.

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?
What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?

  * I'm not sure if TAAAP counts as a posse or not, but I will say that my experience with TAAAP has been incredible. I've made connections with more people than I would have, and it genuinely feels like family. Two of my mentors are in TAAAP, and they've been so helpful to me. I'm learning a lot, and I feel like even after Turing, I'll have a great community of people to engage with on the daily.

## Self-Assessment Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Category                     | Score |
| -----------------------------| ----- |
| **Individual Projects**      |   3   |
| **Group Projects**           |   3   |
| **Professional Development** |   4   |
| **Community**                |   4   |
| **Final Written**            |   3   |
| **Final Timed**              |   3   |


## A: End of Module Assessment

I mean, I hope I passed. Although I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't. I really do feel like that curve trend you guys show in the beginning applies, because I don't feel like I started to get it until the very very end.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Not sure what goes here in the intro, but the only individual project we did was the Rails Mini, and I felt like that was the hardest one for me. It was meant to be a voting app, but I couldn't actually get the voting functionality working. The shell of what is needed is there though.

#### (OpenSphere)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/opensphere)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The project was meant to be a voting app, designed to address some of the issues with voter participation that we see today.

In terms of comments received, there were not many as it was just a show and tell. The instructors did ask about what relationships I built into the app, which were hard for me to grasp.

I'd give myself a 6/10 on this project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These are the projects that I worked on with different people.

#### (Little Shop, Job Tracker, Bike Share)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dmeskis/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/bike_share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

I think my performance in these project went better over time. The first project was ok, but we messed with code the day of evaluation and ruined our project. It was a learning experience. Job Tracker was paired, and it helped me understand what it means to take the lead and try to keep morale up when things aren't going so well. Bike Share was all about how to function well on a team with different personalities, and recognizing what makes someone who they are, even if that clashes with your own personality. Despite our initial struggles, the Bike Share project was most successful.

I appreciated the check ins that came with Bike Share. It felt like a real working environment and I felt like it helped keep the morale up, even when the comments were negative. The other projects, I felt like I received the majority of instructor feedback at the end. I don't feel like it was helpful.

I think we got a barely passing grade on Little Shop, and the same for Job Tracker. Bike Share? I'm not sure yet, we will see.
