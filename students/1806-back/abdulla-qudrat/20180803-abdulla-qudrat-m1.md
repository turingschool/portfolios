# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I aimed to understand the basics of speaking ruby and using it for practical applications(games, data-manipulation). I feel like I can leave the module, confident in my ability to perform basic object oriented programming with test driven development.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Projects. From launch, until evals, the projects were very stressful. I learned that not knowing what I am responsible for knowing is okay because
it is an opportunity to be accountable for my success.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I think Black Thursday was a great way to practice what we've learned and understand where the flow of data is going.
Connect Four was my least favorite because it was hard to create something with lack of the structure we grew accustomed to.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that I have impostor syndrome and that I, by default, believe I am incapable of fitting into a role as a programmer.
I learned it was okay to ask for help because we were all struggling together.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I can work well with different types of partners, but it doesn't mean that they can work well with me.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

By attending the great Turing bake off and voting at the code fair.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to participate in running an event.
