# Abdulla Qudrat - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I aimed to learn how to build a fully functioning website app on my own. I wanted to be comfortable working with databases. I also wanted to have a solid understanding of how the internet works and how I can navigate building an app with that knowledge. I feel like I generally accomplished what I set out to accomplish. The area I struggled with is more complex database queries, but I understand that I will get better at that with more practice and time.

## Blog Post
https://medium.com/@aqudrat630/ruby-enumerables-explained-fb94d536db8a

The blog I wrote was inspired by my lightning talk on Ruby enums. I wanted to explain the basic structure in a way that people may understand batter.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course
https://github.com/abdullaqudrat/activerecord-obstacle-course

The AR obstacle course was helpful in making me practice different AR methods. Debugging in pry was misleading since it returns an object, not necessarily information I was intending.

## A: End of Module Assessment
I'm feeling confident that I met expectations with the end of module assessment.

## B: Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Most: BikeShare and Rails mini because I enjoyed building something when I have a sufficient amount of knowledge.
Least: LittleShop and JobShare because I didn't enjoy struggling without feeling like I have a comfortable amount of knowledge.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

That I dont prioritize my own projects over other tasks, but still felt more confident in my knowledge of the material.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Agile workflow with project management tools

### Individual Work & Projects
In mod 2, we we're given 1 week to independently build a web app of our choice, with the instructor's approval. I aimed to implement the fundamentals we we're taught

* Database build and relationships
* RESTful design
* SRP with the Model View Controller
* CRUD functionality
* Authentication
* Authorization

#### (PerfectPlaylist)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abdullaqudrat/perfect_playlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

PerfectPlaylist is a web app designed for registered users to generate a playlist
from songs, then have the playlists upvoted by other registered users. It's meant
to fine tune playlists to make it easier for for DJs and dancers to find playlists
that have works well with most users. I ran out of time before I could implement
users favorites and upvoting. Also wanted to display metrics for the dashboard,
such as "Most commonly occurring songs on favorited playlists".

## C: Group Work & Projects
Each of these projects were assigned with different partners and timeframes for
completion.  

#### (Little Shop)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abdullaqudrat/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

Little shop is a site that shows items by categories and analyzes those items.

This was the intro project for building a web app and was built using Sinatra.
It familiarized me with concepts like databases, ORM, MVC, and routes. Also helped with
understanding workflow with other partners by using Waffle.io as a project
management tool.

Evaluation:

Meets expectations for everything but AR implementation.

needs improvement:

  views called model class methods

  most AR was good but had a few places where Ruby had to crunch some data

#### (Job Tracker)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrewetobin/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

A personal job tracking app

This project was the intro project to Rails. It familiarized me with building a
web app in rails. We built nested routes to implement CRUD for resources that we're
dependent on each other.

Evaluation:

Meets expectations for everything

needs improvement:

  controller, maybe a few too many instance variables

  model tests for all methods

  UI - the dashboard is pretty hard to read.

  Missing links for jobs index sorted by location/interest

#### (Bike Share)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mikecm1141/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

A site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco and allows a user to purchase
bike accessories via an online store.

BikeShare is the project that implemented everything that we learned in mod 2.
I aimed to practice on implementing a cart, namespacing for authorization, sand
ActiveRecord queries.

Evaluation:

Exceeds or meets expectations for everything

needs improvement:

## D: Community Participation
I didn't participate in the community as I intended to, but I did appreciate the
gear up conversations, especially the ones on stress in the tech industry and
privileges. I would like to join a posse next mod and also participate in community
events like the Coding Fair.
