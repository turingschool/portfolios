I appreciate more than anything the time and patience that Andrew displayed when explaining something that was new to me or when he was reviewing concepts that I still needed help with. He was an amazing partner to work with and kept us at a pace that was above our deadline, giving us even more free time to work on what we needed. Like I told Andrew in person, he treated me like a golf course and left me in better shape then the way he found me. What I appreciated the most was the way how he explained github to me and walked me through making a github map in my notebook. I honestly couldn't have been happier with Andrew as a partner, I have learned so much from this first paired project. My coaching feedback is that Andrew you are amazing, but if I had to come up with any constructive feedback it would be to set focus for creating runner methods right from the beginning rather than spending more time that is needed at the end cleaning everything up.
