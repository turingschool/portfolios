## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
First I didn't know what exactly to expect before starting mod 1. I heard the expectations were set high at Turing, so I was a little scared if I would be able to make, but I knew I could accomplish a lot from previous experiences. My goal was to give my best in what was going to be waiting for me. To put the time and effort necessary to succeed. I told my self I will not be working from 9 to 5 or instead from start to finish. I planned on learning everything as good as I could and make sure I stayed hungry and interested. I was thinking best case will be if I made it to mod 2 and didn't needed to repeat. I also was thinking that I will be able to fit in more things in my day. Like working out, taking time to do ruby exercises and learn some extra things. 

I was successful in giving my best and putting the time and efforts necessary. I also think that I succeeded in getting to mod 2 without repeating. There were days where the finish was later then I thought, but I knew I was where I needed to be at those moments and that was a part of the commitment that I promised and expected from myself. I also made sure that I'm learning the new things a good as I could. The time management was not as easy. I had almost no time left to work out and also the ruby exercises I had to struggle to fit them in, because I focused more on the projects and found my practice in there. 


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

At first I struggled on the fact that I was struggling. When I didn't know how to do something I was thinking that must be bad and I felt overwhelmed and started panicking. Soon I understood though that the struggle is part of the learning process and soon I learned to embrace it and not let it get to me. Sometimes a project was hard to solve, but at the end I could solve it and learned new things that way. Overall I didn't struggle to a point where I couldn't anymore and I'm thinking that mod one was actually not too bad.   

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I love every project that I've completed, because that  was my time and efforts that I have put in there and seeing what I could accomplish after starting here with not having any coding experience at all is so fantastic. I love coding and had mostly fun solving all the problems that come with a project, not all the time, but often enough to love it. Black Thursday was the biggest one, but the great feeling after completing it is therefore much bigger, too.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned and practiced a lot during the projects. I also felt that with each project I understood ruby a part more and better. I asked a lot for help at the beginning, when I didn't understand a lot of things yet. Towards the end I became better on solving the problems by myself and I could notice the improvement that has happened during each project. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
My paired projects went both good. I learned more about the people I was working with and felt that Turing encourages one to appreciate the other. The paired projects were also a great practice for the Github related stuff. I also learned different methods and working technics from my partners. 

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I'm interested in the people here and got to know many new great people since I've started at Turing. Some I consider as new friends. I take care of my things to not make anyone else have to do it. Once I've participated in the cooking contest and attended some extra events of Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I don't know yet, how the next mod will look like, but I think there will be some things I can do and attend. I am thinking helping out with the try coding events would be an option to start with.
