## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I committed to give 100% and focus my time on the program. My goal was to learn everything provided as good as I could, meet all expectations and dealines with the aim to make it to the next Mod. 
I think I was successful, because I spent all my time learning and accomplishing all the projects and deliverables and think that I'm very close to the next mod. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with the new tools, like css, html and ActiveRecord. I also struggled a little bit with the language when I was doing the CFUs for example, because it took me longer to express myself in a technical way. I improved in understanding and using css, html and ActiveRecord through the mod and I also learn everyday new vocabulary.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
