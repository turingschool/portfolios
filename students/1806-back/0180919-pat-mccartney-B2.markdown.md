## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?  This mod I set out to have a better homelife to better support my turing experience.  I am improving, just not as quickly as I would like.  My sleep schedule is improving and I am steadily gaining better work habits.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?  My biggest struggle this mod was the transition to Rspec from minitest.  I was extremely comfortable in Minitest, and transitioning to Rspec was difficult.  With continued work with partners on projects, I got a handle on it and have come to enjoy it.

Summary (1-3 sentences):  A basic tutorial touting the benefits of TDD.  It takes a reader through the set up required, writing their first test and making it pass.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?  It would have been if I hadn't left it to the end of the mod.  Also having active record be a more constant aspect of the class would have encouraged us to practice it more.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why? My favorite project was Job Tracker.  Ben and I worked really well together and it was the project where Rspec/capybara finally started to make sense.  My least favorite project was littleshop.  While it was cool to build a store like that after having completed black thursday, sinatra I feel was kind of a foot note on the mod.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
My independent project really alerted to me that I was underconfident in my abilities.  Once I started it (providing I wasn't ill) i fell quickly into the rails workflow.

What did you learn from your paired projects?  My paired projects went well.  I have found that I am better working in person than remotely.  I tend to get more work done being at the same place as the rest of the team with the extra resources there to ask questions.


## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I was available to help out classmates including mod 1 students and tried to answer all of their questions


What would you like to do to contribute next module?  I need to take a more active role in the turing community
