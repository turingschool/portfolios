# Harper Bellows - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to more fully understand passing arguments and passing objects.  Did I accomplish this task? Yes! I feel really feel so much more solid in the core concepts of OOP.  My algorithmic thinking might still need improvement, but it too is much better than last mod.


I still struggle with algorithmic thinking.  Coming from a Liberal Arts background, it's hard for me to think in such black and white terms, but I'm determined to do what I need to do to build this skill.

## Projects

Last mod, Emmie Hayes walked in the the classroom and proclaimed her love for Black Thursday, and I thought she was insane.  But I get it now.  I loved it.  It spoke to me. It was hard, but the ideas around relational data felt really familiar and comforting.  Having run, and helped family members run, small businesses, Black Thursday, being oriented around Business Analytics, was really engaging to me.

Through my independent projects, I was able to better practice time management and breaking project components in to smaller chunks.  Practicing these ideas served me well in Black Thursday.

Oooh child.  Paired projects come in all flavors.  Sometimes you get a dream boat partner like Autumn Martin, and sometimes you the lone wolf like Pat McCartney.  At the end of the day though, the project needs to get finished, no matter the challenge.  Knowing what I know now, though, I might approach the problem of the lone wolf a bit more directly and much sooner.

## Community

Yeah 1806! I love each and every 1806 student.  I felt engaged from the beginning, and I felt like as I was getting as much back as I was giving.

Next module, I need to more actively engage with the "upper tier" students, as relational data can be hard, and we have a bunch of great minds to draw from
