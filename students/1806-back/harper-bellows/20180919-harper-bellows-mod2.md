They are planning to maintain this site themselves (i.e. they will be adding all companies and jobs, and donâ€™t anticipate companies or other users posting/reviewing jobs).)

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(I really, really love this cohort.  I feel like the they lift me up everyday, and so I work hard to do the same for them.  Everyone (everyone!) is so helpful, and ready to help me when I needed.  And in return, everyone is very open to being helped, so when I have the opportunity to help others, they are always ready to work with me.  The Turing community, in general, is also really great.  I've had several positive cross-program interactions, with Front End students patiently helping me to understand that a div tag is actually not the same a p tag!  Upper mod students have also been enormously helpful, and I try to pay their kindness forward to lower mods when I can.  

The Joan Clarke Society has also been a great personal and professional resource for me.  And I LOVE that so many alums come to the meeting each week.  They're helping me understand my place in the larger tech community, and how to be a positive agent of change.)
