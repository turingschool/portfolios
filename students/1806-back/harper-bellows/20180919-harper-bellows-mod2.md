## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to learn as much as I could!  I feel I was very successful. Like most Turing students, I always wish I was an expert, like, right now.  But I think my fundamentals are strong.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with trusting myself.  I've learned over two mods that I'm most definitely a hockey stick learner.  I accumulate information early in the Mod, but I just have to be patient for the larger picture to emerge.  Once I does, I'm able to quickly assemble the pieces and off and running.

Summary (1-3 sentences):

This is just a quick down and dirty for setting up VSCdoe as your text editor.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Enormously helpful!  I do wish, though, that there had been more immediate help with it.  Especially as relates to building a personal process for getting started with writing a query.  I developed, for myself, a story telling technique that helps me get oriented in the data, the problem, and the solution.  But it took some time, and I just wish I had developed this process sooner.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Cannabis Club! This is where the information really started to come together for me.  I was finally seeing all the pieces in their place.   Plus, the becuase I can up with the concept, the project was more relatable to me.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
In addition to the above, I felt like I got a great chance to learn authorization and authentication.  I think it will be valuable to understand how these processes work later on as our personal projects grow in scope.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned so much from my paired projects.  I got super lucky this mod, and was paired with really complimentary personalities, so my learning was vastly improved and accecelerated through each experience.  And personally, I learned to be more open when I was struggling, as I quickly discovered that my group was struggling in the same areas as me.  This allowed us to debug/brainstorm together, which helped me improve my own processes.

## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I really, really love this cohort.  I feel like the they lift me up everyday, and so I work hard to do the same for them.  Everyone (everyone!) is so helpful, and ready to help me when I needed.  And in return, everyone is very open to being helped, so when I have the opportunity to help others, they are always ready to work with me.  The Turing community, in general, is also really great.  I've had several positive cross-program interactions, with Front End students patiently helping me to understand that a div tag is actually not the same a p tag!  Upper mod students have also been enormously helpful, and I try to pay their kindness forward to lower mods when I can.  

The Joan Clarke Society has also been a great personal and professional resource for me.  And I LOVE that so many alums come to the meeting each week.  They're helping me understand my place in the larger tech community, and how to be a positive agent of change.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'm looking forward to JCS again.  And I'm really hoping some new posses will pop up.  

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?
I tried, again, with the Pahlka Posse, but it never got off the ground.  This is sad because I really love learning and talking about civic tech.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?

How has your posse expereince helped you grow as a professional?
