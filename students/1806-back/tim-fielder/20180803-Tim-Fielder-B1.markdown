# Tim Fielder - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I wanted to learn a new programming language and become as fluent as I could
within the six week period. I wanted to increase my coding skills and learn
how to read the code. I also set out intending to learn how the workflow
for a team coding assignment goes. I feel that I've met these goals and will
be continuing to improve upon them.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Honestly I think working in a team was difficult. I found that I struggled to
adjust my communication style to my teammates and express myself effectively.
I'm learning how to hold myself and my teammate accountable in communicating so
that the project succeeds. I'm also learning to reach out when I get stuck. I
did address this struggle this mod and will continue to push myself to do so again.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
They were all cool in their way. My very favorite was probably the Connect Four
project because I was able to use the tools I had learned through the mod and work
at a comfortable pace to finish it. The timed assessments were also difficult,
but stimulating and challenging technically. My least favorite was probably
Night Writer. I felt it didn't exhibit my capabilities with the code and it took
longer to complete than I would have liked.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
Technically in my independent projects I learned much more about logic flow
in my programs and creating code that employs the Single Responsibility
Principle wherever possible.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Technically I learned about File I/O, and creating a database from scratch.
Interpersonally, in paired projects I learned that sometimes I just have to take the lead and
challenge it when someone disagrees and I feel confident in my answers.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I feel that my Lightning Talk on resources for coding was helpful to a number of students.
Earlier in the mod I took some time to help answer questions in the code for a
handful of other students. I try to leave my space better than when I left it.
Further, I try to keep a positive outlook and put a positive spin to make sure
my morale and the team spirit stays positive.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'm excited to do more in terms of sharing in the lightning talks. I also would
like to be more supportive of my fellow students in their presentations of code.
I hope to continue to develop the relationships I've started to help create the
awesome community atmosphere that's been developed within our Mod.
