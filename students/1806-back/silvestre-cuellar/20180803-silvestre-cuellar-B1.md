## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My main goal for this module was to attempt my best in learning as much ruby as
I possibly could. Additionally, I really wanted to establish relationships that
are going to last a lifetime. Making friends here was actually much easier than
expected. My coding has drastically changed throughout the mode for the best.
I feel like i can actually make something functional.



What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think that my biggest struggle in the mode was the learning how the attr_reader
attr_accessor worked. This held me back for a while. I think that after learning
these, I had that "click" moment. I learned that practice makes perfect and just
to continue practicing as much as you can.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I think that my favorite project was Connect, I learned the most from this
project. Least favorite was probably night writer. It was not the actual
project, I just feel that I did not get much out of it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

independent projects forced me to learn the most, I think this is why I really
enjoyed them at least at first. It is very nice when there is a huge project
and you can ask people for help when needed.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that communication is key in any sort of group project.
Additionally, being in grouped projects helped me learn about merge request
and merge conflicts that can happen. COMMUNICATION IS KEY!

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I really enjoy to make people laugh and smile. In my opinion I think
that I was able to establish a connection with most of the people
in my mode. I feel like I helped some people get out of there shell.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would really like to be open to helping anyone but I would really like to
get one specific student and have a mentor/mentee relationship where I can help
and learn (solidify), maybe meet one time per week?
