# Projects
## What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My least favorite was the night_writer project because I was working with a partner and got really down on myself. Comparing myself to others and thats also when I had my first emotional break-down.
My favorite was probably the last 3 projects we got as an "iterator." Only because I felt more confident in completing them.

## What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learnt just how much I didn't know and looking back I see how much I've grown.

## What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learnt not to compare myself to others (easier said than done) because we all are different. Oh, and how much I didn't know.

I do my best to be kind to everyone. To help others in whatever way I can, even if its something as simple as saying hello.
