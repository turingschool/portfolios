## Nick Lindeberg - BEM2 - Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

-Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, ActiveRecord, SQL

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful? At the beginning of the module, I was struggling with HTML and CSS.  Luckily through my projects I was able to successfully style using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  I feel proud of the way our final project looked.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?  I struggled with errors when switching to rails.  I understand how to correct most errors but it will take more time to learn more of the process

# Projects 

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?  My favorite project to work on was Bike Share.  I feel like I really started to understand Rails in this project along with HTML and CSS.  

## Individual Work & Projects

What did you learn from your independent projects?  I learned that I enjoy projects with more structure.  My HTML skills were lacking at the beginning of this project.  It definitely helped me learn the basics.  

#### Active Record Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?  Yes, I definitely learned a lot about ActiveRecord.  I can sometimes confuse SQL with ActiveRecord, so I will continue practicing.  

#### Rails Mini Project

##### Skills Learned:
Design, Heroku Implamentation, Rspec Testing and a better understanding of HTML/CSS with relation to Bootstrap GEM.  


## Group Work & Projects

What did you learn from your paired projects?  I learned how to used managements tools such as GitHub and Waffle.io to keep productivity up.  I learned more git skills and continue to learn more skills as I work on more projects.  

Completed three group projects.  The first in Sintra and the other two in Ruby on Rails

This blog discusses my process in creating an RPG using ruby.  I talk about how I created a battle system within Ruby that people can use in their projects.  I also talk about how I'm going to refactor my code in the future.
