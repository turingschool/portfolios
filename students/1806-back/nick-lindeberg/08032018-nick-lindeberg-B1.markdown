# Nick Lindeberg - M1 BE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I came to Turing to make a positive change in my career goals and my life.
I have never coded before, so I knew that this experience was going to be
difficult.  I was successful in the sense that I've learned so much in such a   
short amount of time.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled the most with the time independent and paired challenges.  I find
that I can generally complete these tasks, with more time.  The time pressure
was definitely meant to give us a sense of urgency.  I learned that even though
I have access to the internet in these challenges, there is something to be said
about consistent practice.   

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was connect four.  I enjoyed making something that I was
able to interact with.  Though I did not complete it to full functionality, I
was very close.  

  It's hard to decide a least favorite project due to the fact that I learned so
much from each of them.  Black Thursday was a monster project and at times was
hard to understand all of the working parts.  I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy
it though.  I would say it was the most challenging and the project that I lost
the most sleep over.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  Early on I learned that it was good to reach out to other students for help.  
I found that asking for the theory behind the method and not the actual syntax
was far more helpful.  Its one thing to learn the syntax, it's a another to
understand why each piece goes where.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  Github became far easier to work with after the first project.  It was great
to have repetition when it came to working with branches and pull requests.  I
also learned that working as a pair was helpful in coming up with new ideas and
new ways to code.  

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I would say that I helped the community by offering to help other students in
my cohort solve problems and talk about theory.  I didn't get to do this as much
as I would have like to.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I am hoping to be able to help the incoming back end students.  I really enjoy
helping people.
