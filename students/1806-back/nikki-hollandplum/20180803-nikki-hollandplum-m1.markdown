## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I was successful in learning new things, approaching my learning with an open mind and becoming more knowledgeable each day. Overall I do not feel successful in this module because I am having to repeat, but I am focusing on the small wins and how I can improve this time around.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with asking for help and pairing with others at first. I learned that it should not be intimidating and will be the most beneficial thing I can do with my time here.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was night writer, because I was able to use things I had learned the most.
My least favorite project was connect four, becuase I was dealing with an injury and completely underestimated my abilities which left me frozen staring at my computer.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned how to ask for help, how to use google effectively and how important it is to work in pry.


What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I need to be more adamant about my voice being heard throughout the project and how to adapt to another persons' working style.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I taught a yoga class for Health and Wellness Posse, I attended jcs meetings, I met with classmates during lunch and after school. I also attended the Significant Others' meetup.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I will be available in the mornings to work with the new cohort on Ruby Exercises and I will be available via slack. I plan on teaching more yoga classes as well.
