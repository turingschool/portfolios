## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * Since this was my second time through module one, I decided to focus on really building my ruby fundamentals and using more enumerators. I think that I was successful. I feel I have a much steadier foundation than I did last week, let alone last mod.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * My biggest struggle was confidence. I was so worried that I would never 'get' ruby and would fail out of the program. I learned that sometimes I underestimate myself and that I need to believe in my code more.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  * My favorite project was Black Thursday. It made sense to me and I could see the real world applications of it.
  * My least favorite project was Connect Four. It made no sense to me, I felt like the whole thing was dragging and I ended up not finishing it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  * I learned that I need to front load the projects more. I know that I have a bit a procrastination problem and I need to work on that.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  * I learned that there are many different styles of coding and that each style has its own benefits and drawbacks. It was really good to work in a paired project and see those different styles because it will be the same when I go to a job.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I tried to make myself available to people that were going through the mod for the first time, whether that was answering questions or letting everyone know that yes, I cried multiple times last mod, and that's ok. All of the repeaters wanted to make this a welcoming place where people wouldn't be afraid of being themselves, and I think we accomplished that.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would like to do more with posses. I didn't go to any this mod because I wanted to concentrate on moving on to mod 2, but I want to be a part of the larger community.
