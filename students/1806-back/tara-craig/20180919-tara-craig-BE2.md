# Tara Craig - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

After repeating mod 1, my goal for mod 2 was to get through on the first try. I wanted to really absorb the material and learn how to make applications. I was also really excited to get into how to manipulate databases.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think I passed, I guess I'll know tomorrow

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Plant Pal - Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/Plant_Pal)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

My rails mini project was Plant Pal. My app allows users to create plants and keep track of their care requirements, sort plants into categories, and make comments about each plant. It had a one-to-many relationship between a plant and its comments, and a many-to-many relationship between plants and categories. This project helped solidify the table relationships for me, as well as how views, controllers, and models work together. I also learned that I am not good at styling.

This project was not evaluated.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Little Shop Redux

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abdullaqudrat/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

Little Shop was our intro project to Mod2, which was built on Sinatra with Ruby and ActiveRecord. It was similar to Black Thursday, except this time we had SQL and activerecord instead of using ruby to find the data.

* Evaluation Scores
  * Feature Completeness
    * Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
  * Views
    * Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)
  * Controller
    * Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring
  * Models
    * Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
  * ActiveRecord
    * Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programmatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used
  * Testing
    * Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels
  * Usability
    * Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready
  * Workflow
    * Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

* Evaluator Comments:
  * views called model class methods
  * most AR was good but had a few places where Ruby had to crunch some data

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

My partner, Mike, and I, built an application to keep track of jobs that a person has applied to or will apply to. The app allows you to create a new job, add it to a company, create a new company, create categories for the jobs, and add comments for a job. All aspects have full CRUD functionality, except for comments which could not be deleted or edited. It built on multiple one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.


* Evaluation Comments

  * 99% coverage
  * 60/70s theme
  * Used waffle for project management

* Evaluation Scores:

  1. Feature Completeness
    * Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
  2. Views
    * Exceeds Expectations: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
  3. Controller
    * Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring
  4. Models
    * Exceeds Expectations: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of ActiveRecord features
  5. ActiveRecord
    * Exceeds Expectations: Best choice ActiveRecord methods are used to solve each problem
  6. Testing
    * Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests all functionality, at multiple levels
  7. Usability
    * Exceeds Expectations: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
  8. Workflow
    * Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/bike_share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

This project was submitted as the Module 2 final for the Backend Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. Designed to teach students fundamental components of Rails, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, and TDD, this project represents the culmination of knowledge for Module 2 students.

* Evaluation comments
  * No testing for several models
  * Inline styling

* Evaluation Scores

1. Feature Completeness
  * Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented and project is deployed
2. Views
  * Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers
3. Controllers
  * Meets Expectations: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer methods that need refactoring
4. Models
  * Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
5. ActiveRecord
  * Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord
6. Testing
  * Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels
7. Usability
  * Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
8. SASS
  * Meets Expectations: Project utilizes SASS but does not harness its unique functionality
8. Workflow
  * Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, peer and instructor code review, rebasing, and a project-management tool.
9. Documentation
  * Meets Expectations: A custom README is present and gives users an guide to the what and how your application
