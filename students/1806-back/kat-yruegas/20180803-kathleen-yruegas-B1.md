## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My goal when I walked into Turing was to be focused and learn as much as I could. Since I quit my job to be here, I view my time at Turing as my new 'job'. I made it a point to arrive early, stay late, and spend every minute I could studying and making sure I understood the material. I believe I was successful. I put in a lot of time and I am benefitting from that now in my understanding of Ruby mechanics. I feel like I have a good grasp of the basics and am proud of the growth I've seen in myself in this area.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Mostly I struggled with anxiety in this module. I'm in an all new environment learning something foreign to me and with every project, I felt very anxious and intimidated by the things I didn't know. I've been able to recognize this though and find ways to mitigate the anxiety. I feel like this is very important given that my whole career in this field, I'll probably be dealing with this exact same situation. I won't know how to do every problem I'm presented with, or maybe I start working in another language, but I need to be confident and know that I have the ability to learn new things and tackle new problems. I have learned a lot of problem-solving skills in mod 1 that I can fall back on which will help with the anxiety.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

As massive and complicated as Black Thursday was, I really enjoyed it. It seemed like this project allowed me to pull together all the things I learned over the past 5 weeks and tie them all together.  I also felt like the complexity helped deepen my knowledge of Ruby mechanics.  I enjoyed working with a more "real-world" problem as well.  

I did not really care for Connect-Four. The game-logic part was very difficult for me and I'm not sure it's a strength of mine. Though if that was a partner project and my partner knew the game logic, I would feel confident in being able to implement code that reflected that logic.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned how to research and ask questions. I also learned that I HAVE to take breaks!!! When working independently, it's way too easy to get in a groove and sit there for 3 hours coding. This was not beneficial though because my mind would get burnt out and then I couldn't produce anymore code, even if I was on a roll! This was especially detrimental when I would be stuck on something. I recognize now that in those times, I need to take a walk or talk to someone about anything NOT code related or project related so my mind could breath and absorb the problem on a different scale.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned about different types of pairing and which kind I like and don't like. I learned that I enjoy collaborating, but I don't necessarily enjoy writing code alongside someone else, as either the driver or navigator.  I appreciate my partner's ideas and thoughts and love seeing other ways to write a method, but it's hard for me to focus on the code and write the code along with someone else. I recognize this as something I can work on as I progress in my career as a developer.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to offer my help as much as possible to my classmates both on their projects and with their Ruby exercises. I felt confident in my general, basic Ruby knowledge and tried to help others as much as I could. I did find this a little difficult when I felt overwhelmed with projects though.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to continue helping others learn content that I have a good grasp on. I'm not sure yet how quickly I'll catch on to Mod 2 stuff (can't tell the future), but I would love to offer help to the new Mod 1 students while they're working through Ruby exercises and if they have project questions. I would love to be a resource for students to come to when they have questions on Ruby content!
