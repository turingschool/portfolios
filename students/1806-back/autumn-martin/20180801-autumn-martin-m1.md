# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I set out to learn a lot about programming, continue building on my passion, and be able to begin to create games. Yes, I have been very successful! I am learning better than ever before, and my interest in the subject motivates me to further look into things that I do not fully understand. I also especially enjoyed making my connect four game!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled most with the timed coding challenge, especially the first time I took it. I learned how helpful it is to hold a growth mindset, and took it on as a challenge to overcome. I am proud of how much I improved with each one after that first one. I also learned to utilize all my resources, by reviewing timed coding challenges afterwords, doing additional practice challenges, asking questions, and meeting with teachers and mentors.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite project was connect four. It was challenging, but I really enjoyed working through the logic and creating my own unique game design.
* Black Thursday is probably my least favorite at first--maybe due to how big it felt at the beginning and my concerns about getting it done in time. However, I grew to like it over time. Overall, there wasn't any project in particular that I did not like.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* I learned how to break a big project down into individual parts, and begin it by building a design. I also learned how to ask questions when I needed to, and to push myself to meet deadlines with a completed project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I learned a lot about how a paired coding project could work. I learned soft skills: teamwork, accommodating different work styles, communicating feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind, and receiving feedback constructively. I learned technical skills: using git and GitHub to contribute code back and fourth between partners, split up parts of the project, and also communicate.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I really liked talking about people's projects with everyone at the code fair! I am a part of the Joan Clarke Society, and have gone to a few of their events. I and a few others started a hackathon posse. I also been supporting other students in my mod by helping when I can, and giving pep talks. Our 1806 backend posse is awesome, and we often hang out together.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

*  I want to go to a demo night! I would also like to get to know other mods better.
