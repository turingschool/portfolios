## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out with a personal vendetta that I also learn enough styling to make my app look decent enough to present. Several of my projects turned out exceptionally.
I also was excited to learn how to make an application that is also hosted up on net. I also desired to understand, and achieved that understanding, of an ideal organization for all the code in my application. I learned a ton about incorporating CRUD, REST, and using a MVC organization. I also learned about retrieving and manipulating data. Overall, it took more time than last mod, but I feel I have a solid understanding of the concepts. I am able to help my peers in my cohort with their code, and have put in a ton of personal work in to each of my projects. My most recent team can especially vouch for me on this.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
90-100 hours of coding each week. It was challenging because it left barely, if any at all, time for my personal obligations at home. But ultimately it was worth it, I still love coding, and I learned a ton. I have learned a lot about my ability to persevere, work hard, and get things done. Over time, I've also learned to be more efficient with my work. I learned to make time limits for my goals, and stick to them. I've also learned to still find time to take care of myself despite a hefty workload, and to give myself the best environment to focus and learn.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Definitely, but I think I would've gotten more out of it faster if we went over each one as a class, then practiced them individually.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My fave was the Rails Mini! I got to work independently, fully design and make a project of my own imagination. I also really got to explore and hone down a lot of learning areas. I also especially liked BikeShare. I felt very proficient at this point in the mod, and also really enjoyed working with my team.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
A ton! I learned to seed data from a csv, CRUD functionality, began learning user/admin authorization/authentication (learned even more in bikeshare).

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned a ton about working with team members who have different working styles. I also learned how to incorporate waffle in a project, and git tools for team work.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I supported the community by assisting my peers in my cohort whenever I could. I also was able to assist a mod 1 student, Aizar, working through some Ruby problems. I also was supported by others in my mod. My cohort is awesome, and we all support each there.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to go to more events in the programming community.

## Self-Assessment Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Category                     | Score |
| -----------------------------| ----- |
| **Individual Projects**      |    4  |
| **Group Projects**           |     4  |
| **Professional Development** |     4  |
| **Community**                |     4  |
| **Final Written**            |     3 |
| **Final Timed**              |     3  |

I'm not great at tests. Going to work on that for mod 3.
