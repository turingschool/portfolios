# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to learn a good foundation of Ruby and OOP design in general. I also was looking to
improve my professional ability to work in groups on technical projects. I feel like I have had
much success these past 6 weeks, and while new challenges have arisen as expected, I am feeling
very confident in my ability to write beginning and intermediate level code.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most at first with explaining my logical thought process in how I
thought about the code and the challenge it was meant to solve. I struggled especially
in my student groups, working in pairs on projects. I learned that I have some work
to do in communicating in general and need to work on slowing down my inner thought
process to explain in a concise and clear way.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects this module were Complete Me and Black Thursday. I liked Complete
Me because of the interesting challenge it provided and I got the chance to work with a
large data set. Black Thursday was enjoyable because it was an easy to digest real-world
challenge.

My least favorite was Connect Four. Simply for the reason that after overcoming a few
technical hurdles, I realized I wasn't really a fan of the game in general. I did still learn
quite a lot from this project and would not mind having to do something similar again.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

That I can be resourceful when I need to be, and learned new ways to ask questions
when I am alone. I learned the most from these with Ruby-specific technical details,
as I am usually not the same in a group when working through a difficult problem.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I can work well with others but I still have a long way to go when it
comes to explaining my logic in thought and using the right words and tone to convey
what I think the solution may be. I also learned that I am becoming a better helper
in groups in teaching or reinforcing concepts that I may have mastered that others
may still be struggling with.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I made sure to stay active in Slack and around school to help out when needed, or just
talk with someone about their time here to make sure they were on the same page as the
rest of us. I have enjoyed helping the next generation of Turing students in the prework
channels for the next incoming module. This has been hugely rewarding.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to help out module 1 back end students as much as possible. The module
ahead of us was very useful in this regard and I wish to show the same respect and
dedication they had.
