## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

The goal I had going into this module was to learn the principles of MVC
design. I also wanted to begin strengthening my knowledge of ActiveRecord and
ORMs in general. Rails, of course, was also something I was interested in learning
to a great extent. I also wanted to further improve my knowledge of Ruby
and my thought process when tackling logical problems.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with ActiveRecord and piecing it together, and struggled a bit
knowing where to throw what app logic where. I definitely improved greatly around week
5 like predicted. I learned the most that some of these concepts are confusing and 
difficult for a while before they finally fall into place.

Summary (1-3 sentences):

In this post, I went over the basics of code formatting. I talked about proper use
of white space, indentation, and some of the tools Ruby gives us to make code
more readable. 

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

It was extremely helpful. I found it a nice thing to work on a little bit week
by week. I will be referencing this for a long time to come.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project this module was my Rails mini. It was fun to design an application
from the ground up of my own choosing. I enjoyed the challenges it created and felt
I learned a lot of non-coding skills from that project, like planning and writing user
stories from scratch.

My least favorite project was the Sinatra app Little Shop. I've had a bit of Rails
experience before this (just playing around with it in module 1) and knew that a lot
of the headache and frustration from Sinatra's bare bones features would be gone once
we got to Rails.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned most how to write out user stories and draw database tables before even
beginning the coding process. I think one of the other biggest things I learned is 
just how valuable user stories are when planning a project. They really helped me
think about what tables my database would need and what columns those tables would need
to complete functionality. I found this process important as adding fields later on
can cause some issues and some extra time spent squashing bugs and refactoring tests.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I think the biggest thing I learned in my paired projects this module was learning
to use project management tools well. I enjoyed using Waffle and the functionality it
gave us by integrating with our repo on GitHub. It helped keep us on track and gave
us sort of a guideline towards something that felt impossibly large to get done in less than 
a week.


## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I love to help and pair with people. This skill has developed greatly over the last
few weeks, even more so than in module 1. I think I learned the most helping others
debug their code and work through they logical thought process. I am always available
on Slack and loved to help people that way too, as working remotely presents its own
challenges.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to spend more time when I can when the modules below, especially on subjects
that I haven't touched on in a while. I feel this will help me in the long run retaining
information and the ways things are done when just working with just Ruby.
