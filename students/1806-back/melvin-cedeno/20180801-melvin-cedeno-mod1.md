Areas of Emphasis
What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
To stretch my imagination in terms of what I was capable of, I woke up every day never bored or dredging what was in store, I was genuinly excited. 
I started wanting to make connections and to understand ruby, it's been on my list for a few years now and I'm happy to be learning something I've been 
wanting to learn about about for abit. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I guess now that I understand things alot more, I guess it comes down to scope, for awahile I was stuck on enumerables mainly because 
I didn't realize I could only call methods on specific classes. Understanding that block variables are how you can sort of communicate 
between classes was a big one. 


Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I loved night writer, paired projects are an opportunity to grow in different ways.

Community
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
This is a tough one, part of my thinks diversity, then I think about the memories Ive created with the cohort, I feel turing contributed
more to my world than I to turing. I felt included and cared about so I tried to pay it forward and tried to support every person I met in some way
shape or form.
