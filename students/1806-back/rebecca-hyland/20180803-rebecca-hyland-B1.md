# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to learn the basics of being a back-end programmer in Ruby, including soft skills like pairing.
I was successful in my goal and enjoyed myself a lot!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled the most with needing to learn another new concept before the previous one was solid, especially when they build upon each other, so, the pace. I learned that actually I can do this a little better than I expected, and in the same vein, I started to learn how much study time it will take me outside of class to solidify my understanding in these situations.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was ConnectFour because we had more freedom to make design decisions, and I got to prove to myself what I could accomplish individually.
My least favorite project was the first one, Credit Check, because I was still in the weeds in terms of technical knowledge and what I produced was not meeting expectations in important areas.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned from my independent projects that it's important to reach out to research sources including other people rather than trying to muscle through an issue indefinitely.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned from my paired projects that we are learning more than how to code, we really need to learn how to code with another person. It's not easy to learn new things at the same time as learning how to work with a new person, but I am sure this is required at Turing because it mirrors what we will do in the workplace.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
One way I contributed to the Turing community was by forming relationships with classmates in my Mod and contributing ideas to retro for our SAB reps and SAB to consider.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next module I would like to be on a student panel for a Try Coding weekend.
