# M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* This module I wanted to learn to build a website using Ruby on Rails, and I accomplished my goal. I am proud to have started building my original app, Friendly, and excited to add more functionality to it in the coming months. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I struggled the most with my identity as a developer. I am happy to say that I am receiving strong guidance from mentors and my classmates in this area. I will continue to develop my identify as a programmer by focusing on the work instead of what other students are doing. When I consciously take this mindset, it works, because I love learning everything about programming and can focus on that.

Summary (1-3 sentences):
* When using Bootstrap, you don't have to sacrifice styling. Make sure you are correctly installing Bootstrap and naming your stylesheets, and you'll see those colors show up on your Rails app. Code snippets from my Rails app included!

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course
[Link to Pull Request](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/activerecord-obstacle-course/pull/21)

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
* Yes, and it helped to complete them with a mentor or classmate. This program will continue to be a helpful study resource.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* Rails Mini was my favorite project because I loved being able to independently identify a problem/need and a tech solution to solve it. My least favorite project was Little Shop because I might have preferred to start the mod with an individual project to get my feet under me more. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* From my independent projects I learned that I do actually get more done working in a group since I was highly motivated by social pressure and expectations. In my independent project I made excellent plans but was a little too easy on myself in the implementation. In the future I can avoid this by setting a tighter schedule and getting a classmate to be my progress accountability partner.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* From my paired projects, I learned that I can trust my group members to solve problems together.

## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* This module I contributed to the Turing community by completing my Friday surveys almost every week and attending Demo Comp and Code Fair.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* Next module I would like to contribute to the community by mentoring a Mod 1 or 2 student.
