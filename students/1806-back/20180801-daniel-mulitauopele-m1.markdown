# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I knew that I wasn't going to be able to know anything, and so I tried to set my expectations low. I wanted to
know enough to graduate from the mod, and feel like I earned it. But I didn't know enough to actually
set any expectations for the module. Looking back though, knowing what I know, I do feel successful about
how this mod went.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I think I struggled the most with having a growth mindset. In the past, I've always viewed
academic success as being associated with being at the top of the class. When I was at
the top of the class, I was successful. And it made me feel good when I was there.
But being here, there was no way I was going to be at the top of the class when I had
no prior coding experience before coming here. And so when that position was impossible for me,
I began to feel dumb. I felt like I didn't deserve to move on since my standard for moving
on was to be at the top of the class. Luckily, I had people help me grow past that.
It's still difficult, but I'm learning to stop comparing myself to other people
and to view my success in relation to my past self!

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* I love paired projects, because it gives me a chance to shore up my weaknesses through someone
else. I'm a strategic person, but that tends to lead me towards thinking about the whole
project, instead of breaking it down one piece at a time. Somehow who has a focus
strength can help me not get overwhelmed and to focus on the little things, and vice versa.
So the paired projects were my favorite. I hated Connect Four, but that was mostly because of
the growth mindset stuff and feeling stupid.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that asking for help is really hard. But it's part of the process.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I feel like I'm really good at them. I have the skills to succeed in those
environments, and so it feels good to do them. However, I've also had really
great partners up to this point.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to help my cohortmates, and I really wanted everyone one in my cohort
to move on. I tried to be encouraging to everybody. In terms of Turing community as
a whole though, not much.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I think as a mod 2 student (hopefully), I think I'll try to be very involved with helping
mod 1 students.
