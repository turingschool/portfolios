## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

In terms of course content, I was not quite sure what to expect. I knew that whatever it was,
it would be a lot of new information/concepts and that I would be hard pressed to process all of it.
Therefore, my goal was to learn the information that we were expected to learn and successfully complete
projects.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

In the middle of the mod, I began to struggle with time management and processing new information.
I began to feel very tired, overwhelmed and that I was not understanding certain, core concepts.
However, in the 4th week or so, I was able to reanimate myself and address the weaknesses in my
understanding.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Favorite project - I found all the projects equally difficult or rather, I struggled
equally with all of them. Therefore, Black Thursday was my favorite project because it was not
only the culmination of all the information from Mod 1, but also I could begin to see how
what we have learned will play out in a real world context.

Least favorite - Sorting cards, as the first project, was particularly stressful. At the time,
I felt quite confused about classes and how they would interact with one another. By the end of the
project, my understanding was closer to being complete, but still incomplete and that felt extremely
frustrating. What is more, I felt that, ironically, I spent so much time on the project that I was
unable to spend time on exercises, which would have furthered my understanding of class interaction.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that I struggle to work truly alone. Even being around one other person helps me to feel
more motivated and capable to confront the work load in front of me.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I do my best thinking out loud to someone else. It is amazing how many issues I solved
simply by speaking about the problem out loud. I also learned that I need a lot of quiet space in order
to work effectively. So that while I benefit significantly from speaking to someone else about planning or
problems, I do not benefit being around other people speaking while I am working.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was an SAB rep and I quite enjoyed the opportunity to be involved in planning activities as well as
meeting people from other mods that I would not have met otherwise.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to be an SAB rep again!
