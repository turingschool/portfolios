-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

 - would like to see more psudo code
 - would like to see developer be more confident.

##### Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

##### JavaScript Style

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

##### Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### Collaboration

3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Weathrly: dealing with API's
React Number-Guesser: practicing basic React skills.

Weathrly was our first project in React, working with a fake API. We displayed the weather based on location and changed the color palette based on the weather for each day.

### Weathrly

* [https://github.com/pescel/Weathrly]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html]()

Our first project using React. Created to understand how to use React with an API. It was a weather app based on location and date.


### Number Guesser (React)

This number-guesser project was done in React to practice the basics of React and to break out components.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

The projects finished this module were meant to improve skills in React, ES6, and SASS. We also introduced enzyme testing into some projects.

### 2DoBox (React)

* [https://github.com/pescel/2DoBox]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot]()

We designed an app that renders tasks to the page on submit using ES6 and SASS.

- great ops to refactor some code
- look into other es6 functions
- major tests

##### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Accessibility

3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

##### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Utilization of es6

3.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

##### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### feedback
Mike Limberg:

I thoroughly enjoyed working with Lauren on 2DoBox. Lauren brings a positive energy to the group and made the first project in Mod 2 a success! She’s approachable, made herself available and was not afraid to speak up when she had an idea on a problem. We were able to agree on things easily and effectively as a team and due to her willingness to work after school and on the weekend, the project ran smoothly from beginning to end. It was a solid team effort!

The only advice I can give is to keep at the code. Practice, ask questions and continue to learn more. From a collaboration standpoint, you’re all set! I’d welcome the opportunity to work with Lauren again on a project. Thanks for helping to kick mod 2 off right!


### Shoot the Breeze

* [https://github.com/pescel/shoot-da-breeze]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html]()

A web application that allows users to live chat with each other by using firebase.

Next Steps - through the morning, look at the differences between the product and the comp with a critical eye - try and make tweaks to get closer/responsive.


 - 'Send' instead of 'Submit' for button
Clear button missing - no button in place
military time instead of am/pm
First and last name with messages
'You are signed in as...' text change
Mobile View

 - no real styling changes for mobile

 - Filter messages wrong size
Sort up and down wrong size and location
Date text is not changed
First and Last instead of just first per message
etc


##### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Component Architecture

[Pending components broken out that are hidding in the application.js]

3 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

##### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

###### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

##### The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

Joshua Small:

Working with Lauren on Shoot the Breeze was a great experience for me, we created a successful project and had fun doing it. She has a very solid grasp on the concepts and if the rare situation came up that she didn't understand, she made it clear that she didn't understand it. I think this is an incredibly important quality to have as a student at Turing and one that I am trying to work on personally. It was nice to work with someone just as, if not more, goofy than myself. This similarity made a normally difficult project whiz by. Overall, Lauren is a very intelligent and creative person and I thoroughly enjoyed working with her. RIP prettyTime().



### Firebae

* [https://github.com/pescel/Daily-Bullet]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html]()

we built a fancy list that is similar to bullet-journaling.

- components were great!
- loved the breaking out of state!
- could use some small refactoring
- tests were good. would like to see more testing of state and the ui.

##### Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Risk Taking and Creativity

##### Feedback
Dan Grund:

Lauren, great job on the styling and aesthetic choices on dailyBullet, I think they ring true to the analog nature of bullet journaling. Good work driving while we assembled the component structure. If I were to suggest an area of improvement, I'd say don't be afraid of making your voice heard. I think every time you contribute, it's a meaningful addition and helps with troubleshooting and growing the project, and every team can use more of that! Thanks for putting in the hours to get this one done, it was a tough one.

Noah Peden:

With most project partners you can’t really tell how competent they are, or what their work ethic is until it’s too late. Lauren is not only incredibly competent, but stuff doesn’t faze her until it’s figured out, and you can tell immediately.  She single handedly figured out like 20 million problems when it came to testing in React. So beyond being intelligent, she was an awesome friend to work with and I basically have zero criticisms. 10/10 would project pair again.


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Micro Aggressions

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md]()

  Although micro-aggressions are sometimes unavoidable, I think it's important to think before you speak and do your best to put yourself in other people's position when it comes to making comments, jokes, or judgements because we never truly know what is going on in someone's life or what they deal with on a daily basis.

#### Journey Mapping

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown]()

Journey mapping is a good resource to use as a form of visual data. The opportunity to interview and speak to two other Turing students from the back-end program was interesting because we were able to find out more about each other and what our processes were like when we came to Turing.

#### Grit

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown]()

We can use grit when we are faced with a challege, whether it's a project or a personal hardship, we can use grit to push through to the very best of our ability and do so with passion.


### Professional Development Workshops
##### Finding Opportunities

This session with Lia and Meg was helpful because we learned how to find the best opportunities for jobs. Instead of using typical job searching websites, they showed us how to look for individual people we would like to hear from instead.

##### Agiles Practices & Project Management (FEE)

When I am working in groups for pojects, it's important to keep in mind some agile practices to keep things running smoothly. We always DTR in a group to make sure everyone is on the same page, and we often will assign a project manager to keep things on track. I think it's nice to leave feedback for our partners at the end of the mod because it makes them feel good about themselves if the feedback is positive, and if there is some constructive criticism it might help them in the future. I have gotten feedback in the past to not be afraid to speak up if I have ideas or thoughts, which I think is useful because I tend to be quiet and introverted. This personality type makes me tend to keep thoughts to myself or go through my thought process alone. It's good to have someone remind me to speak up.

##### Feedback II

Feedback is absolutely important when working in a group. I need to know how my partner is feeling - whether they have any setbacks or frustrations, what their high skills are and what skills they are still working on, and even their attitude and personality. If I have a good understanding of these things I will have a successful partner pairing.

##### Cold Outreach

Although contacting people you don't know can feel awkward, it's an important part of job searching in this industry. It was helpful that Meg and Lia showed us how we can find people's contact information through linkedIn and github.

##### Networking

Now that Lia and Meg helped us set up elevator pitches for ourselves and got us used to talking to strangers during the workshop, I'd like to go to a few networking events over the next mod as well as the break.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

  Chelsea & Lacey - Chelsea and Lacey are a great team. I've always enjoyed going to the Verou Posse and I think they do an incredible job at leading and organizing interesting and fun lessons that are design based. They are always positive and approachable, and I come out of each spike learning something new.

  ### Other Feedback

  Staci McWilliams (1611 FE) :

I have paired with and interacted with Lauren numerous times over the mod. She was always a pleasure to work with. There was one project I remember where my partner and I were stuck, Lauren came over and paired with us to help us get to a resolution. She was so helpful. I would not hesitate to pair with her again in the future. She is patient and great about breaking problems down to find the solution. Thanks Lauren!

### Being a Community Member
  This mod I attended the event to welcome 1611 to Turing. It was nice to meet a few of them and give them some advice from what I had learned. I also paired with some students which was a learning experience for me as well as them.

### Playing a Part

I have enjoyed going to the Friday morning guest speakers, they have been helpful in understanding what life will be like after Turing in this career path as well as being entertaining and interesting subjects.
