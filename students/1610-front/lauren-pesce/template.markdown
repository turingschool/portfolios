-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Progression/Completion: soft 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer. Got a little hung up talking through the math needed.

  Javascript Style: 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components.

  Workflow: 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts.

  Collaboration: 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Designing our own websites to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

#### Personal Website

* [https://github.com/pescel/pescel.github.io]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/personal-site-first-draft.html]()

A personal website for professional use. Used to display my projects and experience.

Although we did not have a final evaluation on our personal sites, I have gotten feedback from designers and instructors. The feedback focused on playing with the placement of elements and finding font pairings that will stand out while staying in good taste.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The four projects finished this module were meant to improve skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as introducing us to testing code and working with others.

#### Number Guesser

* [https://github.com/pescel/number-guesser]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]()

We designed a game that prompts the user to guess a random number.

- JavaScript needed refactoring to break long functions into smaller, separate functions
- There were repeated query selections, when you can assigned the element from the query selection to a variable to use later

UX/UI Expectations: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Fundamental Javascript Style: 2 - Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

I  appreciated your understanding and consideration when it came to timing.  You wrote excellent comments that clarified the code very well- in addition to writing solid javascript for the first time!  It was easy to communicate with you about our code and our goals.  For constructive feedback, don’t be afraid to ask for more from your partner. - Stephanie Andrews

#### (Linked List)

* [https://github.com/pescel/linked-list]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]()

A web application that allows the user to save website links.


Functional Expectations: 2.5 - will fix responsive and wrap up feature.

Fundamental Javascript Style: 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow: 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML Style: 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style: 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Lauren, you were an absolute pleasure to partner with for the Linked List project.  I appreciate that you value the
challenge it presented and the initiative taken in presenting a final product we could both be proud of.  Your dedication in
taking time necessary to complete all phases of the project is commendable.  I feel we produced results through hard work and
research that show a commitment to high-quality work.  I would very much like working with you in the future knowing that you
hold a standard of excellence as your first priority. - Chelle Tuerk


#### IdeaBox

* [https://github.com/pescel/ideaBox]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]()

In this project, we built a website that will save your thoughts/ideas in one place using local storage.

Specific Adherence: 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

HTML Style: 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

CSS Style: 3.5 -- needs a pass to refactor/organizing, overall well organized

Javascript Style: 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow: 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Collaboration: 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

Lauren- Working with you was an awesome experience. You were a hard worker and had no problem spending hours upon hours working on our project. I was impressed by your knowledge and willingness to work. You also were able to identify your weaknesses and work tirelessly to be better. I  hope we can work together again in the future! - Bekah Lundy

#### Frogger

* [https://github.com/pescel/Frogger]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html]()

We designed a game of our choice. Anna and I chose to create Frogger.

Functional Expectations: 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Testing: 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

Javascript Style: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation: The output from JSHint shows…
3 - Five or fewer complaints.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

The rights given to citizens are part of a give/take sort of system. We are given rights that are linked to a responsibility. These rights are meant to keep citizens safe and keep the country running smoothly. Voting is a good example of one of these rights.

#### Introversion vs. Extroversion on Teams

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown]()

It is important to consider the strengths both extroverts and introverts bring to team dynamics. While most of us consider ourselves on one side or the other, it's more accurate to look at introversion and extroversion as a spectrum. When we work in teams, we should consider our teammate's personality types and be empathetic to how they like to work and think. Introverts might need some time alone to process their thoughts by themselves, while extroverts might need much more team discussion time and feedback. There is no right or wrong way to process our thoughts and ideas.

#### Resilience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown]()

As programmers, we need to build up our resilience because we are in a career that is constantly changing and we will always be learning new things and pushing ourselves. In order to build up resilience, I think we need to first take a step back from a situation that seems difficult or overwhelming and identify what is wrong or bad about it. We should make sure we are not making something out of nothing. Next, we should find something positive in the situation if possible. This will help us feel better and give us motivation to move forward. Last, it's important to remind yourself that you're in control of your actions. 




### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding I

This session with Lia was helpful in setting up our LinkedIn accounts correctly and writing a resume that will set us apart from other developers.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Kenia - Although we didn’t work directly this module, I’ve had enough experience with you to know that you are a hard worker and have come a long way since the beginning weeks of this program. I know it took a lot of courage to leave school at MSU and start over with little experience in coding, but your skills have proved that this is the right career choice for you. I’m so proud of you as your friend as well as a fellow Turing student.

  Chelsea & Lacey - You two are truly incredible! I admire your hard work to start your own posse as well as your vast knowledge of design related subjects and understanding of front-end applications. You were both so positive and made the time we spent together enjoyable. The lessons featured in the Verou posse were intriguing and I appreciate your efforts to include back-end students as well. I liked using our personal sites as an ongoing project during meetings because it was something we can always improve on and it's great to get feedback from other students with the same passion for design.

### Being a Community Member



### Playing a Part

I have enjoyed going to the Friday morning guest speakers, they have been helpful in understanding what life will be like after Turing in this career path as well as being entertaining and interesting subjects.
