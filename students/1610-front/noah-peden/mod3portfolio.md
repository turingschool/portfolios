# (Noah Peden) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I set out to learn React Redux and Ember and get better at setting up my apps in a modular way, which I think I did. Most of all though I set out to be better than I was in mod 2, especially at JS fundamentals, and thanks to the awesome obj/array manipulation problems I feel way more comfortable with good ol' array prototype methods. I think Mod 3 has been my most stressful mod, but the one I've enjoyed and felt most comfortable in.  I also did a lot of cold outreach and went to four networking events.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Accessibility
3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.
User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
JavaScript Style
3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Utilization of es6
2.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.
Testing
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
### Feedback

Feedback from Dan: This is the second project I worked with Noah on. He and Mike organized the file structure and dealt with the brunt of the API calls when setting up the project. He works well with app architecture, but, much like myself, could work on testing skills.

Feedback from Mike: I really enjoyed working with Noah. His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into small speed bumps during our time working on redux. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. We would work for long stretches and Noah would help remind me to take a break. the long stretches of coding would cause us to have worse focus and not get much progress. Noah has really been killing it lately and i’m happy to be in class with him

#### (Ultimate UX/UI Challenge)
#### Summary
This project was a two part project where the first week your team made a comp for a fitness app and the second week you traded comps and developed the app in html/css.

Feedback from Stephanie: It was a short and sweet partnership!  Thanks for laying down all of the groundwork for the ux/ui challenge.  Sometimes, getting started can be the most challenging part of a project for me and you immediately saw what needed to be done to get our project up and going!  I really appreciate your attitude,  your humor, and your communication!  I’m glad we were able to work together this module!!

#### (RemEmber)
#### Summary
This project was a Github work flow and learning Ember project where students don't have access to the master branch and can practice the correct way to make PRs while making a to do list in Ember.js.

## Professional Development

### Professional Development Deliverables
Here's my turing portfolio: https://www.turing.io/alumni/noah-peden

Mod 4 Action Plan: https://gist.github.com/noahpeden/a6872467f3da566aecc5de3936424e1e

Flower Exercise: https://gist.github.com/noahpeden/17a16372b6b1111cd097173fc2cb054d

- Went to three networking events and had four different cold outreach meetings. Working on getting a summer internship with Craftsy was the biggest acheivement. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation



### Giving Feedback

Dan - This is the second project that I worked with Dan on, he's able to play in a team very well and is fine doing the tasks handed out to him by the team, but he could use work on styling.

Mike - "Mike was one of the best partners I had. I really felt like our learning curve was about the same and when Mike would grasp a concept before me he was happy to help, and when the same thing happened to me he was able to grasp the concept quickly. He was always willing to get what was needed done, and even when something was super frustrating or difficult he'd just keeping pounding away at it. Mike is an excellent programmer, teammate, and friend. Also he kills it at Redux."

Stephanie - "Stephanie is a quiet, hard worker, who has a hidden talent for over performing and making everything perfect. Her eye for design really came out during this project and the hard work she put in to the calendar really made our app stand out when we presented. She also is great at open and honest feedback while taking others' opinions into consideration. An awesome partner overall."

Lacey Knaff - "Lacey's eye and mind for design and clean code is one of the reasons I asked to pair with her this mod on my personal site. She was honest and helpful with the ideas I came up with for my own site, and helped walk me through what could be some challenges or downfalls. I think she's probably one of those developers who's going to end up getting paid buttloads cause she's basically a UX Designer with the skill set of an experienced Front End Engineer. Overall she was a pleasure to work with."


### Being a Community Member

From Lacey Knaff in 1608 FE: 
Noah is a self-motivated developer who's not afraid to ask for feedback and advice, which are great soft skills to take into the workplace. I had a couple of opportunities to work with Noah on his personal portfolio, and every time I was impressed with his ability to accept critical advice and desire to learn from others. Not only is this an impressive way to approach work and life, but Noah is just a really pleasant person to talk and work with. One piece of advice I have for him would be to go after learning more about design if he thinks it's something he's really interested in. I think every one can gain an eye and ability to design with the correct amount of time and effort. Either way, he's going to be a great addition to any team or company he decides to work with.


### Gear Up
#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [Github URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Diversity is probably one of the most important parts of a succesful company. It can be often undervalued but studies show that the more diversity, the better.


#### (automation)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown))

My takeaway is that automation is ineveitable and can be a scary prospect. But if we are prepared to help the mass unemployed it might actually end up making the world a better place.


#### (basic income)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I strongly agree with UBI, but the challenge is convincing others to see the benefits of it, and honestly I'm not sure what other options there are, kinda like Elon Musk.
