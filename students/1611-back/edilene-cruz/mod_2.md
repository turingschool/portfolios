## B: Individual Work & Projects

I loved that we had several individual projects! Sometimes the learning curve can be too steep and I was able to go back to the tutorial and just do it again to reinforce concepts. I had a blast finally seeing my work resulting to fully functional web applications. Learning Rails truly made me feel like a developer.

#### Mix Master

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/mix_master)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

The Mix Master is a guided tutorial where I've created an app that tracks songs, artists and playlists. I was also able to implement OAuth using Spotify which gave a little glimpse of all that I can add to my future apps. This project helped me get a little bit more used to testing using RSpec, Capybara and FactoryGirl and seeing how they all work seamlessly.

*Ungraded Assignment*

#### Rails Mini Project - GifGenerator

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/mini-project)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

GifGenerator is a fully functioning Rails app and that was the project that closed all the gaps I had for Rails. There was no tutorial telling me what to do and I've decided that I didn't even wanted to use the rails generate method to help me through the steps. By doing this, I've accomplish understanding the error methods and truly remember where every file should live. I struggled to make the GiphyApi working in my project so I used the Giphy gem instead. This was a little frustrating as I know I was probably just missing a small piece of code to make it work as it should.

*Ungraded Assignment*

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following projects helped strengtHen working in groups and respect other's ideas, concepts and individualities.


#### Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

During Bike Share we implemented Ruby, Sinatra and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzed a bike share program in San Francisco. The data used to seed the application was extracted from massive CSV files that gave us a good idea of why you shouldn't continuously drop your table and reseed your app as this will take hours in the real work to accomplish. I've learned that the more time you take creating a good table with the right relationships will save you hours upon hours of trying to fix it.

## Notes:

* Good homepage and styling. First impressions position.
* Navigation throughout site looks pretty good.
* Missing CSS on a specific pages of the site. Will look into it in code review.
* ActiveRecord is generally clean and good use of methods. Some more advanced AR is not quite there.
* Good code structure and organization for a first attempt. A little more refactoring possible but good.
* Tests don't quite hit the mark. The feature tests don't always test desired information like the dynamic content. Also not much use of anything other than "has_content". Model tests don't test custom methods.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* __2: Application has some small missing base functionality__

### 2. ActiveRecord

* __3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.__

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* __3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.__

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* __3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.__

### 5. Testing

* __2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient__

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* __3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.__


#### Little Shop - Education Gives

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TheKaterTot/education_gives)
*   [Heroku URL](https://education-gives.herokuapp.com/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Using Ruby on Rails, Education Gives builds an online donation website where users can donate items to a school in order to improve their education. This project required the use of authentication and authorization methods, securely storing password, creating carts, updating elements and user information, using an image uploading gem, deploying an app to Heroku, improvement of Git workflow and communication between teammates.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The Parable of the Polygons was an interesting way of visually making a case that most people in society like some level of cultural diversity around them without being overpowered by another group. As interesting as it was, there wasn't much time allocated for the talk and specially for such a difficult concept.

### Gear Up
#### The Gender Gap in Technology

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

What a great documentary! It put a great perspective on what it is to a woman in the technology industry and helped me prepare a little bit more to what I may be facing in the future. I admit that I haven't faced any issues in my previous workplaces just for being a woman but I can understand the situations presented and their effects. However, I decided to focus more on the good things presented by the documentary, like the changes some companies are making by bringing more women and the efforts of others to teach an empower women to enter the tech industry. It proved that if there is some effort to make those changes, that they will actually come faster than expected.

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

This gear up was a much needed break from the previous ones. The discussions created by the other gear ups, to some, almost seemed like finger-pointing and blaming the white male for everything but this one was not gender and racially charged making it easier and less stressful to discuss. I have to admit that I didn't even know there were talks to make this happen and I'm definitely unsure of it's efficacy. As someone that had everything handed to me growing up I, oddily enough, firmily believe in hard work and fighting for what you want. But I understand that I'm being shortsighted as I can see that the technological revolution will continue to bring changes and we must quickly adapt to them. I don't have a strong opinion about universal basic income but if _we_ all benefit from it, why not at least talk about it?


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)

Deliverable:

In my group nobody wanted to be the Project Manager. We never assigned one and I'm pretty sure that if someone remembered through the process, we just tucked that thought away. I personally, feel that we took turns checking on each other's progress; however, there was never a person that we could go to for final decisions and problem solving. We pretty much resolved issues as they came up.

The session was great as it provided examples that we could relate and follow in order to obtain success. Unfortunately, without a leader during Bike Share, we failed as group effort didn't prove to be more beneficial in the long run. I learned through the mistakes and failures of this project that I can still move on and learn at least what not to do.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Feedback II & StrengthsFinder

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

The Johari Window exercise was great as the feedback comes from different people but with very similar results. Even though I would like to think that I'm pretty honest about myself and my personality, there are things that will definitely go unnoticed or not accepted about my behavior. In addition to the Johari exercise, it was great to learn to separate what they truly meant to me by using the right-wrong spotting technique.

Deliverable:
  It seems that I incorporated more of my "perceived" feedback than the actual one received from my team members. I was pretty harsh on my "perception" on how things went during my Bike Share project. I noticed that I'm a little bossy and like things done my way but once I noticed I adapt to the situation and dynamic of the team.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

*   [Workshop URL]()
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zu1Bg7iFx-LV80DSiQ7dVZCLX8qAYmvnGSTDYivl0t8/edit)

I personally avoid doing introspective exercises but the Flower exercise was the first time the experience was less painful. I was able to relate on a different way to the questions asked and how I was able to express myself. Even if I didn't want to write down my thoughts, I still couldn't stop thinking about the questions and what they translated to me in the present day, what they meant to me in the past and what I expect my future to be. It was unpretentious and non-judgmental.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Cold Outreach I

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

I have struggled seeking my mentor, not to her fault but mine. I have a hard time asking for help and reaching out to her was not my biggest strength this module. My plan is to continue reaching out to her in subjects that relates to being a women in the tech industry but I would like to reach out to a Turing graduate for the nitty gritty help as I believe that they will have their own experience to properly guide me through the upcoming crazy module 3.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*Alex Fosco -* It's crazy to think that we haven't worked together before! But it came on the right time. Bike Share was so complex and full of new concepts that during the chaos you were just what we needed. You are even-tempered, analytical and non-judgmental and was truly the peacekeeper throughout the week. We could always count on your knowledge and you constantly delivered great code, fully tested without needing refactoring. Please continue letting your hard work and amazing ethics to show through your projects and allow your leadership skills show more often; we could all benefit from good leaders and from someone to reel us back in sometimes. I really hope we work together again.

*Amara Lovato -* I'm so happy we finally worked in a project together!!!! You are so energetic and conscious of making all of us feeling validated making you the perfect choice for Project Manager for the Little Shop project. You did an awesome job keeping us on track and reconciling any issues that came up while being respectful of personalities. I've been fortunate to see you evolving into a great developer and it would love for you to have more fun with newer and unusual codes/methods. This would introduce you to new ways of solving issues, becoming an even more amazing developer. In a community level, your passion to make this world better can be felt through your ethics and acceptance of others. Please continue working hard on making Turing a more inclusive community and exposing us to a multicultural experience.

*Ashley Schauer -* You are extremely talented and it was impressive to see your problem solving skills in action during the Little Shop project. Several times you were able to explain complex concepts in a way that would harness the knowledge I already had and take it to the next level. I'm really happy that I was able to get to know you a little bit more and see your organizational skills at work you as well as your goofy side. Your drive to get things done is admirable and you are such a hard-worker however, I would like to see you relax a little and let others navigate or just show them how to approach a task and let them finish it. I saw how quick you are to finish a task that would have taken me twice longer but then I didn't get to do it. It's not a bad thing, it will just help us get as quick and smart as you. Hopefully. I hope to work with you again in the future. You are honestly someone I admire.

*Brandon Randall -* I made a terrible mistake during our Bike Share project: splitting up the work before we worked as a group more. I definitely missed out on getting to know you more and exchange ideas and code more often. It was great hearing about your life experiences and how they translate to your life changing adventure to programming. I've learned so much about fairness, teamwork and perspective, all by how you handled the issues that occurred during the project. I would love to see you bring your leadership role from team sports into programming, something you said you've heard it before. Don't be afraid to speak up and make sure that the project has a little bit more of your ideas in the future. It will enrich the whole process. I'm sorry that you are taking a quick break but I'm looking forward in seeing you in the next cohort.

*Katy Farmer -* Working on Little Shop with you was simply awesome!! You are knowledgeable and can present different solutions when approaching a problem. I've learned so much from you without feeling that you were holding my hand through the process and I'm thankful for that. You continued to show your knowledge through refactoring and the code was alway so beautiful and approachable. I hope that you continue to always be firm on what you knows it's best for the project in the long run and continue to adapt and mold it to reflect the personalities of all team members. I absolutely loved working with you and I hope that we work together again. You rock!

*Valerie Trudell -* You are impressively determined, strong and so positive. Even in the hardest of time, you kept being enthusiastic and motivated us all to push through to finish as much as we could for our Bike Share project. I'm very happy that you were not afraid of voicing your opinions and visions from the moment the project started. It's very apparent how fascinated you are with programming and how much more you want to learn. I'm excited to see how far your passion will take you. It was a great pleasure working with you and I'm hoping we get paired again in the future!

### Being a Community Member

*Alex Fosco -* Edilene,
I enjoyed finally getting to work on a project with you after spending several modules together. You led the charge on parsing the CSV files which allowed the rest of the groups' features to work. You have incredible drive and it's nice to have a teammate who really cares about trying to make a project the best that it can be. Sometimes you were too ambitious though, and wanted to start implementing extensions before the base functionality was complete. I know they would be cool and we could learn new skills but there was work that had to be complete before we got to extensions and the group agreed that we should finish base functionality first. I also appreciated your commitment to diversifying what you were working on so you got a little bit of practice on a lot of different parts of the project. I'm sure it will enhance your understanding of everything we learned. Thanks for your hard work G!

*Amara Lovato -* Edilene, working with you was so easy and pleasant that I feel that we have done that for all our lives. Your positive and tenacious attitude is extraordinary, you never get scared of challenges but embraced them with excitement. You volunteered for things that you weren’t familiar with to get the most out of the learning experience and worked really hard in spite of any circumstances. I really like your great empathy and will to make things smoother, that are some of the wonderful skills that make you a one-of-a-kind team member. You have lots of energy and that was great for the team in moments of tiredness but sometimes in the excitement to try to solve things and move forward, you had a spike of energy and I feel that it stopped you from thinking in perspective and listen to others suggestions as well as to other to express their ideas. However, when somebody brought it to your attention you acknowledged it and quickly switched to a more relaxed mode. It was a great team experience and I’m thankful that we were assigned to work together because you were very encouraging, supportive and inspiring. Your team work spirit, your interpersonal skills and your strong will to learn will make you a matchless developer and an awesome addition to any company that is so lucky to hire you.

*Brandon Randall -* G!!!
I love your energy! You have the ability to bring people together through non-code related topics. I think that characteristic is vital to creating an enjoyable environment for people. You stand by your ideas, which is needed in high-pressure scenarios. I REALLY wish we could have collaborated more, but perhaps next time when we are experts. That venture should be fun! Lets make it happen because I value your opinion and I think you can generate some really cool ideas, especially in a group setting! Thanks!

*Katy Farmer -* You were a great teammate on Little Shop. You were capable and willing to take on as much work as we would give you, and your solutions were easy to understand and well implemented. You were fun to pair with, and you always had ideas about what to try when we were stuck. I also appreciated how communicative you were throughout the project. I’d like to see you explore more docs and new techniques to further your knowledge and become an even better developer.

*Valerie Trudell -* G, I love the personality that you bring to the table; its not just about work for you and that brings value to the team and I enjoyed having you as a team member. Although we didn't finish our bike share project you put in the effort and that is what is important. During our project we did have some down fall with the database; likely due to our lack of understanding. I'd say in the future to be cautious of what changes you are about to make only for the sake of trying to help someone. Perhaps, becoming more familiar with git and git workflow if you haven't already. Let it be noted that it is your spirit of helping others that got us into that predicament and at the end of the day that's the probably the best reason to have to go through so much trouble. You have a heart of gold and I love that about you.

### Playing a Part

As it is still so fresh to me the crippling emotions of module 1 and being exposed too fast to too many concepts, I've reached out to module 1 students and checked back with them often to see if they needed any help - coding, emotional etc. I have also participated in the Turing Diversity group and we have been working on how to ensure that students know how to seek help while and beyond Turing, and I've participated in the Pahlka posse activities.
