# Edilene da Cruz - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

All I really wanted was to stay afloat. I had a lot of external distractions - as if Turing wasn't of a struggle - but Turing was my safe place, it was where I got to have fun in the most twisted way. Countless times I caught myself telling me that I was only going to code for another 10 minutes and 3 hours later or at 1 in the morning there I was, with the computer in my lap lost in all those lines, running my server, moving pixels to the right.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

By the end of module 2, I felt like a developer and this module just showed that I can get stuck on following little patterns and bugs. Individual projects were a little hard because I didn't have anyone to give me a little nudge a tell me to move on from issues or to just point out that I had an extra space to and that was why my code wasn't working. I truly learn by making mistakes, cause I don't want to be caught in the same error again. Personal projects were exactly that this module, I learned a lot cause the mistakes were very present.  

#### Api Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/api-curious-github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

The project's main goal is to consume an external API and attempt to clone the basic functionality of github. We also needed to complete an OAuth authorization. I'm really proud of how it turned out as I had very little help and was able to implement the project without major issues.

Build a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. As a user, I should be able to:

X Authenticate with my github account
View basic information about my account (profile pic, number of starred repos, followers, following)
View a summary feed of my recent activity (recent commits)
View a summary feed of recent activity from users whom I follow
View a list of organizations I'm a member of
View a list of my repositories
Extensions:

View a list of open pull requests that I have opened
View a list of "@mentions" that I was included in
Create a new repository

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
Product Experience

1. User Experience

3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

#### Self-directed project - Travel Therapy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/travel-therapy)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

With a great desire to travel and run away from problems, Travel Therapy is a project where I can create a trip plan and set out desired things to do. Unfortunately, the project was not fully completed. The desire to travel and run away from problems, are still pretty much alive and I will continue to improve on the project and add aditional features.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I love the structure that a group project creates and getting to know different styles of thinking, programming and approaching a problem. I learn so much with each group project. I don't like disappointing my team and that's why group projects are so important to me, they push me to be a better developer.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

The end goal of this project is to create an API and to perform business analytics. Working with Max Glassie taught me so much about taking your time to analyze a problem instead of trying to solving it by brute force.

#### Cloney Island - Kickstarter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/cloney_island)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)

In this project, we were set out to imitate the functionalities of the website Kickstarter and apply multitenancy permissions. This was the best group experience I've had so far at Turing. I couldn't have asked for a better mix of brains and brauns and a group of so determined members.

Evaluation

Each group is required to do a self assessment using the rubric below and bring it to your evaluation.

You'll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/blob/f902d71e6d86a3fd293a5a24b10705c6c34be755/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/one_elijah_annie_schutte_devin.md)

It was a shame I was not personally in the classroom to discuss this gear up but I read the articles on my own time. It truly opened my eye for the negative side of technology and made me think on how I can be on upside of the trend.

### Gear Up
#### Microaggression

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

As an immigrant latino woman, I really suck at identifying and caring about microaggresions. Well, I can't say that I don't care but that it doesn't carry weight in my personal life as I have better things to worry about. I just tend to move on to "better" things. With that said, I still like hearing about others perspective and personal experiences in order to help protect them and me from them and when feeling brave to educate others in the issues posed by microaggressions. After the gear up, a group of students stayed in the classroom to continue to discuss this subject and it was probably the best discussion I had so far at Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Eric Wahlgren-Sauro: I'm so happy that we were able to work together on a project again. Working in a group project can be sometimes stressful but working with a friend like you makes things easier. I will always appreciate your desire to help me grow and your honesty. Thank you for being such a good friend and for always calling me on my flaws.

To Charlotte Moore: You are a powerhouse!!! You impressed me the first time we paired and you still do. Management skills, problem solving, wit, determination are only a few things I can say about you. Please continue teaching others while being kind and accepting. I know this can sound cheesy but you will become an irreplaceable developer and any company will be lucky to have you on their team.

To Spencer Carter: I actually thought they wouldn't have the guts to pair the loudest students together but they did and it was a blast working with you. Trust yourself that you know what you are doing and you will achieve your goals faster than you realize. Please be less hard on yourself and continue being the loud sassy pants you are.

### Being a Community Member

From Eric Wahlgren-Sauro:
G and I have become good friends at Turing. Consequently, we know each others blind spots. This is a helpful benefit when on a team with people you don't know. She'd feel comfortable to call me on my shit and I could call her on her's. We spent many hours back-to-back solving problems and building features. Working with her reminders me of how far our skills have come since module one.

From Charlotte Moore:
Despite the struggles you faced, I really think you kicked ass on this project. You were able to produce two of the most complex features of the application, and you were always pushing for more work. Your attitude and work ethic is amazing and it really inspired me when I was struggling during this project. The perseverance you showed on this project will be invaluable to you as you move onto a new career. Youâ€™re awesome, keep doing what you do.

From Spencer Carter:
G is a dedicated and enthusiastic team member. She takes her role as a group member seriously, and her extremely cheerful, optimistic spirit inspires those around her. During my time working with her, it was made evident that she deeply cares about the experience of every member in the group, which contributed heavily to the solid foundation that made our group so successful. I only hope that G can have the same confidence in her coding abilities as she does in her persona, as she is both quick-witted and a quick learner. However, that being said, she never fails to ask questions when she is not confident in a topic, and truly listens to and learns from your answer. All in all, G, you bring a huge amount of positive energy to any team, amazing brain power, and I look forward to working with you again

### Playing a Part

  As I repeater, I know how it feels to feel behind and I was always available to talk to some of the repeaters from 1701 back end and also front end. I did my best to keep them from dropping out of the course. Programming is hard and it will take just a little bit of time for things to seems more natural.

  I co-led a spike on how to set up your bash profile.
