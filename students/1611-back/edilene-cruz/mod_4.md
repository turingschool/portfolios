## A: End of Module Assessment




## B: Individual Work & Projects

I love individual projects as it allows me to option to try something different or stay within my comfort zone. This time around I choose to contribute to the Faker gem. The initial ideal was temporarily stashed and will be worked on as a bigger contribution to the Brazilian programming community. I'm hoping to continue to give back all that I got from Turing.

#### Open Source Contribution


* [Faker gem](https://github.com/stympy/faker)
* [Faker Pull Request](https://github.com/stympy/faker/pull/941)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/lessons/contributing_to_open_source)
* [Blog post about experience](https://medium.com/@edilene/contributing-to-an-open-source-project-b7d92b58baf9)

I simply love the Faker gem and all the fun stuff that contributors comes up with adding some fun to tests. I knew I wanted to contribute to it from the moment I heard about open source contribution. My main goal was to make the gem more inclusive to the Brazilian community of developers and to those who would have access to a demoed project. During the process I realized that this would be better achieved by creating a separate gem with the Ruby methods and documentation all in Portuguese so that will be something I will be looking forward in the next year as a side project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I feel that I'm my best when I can bounce back ideas and/or just rubber duckie a concept so I'm always thrilled to work in pairs or groups. In the end, through laughs and cursing I also make a friend.

After 4 days of struggling trying to understand how JavaScript works, Ryan and I were working in creating Quantified Self, a JavaScript

###Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable**

_I know you broke things near the very end of this project and didn't have time to fully fix everything. There are some bugs with keeping track of the calories and creating a new food. Because you communicated this prior to turning the project in, if you spend some time getting everything back to where it is, I'm happy to increase this score._

### Planning and Design

- **2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.**

_The project does not have API documentation to provide someone with the resources/knowledge to use your API._

### Testing

- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**

_Even though you didn't really get to frontend testing, backend tests look solid and robust. Good job_

### HTML/UI

- **4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.**

_Application is styled and easy to use. You structured your html and css in a well-organized way._

### JS syntax and Style

- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

_You did a great job extracting pieces of logic out into individual, smaller functions. Your backend code base looks very clean. Your frontend code base has room for improvement. You have a lot of debuggers, console.log's, and a few functions that live in more than one place. I highly suggest going back and cleaning these things up._

### Git Workflow

- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**

_You're using PR's, but I don't see that you're commenting on each other's PR's or even "approving" all of them. I think this is something you should work on!_

### Project Management

- **2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them**
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

_I don't see most stories estimated or even started in your Pivotal Tracker. I don't see that you're updating the cards and using Pivotal as a project management tool._

#### Capstone Project - MentorSHIP

Working in brownfield was the main goal of the project and the group and I were very excited to work on the Turing's Mentorship app where students can choose mentors based on their gender, expertise, background or even common interests. The project brought tons of surprises and challenges that each member had to overcome but it was a great learning experience on what to expect in the real world. Unfortunately, after learning ReactJS and working on a feature, it didn't get added to the project so I'm hoping to tackle it during my Module 5 inning. On the bright side, what I learned in React, helped me understand JavaScript better. 


### 1. Project Management

*   **3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime**

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   **3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint**

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   **3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.**

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   **3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.**
*3.5 Modified a gem to make it configurable, used React, but didn't fully complete all React features*

### 5. Documentation

*   **3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application**

### 6. Accessibility

*   **3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.**


## D: Professional Skills
