# Brandon Randall - M1 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

<!-- (What did you set out to accomplish this module?) -->

My goals for this module were to be able to comfortably work with iterations, object oriented programming, test-driven development, make git commits, improve on my pairing skills, and know how to pull and push properly from git. Additionally, I wanted to improve on typing accuracy and whiteboarding. Lastly, I wanted to be able to manipulate hashes proficiently and intuitively.
I feel that I have succeeded at meeting these goals for the most part, but I have found many new goals along the way. I still need to work on my focus, especially when working on very frustrating projects.My goals going forward will focus on maintaining my composure through difficult situations, and continuing the hard work that I have put in throughout this module.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandonrandall/jungle_beat.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

The goal of this project was to create a linked list that can make sounds in ruby. The linked list can be accesed by inserting sounds to the front, back or any specific location in between within the array.

#### Assessed By: Beth Sebian

#### Notes:

Finished through i6
Test suite solid, would like to see some more unit testing and edge cases
Some long methods, code readable and clear otherwise
Make sure to clean up comments for next assessment
Driven with until and while loops
Scores:

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

It does not end or tell me I sink a battleship

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


Following are the graded projects that I worked on with a pair in Module One at Turing.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandonrandall/enigma_final)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

The goal of this project was to creat an encryptor file and a decryptor file that both interact with eachother by loading a message from a file or input and then inserting it into an encryptor file that then turns the original message into an encrypted message. The encryption was based on Turing's machine that broke the code of an Enemy during war time. After the message is encrypted, it then is sent to a decryptor file that turns the encrypted message into a decrypted message.

#### Assessed By: Beth Sebian

#### Notes:

Only encrypt works
Style across project pretty strong
Some gaps in testing, in general suite is pretty strong
Solid division of responsibilities across classes and methods

#### 1. Overall Functionality

1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
#### 3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

Ken Lee - Brandon, you have skill at this coding thing. I was impressed with your TDD coding of the Enigma projects and your enthusiasm when it came to solving problems and getting parts working. Any issues or problems we had while on the project are on me. I have to find solutions for my triggers. I have a tendency to shut down when under high stress and that came out during our pairing. I became paranoid that I could not bring up any issues with you on the notion that I may be nagging you. I believe we should have completed the DTR and revisited it more during our project, that way we have a nice road map of how to proceed. My only thing is, please talk more when pairing. I find that to be the biggest part of pairing and it gets to solutions quicker. You can really enlighten us new to coding with what you already know and I know you know a lot. You showed me that every time you ran one of your test.

### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxglassie/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

#### Assessed By: Ilana

1: More than ten complaints


## D: Professional Development
### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

takeaways from the first sessions: learn how to talk about yourself
                        how will your past help your future?
                        who am I? keywords, architect/creative,
                        begin to develop an idea of these things
* I want a sustainable career that is enjoyable and provides opportunities to solve problems that help make the world more efficient; from business logistics to environmental  
takeaways from the second sessions: I need to be visible, transparent and understand who I am as a contributer to the tech community.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
(feedback from me)
I feel a sense of validation now that I have accomplished every goal I set for myself before passing module 1. I feel like i can comfortably work with files in csv format, I can manouver effeciently with hotkeys and a pretty good typing speed, gained a solid understanding of enums and hashes.

### Being a Community Member

Ali Sclerith: Early in the module, Brandon reached out for a social gathering, which I deeply appreciated as I was surrounded by strangers. Since then, he has also reached out for skills support. I appreciate his genuine interest in truly understanding the content, and not just looking for answers. He is a pleasure to work with.

Max Glassie:
Brandon - I feel like you grew a lot in this past week. Youâ€™re a good man who is working hard to improve yourself while juggling significant family responsibilities. This was a tough week for you. When those many responsibilities presented challenges to our partnership in terms of availability over the weekend and I brought those concerns to you, you took ownership, responded to feedback and stepped up. I admire your grit, your dedication to learning, and your willingness to push yourself to make a significant contribution our final deliverable. You responded beautifully when I challenged you to grow intellectually and as a programmer; that growth mindset in the midst of struggle will take you far. Good job.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

To this point, I have spent a lot of time changing my mindset that of a developer and making sure that the level of competence is high enough to move on from mod 1. I think I have been as positive as a person could while being faced with the biggest and most frustrating challenge that I can remember. I feel like I've been there for people when they needed help and I never withheld any info or acted like I didn't want to help anyone which, in turn, resulted in various people approaching me for help in this mod.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
ted talk: the power of believing that you can improve
          the power of "yet"

          The thing that stands out most from these videos is the idea of 'wise praise' which causes heartiness and resiliance. I also realized that I don't have any triggers that will put me into a fixed mindset.

#### Introverts vs Extroverts

takeaways from this:I confirmed that I am almost completely extroverted
                    I was inspired to try new things and frequently do retrospectives

takeaways from the discussions with other extroverts: I think that there is a necessity to improve my overall focus and devotion to accomplishing tasks.

takeaways from introverts: I think that it is necessary for both types to be able to have good communication skills and the ability to get along with others. I also think in regards to projects, it would be helpful to work on some things individually, but Its more effictive to be open minded to talking with others about projects.

what do I need to be at my best?
                    I like to stand or be on a stool opposed to a regular chair.
                    I definately favor pairing in projects

#### GRIT

The most memorable thing about the first article is the qualities of someone with grit and the fact that its difficult to implement into a curriculum. The video made me realize that it comes down to the combination of passion and perseverance and is something that cannot be broken down into a science; it can only be manifested. The most interesting thing from the second article was the importance of the ability to change and grow. What i took from the articles and the video was that all i need is the desire to be able to change and grow from the change while understanding that some failures are to help a person grow.
