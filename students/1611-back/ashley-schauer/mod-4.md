## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted more collaboration practice and I wanted to learn more JavaScript, especially jQuery. I wanted to challenge myself with the open source project so I would find the whole process less intimidating. I wanted to get more brownfield experience and working with an established code base.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income

I really enjoyed this experience. It was fun working collaboratively with others to develop the Gear Up. We talked a lot about what we liked or didn't like about previous sessions and how to maximize our time. We were well organized, everyone in the group got to contribute, and had a lot of fun. I always enjoyed small group discussions, and I had a great group. I tried playing devil's advocate, but it was a nice reversal having to focus on fostering discussion rather than contributing to it.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did a pairing session with one of the Mod 3 students on Yodlee. I completed my Gear Up. I intended to lead a Spike Session, but the schedule was really weird this mod.
