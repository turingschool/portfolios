### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown 
We'll explore the concepts from Parable of the Polygons (PotP) within the context of diversity in tech.

1.  Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available? 
    The jobs will be filled by predominetly the same people that have been running these companies leaving the unskilled or   
    or lesser beneficial jobs for those that aren't like the people who have already "made it". Create a further gap and not  
    creating divircity.

2.  Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
    My attitude is that we are all people and regardless of gender, age, race we can all be interested in the same things     
    like programming. Therefore we need to seek out those individuals who are equally interested and make sure they are able 
    to climb aboard too. Diversity quotas feel disingenious to me because if a company is prodominently male and they have a 
    diversity quotas of at least 10 females than the first 10 females that walk in the door will be hired. It doesn't feel 
    genin and besides that its still evaluating people on a gender level instead of their skills which is what should be the 
    most important.

3.  Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
    PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission. 
     Be okay with divirsity. Be okay with being surronded by people who are not like you at all. And maybe seek out 
     individuals that aren't like you. Like divisiving your trade portfolio. 
    
4.    PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
