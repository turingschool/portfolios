## Areas of Emphasis

First beginning the module I wanted to learn to make running programs, that are complete and mature, accomplishing complex tasks. I set out to show up everyday to class, present and ready to learn. Lastly, I wanted to learn to program the thing I set out to program, and when encountering problems I didn't understand; I would push through them and not just find a way around them.

## Super Fizz Buzz ##

* [GitHub URL] 
  https://github.com/valerietrudell/Sorting_Suite
* [Original Assignment]
  https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/super_fizz.markdown

Description
===============================================================

Super Fizz is, the commonly known interview question, that asks to replace the numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5 with a Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz. This SuperFizz puts a little spin on it. Instead of 100 numbers there are 1000, it adds an additional 7 to the divisible numbers list to be replaced with Super, and when all three occur the goal is to replace the number with SuperFizzBuzz.

* [Original Assignment]
  https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown

Description
===============================================================
Sorting Suite contained three separate sorting requirements: bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. Bubble sort asks to sort given inputs so that inputs are switching place with each other so that the input being switching bubbles all the way up to its proper place. Insertion sort is takes the input and puts it in its proper place. The last was merge sort which took the inputs one by one the sorted side was to the left and unsorted to the right. After the “line” would move up one input, the input was taken and put in its proper place.

  Description
  ===============================================================
  This Date night project imagines that you are a junior developer at Netflix. You're on a team that is developing a list of
  movies for Netflix users called "Suggested for You." Each time movies are added to Netflix, an algorithm determines a score
  of how likely a given user is to enjoy that movie. Scores are integers between 0 and 100; No two movies will get the same
  score. It is your job to take new movies that have been scored, and store them in a Binary Search Tree.

I really appreciated how you pushed me to step back when we were stuck, and offered different perspectives to every problem. Your ability to be calm helped me when I felt frustrated. It was sometimes difficult for you to stay on task when we had been working all day, but I appreciated that you kept a positive attitude. I felt your ability to ask a lot of questions helped us hone in on mistakes and refactor effectively. You were always flexible and easy to work with, which made our project goals feel more attainable.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown

They talked about how having a growth mindset amongst
young students could either set them up to fail or succeed and when posed with an impossible dilemma; the children that are in a fix mind set where failing is not a good thing found it harder to grow, and those with a growth mindset, where failing was more like a learning experience were more capable of growth and not only that they reach levels the fixed mind set kids never would. This resonated with me, because I personally try to always be "contributing to the good", and I think the growth mind set sticks a cord in that, because you don't look at your challenges as obstacles but opportunities, and you don't tell you're self you can't you just try, and I think in the end when you're just trying to make the most of an opportunity you're see life for the most that it could be, and thus life is slightly more beautiful, and that is contributing to the good.  

Personal Stories 
======================================================== 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown

  2. What are the values that drive you?
  3. How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
  4. Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?

  In Groups
  1. How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
  2. Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?
  3. What values are similar/different?
  4. How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?

Grit 
======================================================== 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up.
	•	Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?
	⁃	Battleship was very difficult and it didn’t end well. I came to a peak breaking point during the extension over the break. I couldn’t get things to work; and I just felt like closing my laptop and never opening the project again. If I were to go back, with the intent to apply more grit, I would have push harder and longer to understand and complete. I felt like I didn’t push myself as hard because I felt I knew I was going to fail anyway. 
	•	Is that lens helpful?
	•	 	…yes
	•	Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
	⁃	I have a tendency to push myself. My goals are something like: coming in at 7am, leaving at 9pm, weekends are not break days but push days. To warm up and cool off exercises before and after attempting anything. With just these goals in mind I spend copious hours in front of my computer and often don’t break for hours. I think sometimes it becomes problematic; because I don’t take care of myself. 

Growth mindset is a necessary for grit. Both growth mindset and the concept of grit speak to one's ability to deal with the ego-stripping experience of failure and challenge that accompany learning and growth.
	•	How would you define the distinction between these two? 
      Grit is pushing to complete a thing; growth midset is, even after you've pushed and pushed, and your result is not at  
      or near your intended goal; you don't step back and except it as a failure; you take the experience of not meeting 
      expectations and recognized the areas you need growth in; and continue to grow in those areas going forward.  
	•	How can they work together? 
      When your work is full of grit you're committing yourself completly to the task at hand, even when you feel like
      stoping and excepting failure; and when you have a growth mindset, you except that even though you did put in your all,
      and your outcome doesnot meet your goal you never say to yourself that you failed; its learning the ways that you can
      be better at the thing you attempted
	•	How has your growth mindset impacted your grit in Module 1? 
      Several times I feel like I've hit a wall; there is no more that I can give than I have already given. Having a growth
      mind set reminds me that during those time; more so when those times didn't equate to sucess, I have not failed; I'm
      just not a software developer yet.

Summary

    Really like the message of your summary but there are a lot of “I” statements. You might play with the structure a bit 
    and see if you can rearrange some sentences so that it reads a bit more smoothly. 
    There are some type-o’s as well as words that are frequently repeated that you may want to change. Here is my suggestion-
    I'm a software developer driven by solving problems and creating a better future. I have always wanted to help people and 
    now know how; by creating new technologies to solve complex problems. 
    Give me one more sentence at the end related to teamwork, collaboration and generally expanding on your notion of 
    “working with great people”

Skills

    Follow summary with skills section
    Continue to add to this area outlining your technical specialties (languages, frameworks, testing and tools). Ideally you
    want 12-20 items by the end of the program. 


Projects

    Follow skills with a project section that includes 2-3 of your favorite projects

    Answer the following questions-
        What problem does it solve? 
        What does it allow the user to do? 
        What is the high level overview of the project? 
        What stack is this app built in? 
        If you worked in a group, what was your focus?
    Deploy and repository with clickable web addresses 


Experience

    Follow Projects with Experience
    Title as Experience rather than Employment
    Format should start with title followed by company
    Use bullet points (3-5 per organization) & focus on the value that you brought to the organization rather than the    
    individual tasks performed.
    Turing can fall under experience or education but having it fall under experience brings it closer to the top and ties in 
    with your self identification as a software developer. Titling this category as “experience” rather than work 
    history/employment allows for it to include things aside from paid employment


Education

    Move to the end of the document


LINKEDIN

    You need a picture

    Summary should expand on rather than duplicate your resume summary. Tell us about yourself, your passions and your ambitions in a short paragraph or two. Ok to talk about Turing but don’t make it a focal point.
    You’ll want to add Projects as you complete them, after summary. If working with a team, one team member should create a project link to the code source, give overview and then link team members. 
    Add Turing to Experience with open-ended date (16/06-present) and provide detailed descriptions via paragraph format for each previous employer as well as information on what you’re doing at Turing.
    Keep Turing in Education (IE, put it in Education AND Experience) - in order to connect with other alumni/future students
    Skills-don’t forget to add your tech skills!
