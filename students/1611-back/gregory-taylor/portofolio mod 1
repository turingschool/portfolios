## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Given to Spencer Carter

Thank you for your help on enigma, I really appreciated your willingness
to work long hours on getting the coding correct.  I think you took some
of the harder parts of the project on yourself and we probably should have redistributed
the work once we discovered the actually scope, so it might be helpful in the future to
make sure your partner is aware when the scope broadens and
rework the distribution so that it gets handled equally.  I think you coding
was done very well and I appreciate how accommodating you were of my schedule
and inability to stay after class.  It was a pleasure working with you.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback to me : Partner from headcount turned in feedback,
I have never received it back from instructor.

### Playing a Part

Participated in Armstrong Posse and joined group discussions before and after
wrap up.
