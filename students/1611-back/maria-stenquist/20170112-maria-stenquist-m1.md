# Maria Stenquist - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?) To learn as much as I could absorb (and not have too much stuff leave my brain!). I came to Turing as I had been exposed to working with dev teams, but was rather mystified as to what these 'coders' actually did on the screen. At the beginning of the module, I wrote down (on paper) that I should get used to being uncomfortable and promoting a 'growth mindset', to write lots and lots of code, write lots and lots of things on paper, use resources (classmates, TA's, mentors, Google), and manage a schedule while not neglecting to take care of myself. Also, to gather a big-picture of the Ruby object model and uses of classes, methods, instance variables, data types, and enumerables. Spiral of knowledge: I wrote this down at the beginning, to add nuggets of knowledge on top of one another, and to remember to re-visit topics and solidify key areas. Being an active member of the Turing community. Well, of those things I definitely wrote a lot on paper (nearly two notebooks worth), was pretty uncomfortable a lot of the time, wrote lots of bad code, and got to know quite a few people in the Turing community. I fell short on getting enough sleep and balancing a good 'work-flow' schedule. I enjoyed attending Bezos & Golick talks, listening to other students give informal talks on various tech/coding topics, and connecting with students in my module, as well as upper-mod students. Looking towards the future, I hope to be able to translate some of these Ruby concepts and be able to apply them to real-life challenges/problems in society.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(In the first six weeks at Turing, I worked on two individual projects: Jungle Beats & Mastermind. I learned a ton in both projects. In Jungle Beats we learned how to create and implement a linked list structure to be able to output a melodious tune of sounds to terminal. In Mastermind a REPL was used where a user provides an input of expressions and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results. 

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mariastenquist/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

**Description**
* An exercise building a linked-list that plays a melodious tune of sounds output in terminal.

**Comments**
* I had fun building this project. I think the concept of linked-lists are important to grasp as they can be built on the fly and are very useful in data science applications. 

**Scores**
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mariastenquist/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

**Description**
* A simple game that works using a REPL interface. A pared-down version of the game Mastermind.

**Comments**
* Would like to expand upon this further and refactor in modules, other functionality.
**Scores**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I think the group projects brought together a lot of concepts and exercised a real-world scenario: pair-programming. Working with others has shown me both some strengths/weaknesses I possess, as well as provided a good frame of mind for structuring  work-flow with another person. I think the group projects tested grit, growth-mindset, empathy, and camaraderie that Turing has been teaching through the Gear-Ups, ice-breakers, and general Turing community events. Putting in some long hours showed me that I could dig in and 'do this', although I also learned that diminishing returns after a certain hour definitely kicks in! Time management skills, managing breaks, checking in with my partner frequently were other skills developed (some to a better extent than others). Overall, I think the group projects were a positive experience, and I certainly learned both technical concepts as well as life tidbits from each partner I worked with. 

#### Enigma

### Feedback

Feedback for - Maria Stenquist (from Phyllis Hugunien)

Thank you for all your hard work in the last couple of days to really pull us through
and get our project to the next level.  You constantly checked in with me to make sure
on the same page and even when you wanted to implement a different approach you made sure I understood and agreed.  I can’t blame you for the Github problem, it was mine fair and square.  I do think we needed to take more breaks in between to clear
our heads and perhaps bring some fresh eyes to pry into issues.  I thank you for your patience and understanding.  You taught me so much about what needs to happen to have a successful software project and I hope to follow your lead and take a strong approach to coding.

You were very good about making sure we had a viable DTR we could use as our guide.  We had an originally unfinished one which I was content to leave as is, but you were firm that we needed to go back, finish and refer back as we worked our way through project which was the right thing to do and really helped us as we moved forward through the rough spots.  Our meeting times never suffered because we had put into writing how we mandated we should meet up and work together.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Session: Learning to Pair/DTR

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair

  Learning to work in pairs, or in groups will be a valuable skillset when entering the tech-world and working as a dev. Working in pairs will provide insight into others' work-styles, preferences, working with different text-editors, and learning how to approach problems in a different way. This is applicable both at Turing, and beyond. 

#### Session: Personal Branding Part I
* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)

* [Link to resume](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/mstenquist/F3KSMN1TJ/msresumeturing.pdf)
* [Link to Twitter](https://twitter.com/MariaStenquist)

Being adept at 'selling yourself' and highlighting both your technical skills as well as your interpersonal/soft-skills is itself a key skill to have in the job market. Particularlly when eager to switch industries and when applying for a job with a newly gained skillset. Social Media is increasingly a resource for searching for jobs, particularly Twitter. LinkedIn is a great place to network & cold call as well. On a more localized level, two sites that I think are great for tech-related job posts in Colorado: [Built in Colorado](http://www.builtincolorado.com/) and [New Tech Colorado](http://www.bdnewtech.com/)

Amara Lovato:

Amara, I remember on the first day of class when we were taking a pomodoro break that you looked up with this huge grin on your face. Little did I know just how supportive you would be to me through these hectic first 6 weeks of Turing. I am super grateful for your friendship, mentorship, and encouragement throughout Module 1, and it was great to work with you on drills and exercises over the holiday break. You are always so positive and understanding of others in the cohort, and you certainly are a magnet for positivity and energy: it is contagious to those around you. When others are stressed to the hilt, you know how to relate to that person to calm the stress nerves and provide some comic relief!! You tackle code challenges head on, and know how to use your resources. I have seen tremendous improvement in how you approach organizing code over these weeks, and others in the class recognize this and come to you for assistance--which you gladly give. You often posted comments on Slack to help bring the cohort together, and you always made sure that nobody felt isolated/alone. In a sense you are the 'glue' to the cohort, and I know several of the students are grateful for your initiatives!! Encouraging our cohort as a group will be a valuable skill when facing dev teams, clients, others in the tech field, and peers. I am looking forward to you bringing authentic experiences of people around the world through code :) Un abrazo amiga!!

Ken Lee:

Ken! You have been such an awesome contribution to our cohort! Your dedication to learning the material and sticking with it through the rough parts is admirable. When the going gets tough, you stick with it, and you utilize the resources around you (fellow classmates, mentors, upper-mod-ers). I have really enjoyed working on exercises & challenges with you, especially over the holiday break when Blakement was rather creepy, and it is awesome to watch when you understand a concept and things click! While you enjoy piecing together the big picture in Ruby, you don't hesitate to seek out other learning avenues and asking yourself: What can I learn now to add to my toolbox? You are constantly seeking to improve yourself, and beyond that: you are always willing to help other students and lend an ear when someone is having a hard time. Moreover, you are one of the most approachable people in our cohort, and I can see that people feel at ease when coming to you with both personal and code-related issues. Being such a team-player, I foresee that you will make a great contribution to a dev team, and having those interpersonal soft-skills will serve you well! It's been awesome working with you and I am excited to see what comes next!

Chris Dale:

Chris! I think you are a great addition to our cohort as you always add some comic relief when stress/tensions are running high! It has been lots of fun working on drills with you and really solidifying some of the concepts (there are sooo many, ahhh!). I have seen tremendous improvement from you over these weeks, particularly in the latter part of the cohort. I can see when concepts are starting to stick, and that increases your confidence, and that is enjoyable to witness! When you were making progress on an exercise, your focus and drive to actually learn the concept (not just commit to memory) is commendable, and will serve you well going forward. Keep that inner fire!  You don't hesitate to seek out others in the cohort for support, and I think having a solid support system in the module has been really beneficial specifically to you (but this also applies to others in the cohort, including myself). I was glad to see that I could alleviate some of the pressure when you were struggling, and you also made yourself available and checked in with me often, which I really appreciate!

Andy Wooten:
Andy has been a great resource in the class for me to go to. He is always willing to lend an ear and listen to any topic (personal, code-related, off-topic and fun) and is definitely the 'go-to' listener in the class. He listens without judgement and provides constructive comments to the conversation. Moreover, he is so polite and respectful to everyone in the class, and when I was having a rough moment, he had the wherewithal to take a step back--but he didn't forget and made sure to reach out to me at a later point which showed a great deal of empathy--and that awareness extends to all others' in the cohort.  In addition to being a great team-player in the class, he is always willing to help others with understanding code concepts, and I have seen him dedicate a lot of time to helping others (including myself). Keep being such a supportive Turing member, and I look forward to all the cool app ideas coming to fruition! I look forward to showing you around some pretty epic spots up in the high country of Colorado 😃

Edilene Cruz
G! I remember you giving me some sound advice at the beginning of the Module: do as many of the exercises, drills, projects that I could possibly squeeze in. I didn't realize how big of an undertaking that advice would be! That said, you were so generous with your time with me, as well as others. I remember for the first individual project given, you screenhero'd with me for a few hours on a Saturday, and at that point I felt honored and empowered to be a part of the Turing community. Not only were you helpful with understanding coding concepts, you went out of your way to make sure things were going well with me, and you were very approachable. I love the conversations that we have! I admire your drive for digging in and committing to the "software developer in the making" life. I have seen tremendous growth from you over these some odd weeks, and I think your positive attitude, shift in perspective, and ability to not let your past dictate your future will get you a long, long way towards achieving your goals. That coupled with an openness to learn from others, as well as a willingness to teach others: is gold. You are a true example of what it means to be an inclusive Turing member, and I expect to see great things from you  in Module 2 and beyond! Um grande abraço a você!


### Being a Community Member

**Feedback to me:**

From Amara Lovato:
This is my feedback for you:
Maria, it is such a pleasure to have you in our cohort with your positive attitude and incredible life experiences that made repeating worth it only for the opportunity to have met you. I love the humbleness that you have in spite of all your education and knowledge, I will never forget you saying “Turing is way harder than learning how to fly a plane”, and you really know how to boost other people's self-esteem. Working with you on drills was also a great experience, your collaborative pairing workflow is matchless and I am sure that in the professional scene you will thrive in any team. You definitely have interpersonal skills and connect with people immediately, your listening skills and empathy are fabulous. I also admire your will to always share resources with us. I remember when I mentioned that I might look for a remote job once I finish the program and you stopped working on a project to take all the time in the world to show me right away good sites for that and looking for many more. In addition to that, you are always eager to share with us your contacts in the local tech community and good tips when looking for a job, that is very encouraging and highly appreciated.  You are always very resourceful and generous, I love it. Honestly, since the moment that I met you, I clicked with you because you create a pleasant, familiar and warm vibe that makes everybody happier and chill. To sum up, you are a fantastic classmate, a great friend and you will be a priceless developer for all the qualities that you have. Thanks for being so awesome.

From Andy Wooten:
Maria has been an excellent community member to me throughout the program.  She has been awesome, serving as a sounding board for not only technical problems but also personal stress related to the program. She always maintains a open, nonjudgmental attitude and has always contributed meaningful content to any conversation that we have; also, she showed a great deal of respect to me when a conversation was going a direction I was uncomfortable with.  She played a large part in our cohort remaining cohesive, engaging equally with each member throughout module 1.  Our conversations kept me afloat on several bad days throughout the program.  Maria is a stellar example of the behaviors Turing community member should exhibit, and I was fortunate that we shared a cohort.  Keep being awesome!

From Chris Dale:
I’m not even sure how to describe what you have been able to do for me as well as others. I wanted to say you are a rock, but you have been more than that to us.  The things that make you like a rock are the patience and determination that one usually holds with that title.  However, I think why it is inappropriate to call you this, is because a rock doesn’t come to the ones that need help, it’s quite the opposite.  So I think the word I would strongly use is Friend.

From Ken Lee:
Hey Maria, I'm so happy to be able to write you a peer review! You have been a great cohort partner to me and an example of what hard work and passion looks like. You not only take the time out of your busy day to help me but anyone in our cohort who needs some extra support. You are the first one to take notice and lend a hand. You are an example of what it means to at Turing; a person that is willing to help others succeed, a person who doesn't just think of themselves, a person who has situational awareness of how others are feeling and takes actions to insure we are okay personally and professionally. You have demonstrated your ability to take abstract class lessons and apply it into real working code and willing to share this information by teaching it to anyone who needs it. You have an excellent eye to details and patience to work a problem from beginning to end. You will surely become a software engineer that will be more then a developer but a leader.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

Being a part of Turing Diversity--I am excited to work on initiatives to help provide support those that do not feel they come from backgrounds that are traditionally associated with coding & the tech sector. Furthermore, I hope the Turing Diversity student body group is able to help cut accross lines of class, race, gender, sexual orientation and further promote Turing's inclusive mission. This started in the latter part of the module, and I am eager to be a strong member of this group and see how it develops going forward. 

I have really enjoyed going to the posse talks, the guest speakers, and I think that going to 'imposters lunch' has been really good for me to remember to focus on combining a growth mindset and digging in and believing in myself. Susi (spearheading imposters lunch) is amazing, and such a supportive member of Turing! 

I made myself available to others in our Mod1 cohort. I was always available to lend an ear and be there for students who were struggling on a personal level, or were stressed out with the content/projects. Over the holiday break, there was a core group of people that were in Blakement and I think there was a lot of camaraderie and working with others on drills and really helping each other understand material. On Slack, even late at night I was online and I definitely responded first to the messages from other students that needed to vent, wanted someone to talk to, or wanted to discuss how they were feeling. Mod1 is tough, and I was really glad too see more cohort cohesion in the last couple weeks of the module. I think being there for each other really enhanced the Turing experience for many in the cohort.
