# James Anderson - M4 Portfolio

#### Areas of Emphasis
For Mod 4 I set out to learn Javascript and in so doing, learn how to teach myself a new language/skillset. I was also very intent on preparing for interviews and diving headlong into the job search, which I have done.
#### Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

#### A: End of Module Assessment
### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

_Your filter by unread/read buttons are a little buggy. The “top” and “hot” functionality was intended for your Url Lock box application, not your Hot Reads, but what you have is fine!_

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

_I’d love for you to extract the ordering and limiting logic out of your controller in Hot Reads. Additionally, I’d love for the view not to need to decide which link is “top” or “hot.” In Url Lockbox, I’d love for the view not to need to do “link.read == false” - this could be a method in your Link model. Overall, your Rails style looks good_

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

_Your JS code could use some refactoring, but you’ve done a good job breaking the functionality into functions and organizing your code in files. You have some repetitive code, but that’s okay - you can refactor later! Good work getting the JS functionality down. The filtering by read/unread is a bit wonky so I’d check into that (whenever you have time and if you want to)_

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don’t drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they’re written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

_I’d love to see model tests in your Hot Reads app, but overall, your tests look solid._

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

_The URL and title fields do not clear after creating a link. Your Only Read and Only Unread filter buttons are a little buggy. Overall, the structure and format of both applications looks good._

### 6. Documentation

* 4: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application including a screencast or tutorial
* **3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the applications**
* 2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
* 1: Project has insufficient documentation

_Nice work on the documentation!_

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* **3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.**
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

_Looking good!_

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

*Adding a food is actually reloading the page, other than that food page works well
Small validation error where if I enter the calories I'm allowed to enter a negative amount.
Diaries page looks really good.  I caught a small error where if I add a food to a diary, and then remove it the total calories and remaining calories field are not updated.*

### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- **3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.**
- 2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.
- 1: Team did not design their service.

*Your documentation isn't good, it's great!  Did you create a schema before hand?  If so I would bump this to a 4.*

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**
- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

3.5.  *I appreciate that you wrote some intergration tests that worked!  I am getting one failing tests for one of the integration tests.
Good job on the backend tests!  It is very well tested, the functionality tested is appropriate.  Nice helper function DateHelper for your tests.*

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

*Pretty good UX.  The styling is better than most of the QS apps I've seen.  Would be nice to have a navigation link
back to the home page/diaries page from the foods page.  Adding new foods is below the fold, would be nice if there
was a more user friendly layout.*

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

3.5 *I like the use of object destructuring in a lot of you files.  Good use of ES6 syntax.  I like the experimentation with using some of the knex built it querying language instead of writing raw sql for all your queries. Also you did generally a good job of organizing files.*

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

*I would say your commit messages are clearer than most I've seen.  A recommendation is to have one feature per branch you merge in.
A feature should be something like 'get-all-foods' that is just for one endpoint.  All the commits should be squashed to keep the git history clean.*

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

# C: Open Source Contribution

# D: Feedback and Community Participation

## Gear Up

#### Universal Basic Income

It was a lot of fun to lead a GearUp. Our group was pretty in sync with what we wanted to do which made things easier. Having taught before, it was pretty easy to bang out a lesson plan so we spent much of the second planning session researching what video we wanted to show. I was pleasantly surprised with how receptive and engaged the class was. We managed to get a lot of great conversation out of them both in small groups and as whole. I think it went down pretty well and received some great feedback from Ellen Mary and a few 'thank-you's' from students on the way out, which is always nice.
