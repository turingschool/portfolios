# James Anderson - M3 Portfolio

#### Areas of Emphasis
For Mod 3 I set out to continue building on my ActiveRecord knowlege and get comfortable working with APIs. I have become more comfortable taking on the heavier lifting aspects of group projects and playing the project leader role. I have also tried to focus on improving my testing coverage and learned to commit more often to avoid losing progress.

#### Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

#### A: End of Module Assessment
# Evaluation Criteria
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
## 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
## 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## 3. Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
## 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
## 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

# B: Individual Work & Projects

## APICurious

I've previously voiced my disgust with the way that this "project" was executed and the corresponding spec/rubric.

## Evaluation

You’ll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

## Feature Delivery

### 1. Completion

3: Developer delivered all planned features.

## Technical Quality

### 1. Test-Driven Development

1: Project does not have 70% test coverage

### 2. Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

## Product Experience

### 1. User Experience

3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

# Self Directed Project

This project presented its own challenge in that I was used to be being steered in a certain direction on what to build and what the expectations were. My original idea was scrapped after the first few days when I realized that most of the APIs I wanted to use were defunct, expensive, or in XML format; and quite frankly I thought the idea was somewhat dull. The idea that I landed on seemed valuable and I had high hopes. However, I had to spend the first week studying for the assessment as we hadn't touched APIs in weeks. By the second week of the project my energy levels were low and it became apparent that achieving all of the features I envisioned would not be feasible. However, I think the final product would still be of interest to the people of Boston.

# C: Group Work & Projects

# Rales Engine

This was the first time I had worked with APIs since the giphy miniproject. Once the concept clicked, progress moved fairly quickly. The ActiveRecord/SQL methods were a struggle but well worth it.

# Evaluation

Students: James & Cody

Evaluated by: Ali, Meeka, Sal

## Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

## Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

# Cloney Island

Cloney Island was a pain. Conceptually, it wasn't overwhelming but the amount of content and managing workflow between a larger group of people proved tedious. As project manager, it seemed as though I was constantly putting out fires and coordinating tasks rather than actually writing code for the first few days. Our group was also hamstrung with a member who essentially bowed out of the program halfway through. Nevertheless, we delivered a project that we are proud of.

#  Evaluation

Each group is required to do a self assessment using the rubric below and bring it to your evaluation.

You'll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below
expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

### Completion

**Client Expectations**

*   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
    *   4: Better than expected

**User Experience**

*   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
    *   3: As expected

**Organization**

*   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
    *   3: As expected

### Technical Evaluation

**Git Workflow**

*   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
    *   3: As expected

**Test Quality**

*   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
    *   4: Better than expected

**Code Quality**

*   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
    *   4: Better than expected

**Bonus**

We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

*   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    *   0: No

# E: Feedback and Community Participation


## Being a Community Member
### Friday Spike - Bash, Aliases, & Hotkeys
Charlotte, Eric, Edilene, and myself got together to do a spike regarding bash, aliases, and hotkeys. We met and divvyed up responsibility and each prepared a MD to present. For the hotkeys portion, I put together a list of my favorite and most common keyboard shortcuts and recommended pasting 3-5 per week next to the trackpad to help memorize them. The spike went as well as could be expected with zero attendance.

### Received Feedback
James, I really enjoyed working with you on the Cloney Island project. You were dedicated to the project, and I especially appreciate the quality you put into your code, like the site's messaging system. You were always communicative and organized, and made sure to update the team of our status as we went along. As our project manager, you consistently thought ahead to what problems we might encounter and I think that forethat kept us from having any major issues. You're able to work through problems idepdently, be a communicative collaborator, and keep a project on track to completion. You were an excellent team member, and any group would be lucky to have you on their team. -Courtney Meyerhofer

# Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

This topic drew out a lot of constructive conversation. Hearing other's experiences was astonishing. Raising awareness towards microaggressions definitely helps strengthen the community and I was especially glad that it was hosted within our own cohort as I felt much more comfortable discussing heavy topics with people I know well. 

#### Grit

This GearUp was a complete and utter waste of time as it was the exact same session we did in M1.

#### Automation

This topic was both interesting and terrifying. The videos were very interesting and it was a refreshing change to be led by M4 students. While my group was mostly in agreement on the inevitability of automation for all jobs, we discussed what a sustainable future might look like as different sectors become obsolete.
