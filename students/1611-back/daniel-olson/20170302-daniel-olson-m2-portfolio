## B: Group Work & Projects

#### Bike Share

* https://github.com/blackknight75/bike-share
* https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3.5: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Project/Team Feedback from Courtney
* Dan, I really enjoyed working through the Bike Share project with you. I think your technical strengths from this project were in creating a well-stitched user experience and the MVC structure. The styling you added made our project look professional. You were very communicative about what you were working on and eagerly took on big aspects of our project like pagination, CRUD-ing out routes, and seeding. You also influenced the group positively by teaching back the concepts that you learned and offering help to other group members. In the future, when you are frustrated with code, verify your assumptions about what you've written. Often the reasons you were stuck were small things like test setup. You brought a lot of positive energy and motivation to our group. Your ambition is contagious, and I look forward to working with you in the future.

### Project/Team Feedback to Courtney

* It was so awesome working with you on our first project in mod 2 together. Your organization skills are amazing. You kept us on track and made material to help track our progress. This was such a big help for me as I was trying to understand active record and I can't imagine the pressure you must have felt when you were also trying to learn this new database stuff. I would like to see you open up more when your team reaches out to you for help. Towards the end we were all stressed out and I felt like we communicated a lot less as we were making the final push for completion. You have amazing teaching skills and I would like to see you use them more even when you are stressed. Thank you for your patience and understanding and I look forward to working with you again.

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.  

### Tragedy of the Commons
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown

* I found this topic to be intriguing. The effects of diversity on groups was interesting to see visually. I feel like the
site we looked at was a little distracting because it was so well made and interactive. The material was a little difficult for me to follow but my big
takeaway is that diversity breeds creativity. This will translate into better applications because we have creative implementations from a diverse
set of developers from all walks of life.

### Bridging the Gender Gap
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

* I have some big issues with how this topic was presented to us. This was the second time I have seen this documentary and I found it
to be extremely biased and one sided. It was hard to engage with the topic when the material used made me feel so disgusting about my self
even though I haven't participated in these actions. The story about the hoola hooping girls in front of group of guys was a horrible example to
put into this move because the girls doing the dancing were just as guilty as the gentleman participating in it. On the other hand, the story about
the woman that was physically threatened and had her address posted on Twitter was appalling. I condone this type of action and wish her the best of luck.
The other thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that they didn't give action steps. It just felt like they said, "here is a problem and here
are the people that caused it"... and then credits. I feel like if they balanced the conversation a little more we could have a constructive conversation
on this topic. I was approached after the session by a female student who also did not agree with the way the content was presented. This session needs
a major overhaul to achieve the conversation that this topic deserves.

### Universal Base Income
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

* This topic really felt like a throw away session. It was such a far fetched topic and no one in our group felt that this was relevant to our current
state and felt more like a band-aid to fix a larger problem that no one wants to put some thought into. The idea that anyone can get paid for doing nothing
and the implications that come with this is very bad. We have created more jobs since the industrial revolution. This will be no different. Innovation will
always win over handouts.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Collaborative Communication
* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md

* I feel like our bike share group communicated very well. We all recognized each others strengths and weaknesses and we allocated resources
effectively to keep our progress on track. We had some points towards the end were we did shut down communication a little but I chalk that
up as stress in the moment. We did very well on our evaluation and I feel that is a reflection of how well we did work together.
Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

#### Johari Window
* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md

* This was an awesome activity that helped us see what we are doing that other people notice as well as what we don't see in ourselves. Getting together in
our groups and reflecting on these blind spots and where we are strong was very engaging and  enriching. I would have liked a more in depth activity to go farther with this data. This would make a cool application we could use from mod 1-4. Every mod we could take the survey and we could see change over time.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### Andrew Wooten
* Of all the people in our cohort, you helped me stay grounded when I got stuck or frustrated. Your willingness to reach out and check-in with me is your best trait. I always knew that I could lean on you if I had to vent or if we needed to go for a walk you were always willing. Seeing you progress through this program has been an inspiration. The way you communicate with people makes you so easy to talk to. You always listen to understand and I and everyone else appreciate that about you. Als, your lightning talk on communication was awesome!!! Keep it up Andy. You got this!!!

### Being a Community Member

### Andrew Wooten
* Dan O! You've helped to make Mod 2 an amazing experience. I greatly
  appreciate the humor and level-headedness you bring to our cohort. You're a
  source of near-constant relief from the stress that the course load places on
  us. I also respect how you reach out for help; that's something that I struggle
  with a good bit. I've noticed in the past few weeks that you've been more
  hesitant to ask questions during class. For the rest of Turing, please don't
  hesitate. If you have the question, chances are at least half of us do. Your
  question-asking helps everyone learn and by no means hinders it. I'm excited
  to go through Mod 3 with you in our cohort. We're gonna have a great time.

### Playing a Part

* Organized the pairing schedule for mod 1.
* Taught Friday classes for mod 1 to help understanding of class topics
