## B: Individual Work & Projects

Overall I think I did only OK on the projects. I was unable to finish them and I was very nervous about doing anything alone. I always needed help or some kind of direction. However, I did always walk out of the project evaluations feeling much better about them than I did going in. The work that I was able to acomplish was good. 

JUNGLE BEATS

Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

BATTLESHIP

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/baileyward/battleship
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

The Battleship project was teaching us how to build a grid and then us that grid to place random markers on them and have it also be interctive.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

12 tests, all passing
Random placement of ships doesnt work, but game is functional.
Code has two god objects, the classes are doing too much.
The application works

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3. Test-Driven Development
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. REPL Interface
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

5. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

6. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


## C: Group Work & Projects

I think that my pairing projects went well. The first time we sat by each other the whole time. Every time we worked we did it together. The second time we did both, we worked together and worked on our own. I  think it was fun to work with someone else. Overall I think it all went well. 

### Enigma

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/andrewdwooten/enigma
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma

Writing a program that lets us decode, enrypt and decode. 

Assessed By: Mike

Repo:https://github.com/andrewdwooten/enigma

Notes:

27 tests, all passing
application encrypts, but does not decrypt or crack
some overuse of attr_accessor
File IO stuff could be broken out to separate class
some stuff in Enigma could be broken out to a separate class
1. Overall Functionality

1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
4. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

Do not have feedback. 

## D: Professional Skills
I was able to get my LinkedIn and Resume looking good.

### Gear Up
Title: Growth Mindset

Learning about growth mindset was very helpful for me. I am always getting down on myself for not being good enough or telling myself that I am stupid. Having the conversation on this topic helped me learn ways to talk to myself instead of being negative. I think that growth mindset is very important especially for people who are in positions like we are and are learning brand new things that they are struggling with. It really takes practice, you have to train yourself to have a growth mindset which is hard work. 

Title: Cohort Norms

This was a continuation of growth mindset. They put us in groups of 3 and had us talk about how we were feeling about Turing so far, what things had come up in the last two weeks where you used growth mindset and where you struggled with it. This was really nice to have because it gave each of us time to talk about our struggles and how we were feeling and then get input from those in our group. I learned that the two other people in my group were feeling the same way that I was which was really helpful! It aslo gave us the chance to talk about how we could better have growth mindsets in certain situations. 


  
### Professional Development Workshops
Personal Branding P1

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md 

This workshop was nice to have because it helped me create my LinkedIn and Resume. It gave a me a great example to model after.  
 
Learning to Pair: How to Define the Relationship and Hold Each Other Accountable
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md

This workshop was nice to have because it was right before our first pairing project. It helped us figure out how to work through problems if need be and who to talk to if things just were not working. It also allowed us to help each other work on our own schedules and figure out what way of working is best for us as a team. It also gave us direction on how to break the ice. 

Feedback
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md
This workshop was helpful in the way that it helped us write feedback to our pairing partners in a way that would not be hurtful and instead would be helpful. We wanted to make sure our feedback pointed out positive things as well as things that they can work on next time. Learning how to say all of that in the correct way was helpful.

Personal Branding P2
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p2.md

This workshop was helpful because it showed me that I needed to create a blog/website in order to help people really learn who I am as a person. I am going to work on this by keeping track of how I am feeling and struggles I go through each week so I can at the end summarize all of that into similiar thoughts/feelings which will give me a better idea of who I am and how I deal with things. 






## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Susi Irwin - "Susi was a wonderful introduction to Turing. As my pre-work guide we got together before classes even began and she spent time calming my nerves and answering my questions. Susi helped me get settled into the flow of things and really made me feel at home. She is the sweetest, most positive person I have ever had the chance to work around. I know she will brighten up each place that is lucky enough to get her."

Beth Knight - "I felt comfortable around Beth from the first time we met, I knew we would be instant friends. This was very helpful for me because I was nervous and anxious at first about fitting in to the community. I really appreciate her for helping me when I was feeling in a funk or when I just didn't understand something. She has a positive attitude all of the time and has an amazing drive to get things done. I am so happy to be able to call her a friend."


### Being a Community Member

"I have been so, so fortunate to be matched up with Bailey as she entered Turing this module. Bright, hardworking, empathetic and just all around amazing, Bailey brings with her the grit to accomplish whatever she puts her mind toward." - Susi Irwin Mod4 BE

"I enjoy seeing and working with Bailey every day. I appreciate that she is always excited to learn because her excitement is infectious. I think we’re in the same boat in terms of how we progressed in Mod 1. I like having someone to bounce ideas off who is on the same page as me. She’s a great listener and I appreciate having a good friend in the class." - Beth Knight Mod1 BE

"Bailey is the absolute best. I'm in front end mod one so I'm not in the same building or class with her but I've been fortunate enough to get to know her well. She shares the same traits as me and is very hard on herself. I can see that she had a drive and hunger to understand the material and can be too hard on herself if it doesn't click right away. That being said she has a great attitude and has pulled me up out of a funk multiple times. She is my go to person to confide in about the stress of the program and she always makes me feel better about the situation and inspired to keep moving forward. I look forward to being in the same building as her and working together in the future!" -Staci McWilliams Mod1 FE
