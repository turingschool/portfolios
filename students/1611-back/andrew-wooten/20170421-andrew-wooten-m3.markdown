# Andrew Wooten - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
  This module my primary goal, besides technical competency, was to
play a larger part in the community. I think that I've succeeded fairly well in
in meeting my goal. I worked reasonably hard to support my cohort as well as
anybody else that happened to come along with something that I could help with.
I did my best to keep everyone positive and moving forward through the module.
I had the pleasure of pairing on an informal basis with both Mod1 and Mod2
students this module, which was great. What I'm most proud of this inning is
carrying forward from the idea I had last inning to have Turing participate in
PrideFest this year. I'm immensely happy to be involved in the planning of
such an exciting event, and I'm hoping that it will become an annual thing for
Turing and the Turing community to participate in.
  Aside from my Turing school goals, I'm happy with the progress I've made in
researching companies in the greater Denver area. I wanted to gain some
direction and traction in starting to reach out for informational meetings and
apply for jobs. I'm pretty happy with my organization in that area, and I'm
going to make it a priority, reference Mod4 JobSearch Plan thing-y, to keep
this up and start job-shopping with an amount of seriousness.

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

(Pass)

## B: Individual Work & Projects


* APICurious: GitHub

https://github.com/andrewdwooten/APICurious-GitHub2
http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious
API is a Rails application that implements GitHub OAuth and consumes the
GitHub API to emulate basic functions of GitHub including: viewing your recent
commits, viewing your followers, viewing recent activity of those following you,
and creating a repository.

Takeaways:
  I really enjoyed working through APICurious. I learned a great deal about
  consuming API endpoints. It was challenging at times but not impossible. I
  developed a good flow and groove for working through the API consumption with
  particular attention paid to how I go about testing. VCR is pretty cool stuff.


  ### Github

  Build a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. As a user, I should be able to:

  * X Authenticate with my github account
  * X View basic information about my account (profile pic, number of starred repos, followers, following)
  * X View a summary feed of my recent activity (recent commits)
  * X View a summary feed of recent activity from users whom I follow
  * X View a list of organizations I'm a member of
  * X View a list of my repositories

  **Extensions:**

  * X View a list of open pull requests that I have opened
  * View a list of "@mentions" that I was included in
  * X Create a new repository

* BURRP - Self-Directed Project

https://github.com/andrewdwooten/BURRRP-personal_project
https://burrrp.herokuapp.com
http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project

  BURRP is a Rails application that utilizes the BreweryDB API to allow
  users the ability to browse breweries and their beer offerings. It utilizes
  Twitter OAuth for login as well as AJAX calls and caching.

Takeaways
  The primary focus of this project seemed to be more about optimization rather
  that building out a feature set. I did my best to focus on the optimization
  while building out the features that I wanted for my end application. The
  optimization piece was inarguably the most challenging aspect of this project.
  I appreciated the learning I received in building BURRP, and I enjoyed the
  added levels of complexity I had to implement in order to make things move
  more quickly in the application.

**Feedback**
From Katy:
  It was great to have you on our Cloney Island team. You were so motivated and ready to work all of the time, and I think that helped the team stay focused and positive. I also really appreciated your positive attitude, even when problems arose and we were stuck for some times. I would suggest you take breaks from the code a little more often to clear your head and gain perspective on those tough challenges. It was really a pleasure to have you on the team.
### Gear Up

* Automation
https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/blob/f902d71e6d86a3fd293a5a24b10705c6c34be755/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/one_elijah_annie_schutte_devin.md#pre-reading
    Reflection:
      I found this topic to be really interesting. In truth, I didn’t know that
    automation technology was as far along as it is. I was blown away by the
    creativity one. The content of the GearUp raised a lot of questions for me.
    I could probably spend a lot of time, and countless pages, fleshing out my
    thoughts on them, but I’ll just focus on my largest concern: how will
    society respond to automation? It’s a slightly pointless question with the
    direction technology is going; automation seems like an inevitability at
    this point, but I think that developers and engineers seem to forget to
    question whether they should do something.
      I’m not a doomsday theorist, and I think the idea of ‘prepping’ for the
    apocalypse is fairly laughable. My largest concern with automation isn’t
    the end of days; rather, it’s how people and society will respond when
    they’ve been made obsolete. What really pushes and pulls a person forward
    through life? A biologist somewhere would probably say the intrinsic drives
    to eat, sleep, and mate. No fundamental disagreement from me there, but
    that’s not exactly where I’m going with this. The engineers in the videos
    get repeating the same thing in different words and permutations over and
    over again: ‘This is going to make life easier.’ It reminded me a lot of
    when ‘there’s an app for that’  became a saying. What we’re talking about
    with automation is similar but on a larger scale with a potentially more
    adverse set of consequences.
      I’m a fan of Star Trek. It seems the engineers and developers pushing
    automation technology are too. They seem to have an idea in their heads
    that people will innately, while having all basic needs met, continue to
    push themselves forward. This is the heart of where my worry lies. I would
    submit that some people may continue to push forward, but the majority
    would likely not. In terms of pop culture examples, I think that society
    would more accurately be reflected by the humans in Wall-E rather than Star
    Trek. Most people are working towards the day when they don’t have to work
    anymore. What if they never had to work in the first place, having been
    born into a world where every basic need was met? Would they push forward
    to find and conquer new problems? I think it’s more likely that they would
    sit on whatever manner of couch they have and play video games designed by
    some of the amazing technology that exists.
      I think challenge and struggle not only shape people but drive them forward
    also. It’s here where I find the root of my worry with the implementation of
    automation technologies. I see room for the possibility that people will no
    longer move forward, again Wall-E vs. Star Trek.  I can own that I’m
    slightly pessimistic about the intrinsic nature of my own species. I’d argue
    that I’m a realist, but that’s a different conversation entirely. For the
    record, my time at Turing has made me more of an optimist in this area than
    I was in my previous life.  As far as automation goes, well, it’s coming
    whether anyone not making money from it wants it to or not. It will be
    interesting to see how society and culture respond. At the very least, I
    hope that my order stops getting screwed up at Taco Bell.

* Microaggression
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown
    Reflection:
      This topic was incredibly interesting to have to round table with my
    classmates. Microaggression is a word that gets thrown around a lot in the
    media, both social and typical, but it doesn't seem that people take the
    time to understand what a microaggression is. In any given week, there is
    at least one fool who throws around the term in combination with the
    phrase 'I'm offended'. While the two can go hand-in-hand, I would submit
    that the two more often than not don't, and that is where the trouble
    lies. A microaggression is a finicky thing to qualify. I would define a it
    as an unintentional offense which subtly demeans another person.
    These aren't necessarily verbal offenses: 'That's *actually*
    a good idea.' Sometimes it can be as simple as a change in body language,
    whom a person is addressing, and so on. It can take many forms. There were
    several conclusions that the class came to in its conversation; I think the
    most important of these is individual responsibility.
      Microaggressions as a cultural topic has come to light largely because of
    people claiming to have been a victim of such offenses. Microaggressions
    exist, and I would never dispute that, however it is necessary for a person
    to have some resilience. Crying foul and lambasting an individual for
    being unintentionally offensive to you is generally uncalled for, and the
    prevalence of this behavior undermines getting the topic taken seriously.
    This is, I think, why microaggressions are a joke in many circles. An
    individual has the personal responsibility to issue a gentle direct
    correction and then move on. There's an HR cliche that comes to mind here:
    "Permitting is promoting." If an individual allows damaging behaviors to be
    committed against them on a regular basis, then they are playing a part in
    that narrative through their passivity. A person should be neither a
    doormat nor a brick wall to an offending individual, rather they should be
    a force for guidance.
      Overall, I, again, appreciated the conversation we had on the topic. I
    was happy with how thorough we were and the freedom everyone had to speak
    their mind. I was encouraged that people appreciated the gravity of what
    we were discussing and pursued an intellectual approach to it.

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

Hamilton Posse
  I set out this inning to play a larger part in the Turing community through
my activities with Hamilton posse. I was overjoyed that we had more participation
this time around. While the majority of the group focused on developing an
application for the Wellness Challenge, I chose to focus my efforts on
getting Turing out in the community. This inning I proposed to the posse that we
get Turing involved in PrideFest this year. I made contact with another student
who helps run a NPO who shared my interest. With our combined efforts we brought
the proposal to staff. We received a wealth of encouragement and excitement at
the idea. We are currently still planning. PrideFest is actually the weekend
after intermission week following next inning. I'm really excited to be a part
of planning such an exciting event, and I hope it's something that we'll be
successful in and will make an annual event for the Turing community.
