# Andrew Wooten - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
  I came into this module uncertain what my goals should be. Obviously the job
  search has my attention, but I didn't have an idea of what I should set out to
  accomplish this inning. My desire to contribute to the community is still
  strong, and I carried forward with plans to lead more Spike sessions. I
  focused my Spikes on self-care/maintenance, and I was happy with the outcomes
  from the sessions. I was also actively involved as a Student Advisory Board
  representative; it was a great experience, and I was happy with my contributions
  to the SAB efforts.
  Technically, as the module went on, I gained a large respect for and interest
  in working with JavaScript. I think it is immensely cool and a more diverse
  tool than Ruby. I'm happy with the progression of my JavaScript knowledge
  base and look forward to pushing myself further with JS-centric personal
  projects.
  Overall, it's been an interesting inning, and I'm pleased with my trajectory.
  I'm looking forward to taking the plunge into a job and continuing to gain
  experience with JS.

### Projects

#### Capstone Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meyerhoferc/will-legislate-for-money)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/capstone_project_overview)

Description:
  Will Legislate For Money is a Python/Django app built as a tool to give
  voters easier access to information on their legislatorsâ€™ campaign funding
  and congressional action. It includes integration of Twitter log-in via
  django-social-auth. The user is able to browse legislators, view a
  summary/visualization of a legislators campaign contributions by industry and
  organization, and view bills currently sponsored by the legislator. The user
  is able to 'follow' legislators of interest and have them appear on their
  user page. From the user page, a user is able to view the Twitter feed of any
  legislator that they are currently following.

  My areas of focus for this project included integration of the Twitter
  log-in, establishing a database relationship between legislators/user, and
  adding the ability for a user to view a legislators Twitter feed from the
  user profile page. Additionally, I utilized the aXe Chrome extension to
  identify and resolve many accessibility issues that existed from the previous
  version of the project.

Takeaways:
  I walked away from this project with more confidence in my ability to
  explore and successfully navigate the unfamiliar. I was happy to have the
  opportunity to apply the concepts from our accessibility lesson, and I look
  forward to exploring different techniques for that purpose. Python/Django was
  interesting to work in; I appreciated the level of configuration that it
  offered over Rails; it's a language and framework that I will likely continue
  to explore in the future; although, JavaScript still wins as my favorite thing.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Spike Sessions:
  It's apparent that Turing is a fairly stressful environment in itself;
  students are under constant pressure to perform, and it can absolutely
  lead to unhealthy personal behaviors and coping mechanisms. We've got to keep
  in mind that this doesn't include any external stressors: housing, finances,
  family, etc.
  This inning I sought to present my knowledge of stress management and time
  management and hopefully help out our community members. I led 3 Spike
  sessions covering stress and time management techniques. I was happy to be
  to pass on the information I have to the attendees. One student showed up to
  two of my sessions, and I was grateful for the opportunity to follow up. He
  reported that some of my strategies had helped him take the edge off what he
  was experiencing. I'm slightly disappointed at the attendance of my Spike
  sessions, and I think that the lack of attendance is potentially an indicator
  to the depth of the problem in the community, but I'm happy with the positive
  change I was able to affect in the community members that attended.

PrideFest:
  Last inning Alex Koch and I came to staff with the proposal that Turing
  should attend PrideFest this year. I am still ecstatic with the amount of
  support the community has communicated; many have expressed support and a want
  to contribute to the float and the march in the parade. I'm proud to get to
  play a part in the event, and I'm excited to have Turing represented at
  PrideFest. I'm hopeful that the community will participate en masse and that
  it will become a regular event for Turing.
