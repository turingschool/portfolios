# (Casey Macaulay) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this module were to:
1) Get projects finished ahead of time (stay on top of time management).
2)Get to class on time every day.
3) Pass and achieve each of the learning goals.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/jungle_beats/casey-macauley/jungle_beat.markdown)

In Jungle Beats I created a Linked List, a data structure commonly used by computer scientists, which holds data within individual nodes. Jungle Beats includes methods that enable you to append, prepend, and insert data into the list, remove the last node, and check to see if specific data is included within the list.Specifically, this Linked List will play back the sounds given to it as data that is stored within the nodes.

- 20 tests all passing
- talked about writing tests for the exact assertions we expect from the spec
- talked about refactoring and use of instance variables.

## Scores:  

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

Application does not run
some issues with edge cases and deeper testing
overall code was written well, just crashed
some opportunities to break out things into separate objects,
started to head in that direction, just didn't finish.

(evaluation scores)
1. Overall Functionality

1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
4. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

(feedback to me)
Casey,
    Working with you on Enigma was a very good experience and I feel like you helped me improve my problem solving skills and understanding of the material. Having a positive and humorous attitude made you easy to work with. When things would blow up you never got discouraged and we could even have a laugh about some of them. You set a good habit of finding and fixing bugs before moving on to the next problem, even if they didn't immediately break anything. You were also quick and willing to explain how any part of the project worked that you built without me. I like to be able to understand how everything works in the project and this enabled that understanding.
    Before starting the project read the instructions carefully! This goes for both of us. We did a good job of white-boarding to conceptualize a complex problem or class, but we should have done it to illustrate the framework of the entire project that is in sync with the instructions. A few times it was hard to follow you when talking about how some complex logic was working. When we then illustrated it in a notebook or on the whiteboard it was easier to follow. It didn't help of course that sometimes I was mentally drained. We both were willing to take a break from working on the project for things like dinner, it would be good though to set some mandatory break times away from the computer so we maintain the mental capacity to solve complex problems.
    We didn't complete the project but you clearly know what you are doing and I know we could have finished it if we had a little more time. It took Alan Turing and his team almost 6 months to crack Enigma, we almost did it in a week. I look forward to pairing with you on a future project as we progress through the modules.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

I. Growth Mindset 12/2
Coming from the education world, "growth mindset" is a definitely a current buzzword. First introduced to it in an elementary
school, it seemed like such a straight forward concept - putting it into action, however, is an entirely different story.

As a perfectionist, it is sometimes hard for me to accept that not everything is going to be exactly as it should be. From
what I've learned/seen about software development so far is that there isn't just one way to do things, and you should go
down the route that makes the most sense to you. I think that this will help with my perfectionism - there isn't a "perfect" way to do it, I should trust my gut and do it my way. I am coming into Turing with extremely limited coding experience, and knowing that this is all new to me, the expectation that I'll not understand everything is there.

My triggers that would send me back to a fixed mindset are:
- If I've tried approaching/researching something multiple times and it still isn't working.
- If I get advice, try it, and it doesn't work I will be frustrated - if the person helping me didn't know what was going on, how am I supposed to get it?

My peers can help by asking me questions that will help me view the problem/challenge from a new perspective, and by asking
for my help because teaching will help me learn something.

My main takeaways from the Growth Mindset Gear Up were:
- Adopt the "power of yet" vs. the "tyranny of now"
- Praise the process
- Meaning of effort & difficulty are transformed

II. 12/9
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
