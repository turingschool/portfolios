## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Rails Engine

* https://github.com/CjMoore/rails_engine
* Expose an internal API

Feature Delivery
1. Completion

Note: Test harness fails the first time - appears to be issue with the harness and not the code - has been looked at by multiple instructors

All pass on the second run consistently

4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

**Technical Quality**

1. Test-Driven Development

  *Note: 99.84 coverage - intermittant failures but all related to the same issue and students can fix them on the fly. Only   happens on instructor's machine. Of course.*

  *3.5: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.*
  
2. Code Quality

  *4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.*
  
3. API Design

  *4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.*
  
4. Queries

  *4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as      joins and includes.*

#### Feedback

Feedback from Andy:
It was an absolute pleasure to have you both on the team and leading us for Cloney Island. Our project benefited greatly from having you at the helm. I really appreciated how well organized you kept us. Your approach to managing our workflow with frequent check-ins and clarification of progress/problems was amazing and greatly comforting. You made going through the project more fun and were phenomenal at celebrating at a problem breakthrough. I don’t have any feedback on anything that I think you should change, but I encourage you to maintain your level of enthusiasm, organization, and team-oriented mindset. You’re awesome and so was the opportunity to work with you. 

Feedback from Ryan:
Katy, it was a pleasure to work with you on Cloney Island. Your drive, management skills, and dedication to quality are inspiring. As you previously mentioned, I believe that one reason we worked well together was our similar approach. There's a bonus point? Let's do it. It requires a companion app? No points left behind.  The final product of our efforts was a reflection of not only our team's will to succeed, but also your detail-oriented management. I predicted that managing five people was going to be a significant challenge, but you handled it in stride. I don't have any critical feedback for you, thanks for your hard work…it certainly paid off!

Feedback from Max:
Katy:
You did a fantastic job as a project manager. You set the tone, made key decisions, and took full responsibility for managing and coordinating the project. I was impressed with how you both gave the members of our team the space to find where we could best contribute and also provided great direction. This project was an example for me of what a highly functioning team can accomplish with good work flow and great testing and your leadership was key to that success. It was a pleasure to work with you.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown

Automation will have a huge impact on our economy. I image that by the time I retire, the job market will be a very different place. I think I’m certainly at risk, as a web developer, of being replaced by automation, but I intend to try to stay ahead of the curve by studying machine learning and trying to become a contributor on that front. It’s not clear to me exactly what responsibility regarding automation looks like; I care about people losing jobs, but I also support automation. I think we have to reshape our society to allow opportunities for education and skills to reach more people and remove some of the boundaries currently in place.


#### Grit
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

Although this gear-up is exactly the same, I’m trying to rethink grit as it concerns me in Mod 3. I think I have been persistent and passionate just to make it this far, and I think this is where it starts to become more difficult. Seven months is a long time to be in this environment, and it would be impossible to get through this without passion. I particularly like building personal projects where I have freedom to experiment with technologies and implementations. I just like to see what I can make given no constraints. I would like opportunities to build things that have a creative aspect, like games. I have the most passion and the most frustration when I’m building emotionally relevant work. I like technically-engaging challenges and learning new tools and languages.


#### MicroAggressions
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md

Can one summarize microaggressions in a few sentences? No. This session was taken over by people who were defensive, and it forced us to cater to their feelings of victimization, despite the fact that other people in the classroom had actual experience with microaggressions and may have wanted to use that space to talk more openly about their experiences.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was available for Mod 2 students on most of their projects. We didn't pair, but I would often sit with them and let them talk through their error. I also led a spike with Andy Wooten over RSpec to teach some of the more sophisticated testing patterns.
