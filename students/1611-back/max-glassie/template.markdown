# Max Glassie - M1 - Mid_Mod Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I came to Turing in order to jump into a community where I could take my programming knowledge to the next level. I was looking also for an entryway into the technical community. After pushing my individual study as far as I felt I was able, my plan was just to do whatever you all said. I didn't have specific goals beyond gaining proficiency in Ruby and for the opportunity to deepen my theoretical knowledge. 

I'm much more motivated by intellectual growth than I am on "becoming a developer." In that sense, I'm driving towards those outcomes more than the tangible skillset or label. 

I have a learning characteristic that I can't execute until I have a full grasp of the concepts. This can lead to challenges in meeting specific functionality goals.

## A: Mid-Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date-Night

(description)
You are a junior developer at Netflix. You're on a team that is developing a list of movies for Netflix users called "Suggested for You." Each time movies are added to Netflix, an algorithm determines a score of how likely a given user is to enjoy that movie.

    Scores are integers between 0 and 100
    No two movies will get the same score

It is your job to take new movies that have been scored, and store them in a Binary Search Tree.

    Well written tests for the functionality that is finished
    Talked about some test time saving techniques
    Consistent tabbing and 2 space tabs
    Good method and variable names
    Cool use of recursion, but I think it can be more concise


(evaluation scores)

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:
1. Functional Expectations
    1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
    3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion technique

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](Repo: https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-complete_me.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

(description)
Everyone in today's smartphone-saturated world has had their share of interactions with textual "autocomplete." You may have sometimes even wondered if autocomplete is worth the trouble, given the ridiculous completions it sometimes attempts.

But how would you actually make an autocomplete system?

In this project, CompleteMe we'll be exploring this idea by a simple textual autocomplete system. Perhaps in the process we will develop some sympathy for the developers who built the seemingly incompetent systems on our phones...

https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/complete_me/max_ashley.markdown

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations
    4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

2. Test-Driven Development

    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
    3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

(feedback to me)
No specific individual feedback to me. 

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-glassie
Resume sent to Meg.)

(takeaways from session)

#### Learning to Pair
We started our project with a comprehensive DTR that really helped us as we progressed. Some aspects of that discussion were not captured in our written DTR but were valuable - especially where we outlined how our personalities inform our collaboration styles.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
Mine for Ashley sent to Mike Dao in Slack message. We did a comprehensive debrief before we went into our project evaluation and give good feedback to each other. The session from Allison was a helpful way to build on this and give a framework for the future.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I attended the Hack the Dot hackathon. I did my best to be supportive of my classmates.
