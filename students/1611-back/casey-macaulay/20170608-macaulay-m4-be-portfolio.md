* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.
* 2: **Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.**
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

*The hot links/top read feature doesn’t actually work*

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

*There is a strange `save_link` method in the model.  Why not just use the build in `save` that rails provides for us?*

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don’t drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they’re written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

*Thank you for taking time to style your app!*

* **3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the applications**
* 2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
* 1: Project has insufficient documentation

*Best docuentation I’ve seen so far, good job!*

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* **3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.**
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

_Good work with functionality. I don't see many bugs, but I also don't see an extension. If I'm wrong, please let me know!_

### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- **3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.**
- 2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.
- 1: Team did not design their service.

_Good work with the API documentation for the backend. I don't see a schema anywhere, but I know y'all talked through what you wanted your schema to look like_

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**
- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

_You have robust test coverage for your backend, which is awesome! I only see a WIP for the frontend tests, but I like the fact that you attempted frontend integration tests (even though you didn't quite get it to work)._

### HTML/UI

- **4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.**
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

_Your UI looks great. Everything appears to be well-organized and structured._

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

_You kept OO in mind when organizing your code base and consistently used ES6 and good naming conventions. There is room for improvement here with keeping functions single responsibility, but I think you both are off to a great start._

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**
- 3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

_You utilized git well and created branches, PR's, and engaged in meaningful discussion on your PR's. Keep this up!_

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

_You used PT to track your progress and estimate stories._

## D: Gear Up Recap

I really enjoyed having the opportunity to create a gear-up this inning, it is something I've wanted to do for a while. I was really happy that people wanted to work on Danger of a Single Story with me, I feel that recognizing that we have inherent bias, and being able to talk about stereotypes and initial ideas of people is really important before delving into some of the more sensitive topics that we have here at Turing.
