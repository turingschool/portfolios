# (Casey Macaulay) - (/M3/) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I hoped to:
- Understand what an API was, and know when, why and how to both consume and create one;
- Increase my knowledge of javascript;
- Use a map in a project;
- Learn and use SASS in a project;

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Evaluation Criteria
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
## 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
## 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## 3. Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
## 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
## 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I struggled with individual work. While my API Curious was ultimately a success, I struggled to timebox myself, especially when it came to learning and implementing something new, and I was a little stubborn when it came to how dedicated to my wireframes I was. The personal project was tough for me as well, although I feel like I have a much stronger understanding of javascript now!

#### (API Curious)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/cmacaulay/git-cloned)
* [Heroku](https://git-cloned.herokuapp.com)

A basic clone of GitHub, implemented using their API.

#### (Crisis Tracker)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/cmacaulay/crisis-tracker)
* [Heroku](https://crisis-tracker.herokuapp.com)

The idea behind the project was to have a visual representation of where humanitarian crises were happening, how long they tend to affect populations for, and to pinpoint the most affected areas. Future iterations will add a filter to the map, and visualize aid flow to see if the two datasets correlate as strongly as one might think.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I really enjoyed working with Ryan on Rails Engine. It was the first time I've felt comfortable with Active Record queries. Cloney Island was a difficult project, and it was hard to overcome the initial group tension.

#### (Rails Engine)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

In Rails Engine we worked as a team of two to create JSON API endpoints for some shop data, including endpoints that were the result of some analysis done using advanced ActiveRecord queries.

# Evaluation

Students: Casey, Ryan

Evaluated by: Meeka

# Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

# Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

99.84%

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.


#### (Cloney Island)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/folio-share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)

Folio-Share - DropBox (but not quite).

### Completion

**Client Expectations**

*   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
    *   2: Below expectations

**User Experience**

*   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
    *   3: As expected

**Organization**

*   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
    *   3: As expected

### Technical Evaluation

**Git Workflow**

*   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
    *   3: As expected

**Test Quality**

*   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
    *   3: As expected

**Code Quality**

*   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
    *   3: As expected

**Bonus**

We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

*   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    *   0: No

### Gear Up

The gearup on micro-aggressions brought about a lot of great introspection and conversation for our cohort. As a person of color, I have often experienced micro aggressions, especially around the ambiguity of my race. There is such a fine line between genuine curiosity and perceived micro-aggressions, it was helpful to hear from those who had never heard the term before, and opened the door to some important conversations. I also really enjoyed the automation gearup, and especially enjoyed having other students lead the conversation.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I served my final term as SAB rep, and led a spike on getting SASSy. Because of our heavy workload this mod, it was a little more difficult to engage with other modules, but I think in SAB we hacked towards some small but effectual changes. It was intimidating to lead a spike! But it was really enjoyable and encouraging to talk with front end students about best practices. Additionally, I paired a number of times with some friends in the module below.
