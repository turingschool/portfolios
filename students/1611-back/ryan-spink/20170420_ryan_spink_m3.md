# Ryan Spink - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 This module was about pushing myself to do my best work under pressure. After mod 2, I felt confident in my abilities to rapidly learn programming and mod 3 honed in my ability to teach myself. I had heard that this module was the hardest, and that it eats people up...so my goal was to hit the ground running, take up every challenge I could, expand my community involment further, and never look back. 
 
 I think that I was successful in accomplishing what I set out to do. I learned SO much this module, handled the pressure, tried to help others and give back to the community, and pretty much loved every minute of it. Big thanks to Sal and Ali, you guys were great and we'll miss your teachings and support as we move on!

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS

# Evaluation Criteria
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
## 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
## 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## 3. Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
## 4. Progression/Completion
4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
## 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

 Individual work/projects consisted of APICurious and the Self-Directed Project. I enjoyed both of them and learned a hell of a lot completing both of them. API Curious was a great but onerous intro to consuming APIs and the s-d project was a great process of bringing an idea to fruition as well as learning JS fundamentals!

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/APICurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

 API Curious is a primer in consuming apis and oauth. We set out to clone basic functionality of a personal github home page. I'm particularly proud of my work here, it was great to be able to create some real functionality on my own and I pushed to make a post request work!

# Evaluation

You’ll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

#### Self-Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/droplet)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

 The self-directed project is a test of bringing an idea to fruition within the parameters set forth. It was fun to work on, even through problems with my initial idea (raspi giving bad readings). I learned a ton about JS, which I find to be the greatest learning part of this project. I enjoyed it overall and will continue to add to and hone the project. One note, is that I was super fried mid-week 5 so ended up taking the better part of 4 days off to get back to square one. Seems to have paid off because I accomplished more in the last three days that I though possible. Pretty confident in my abilities to teach myself and work through complex problems at a good pace. 

 Waiting on eval.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

 Group projects this inning consisted of Rails Engine and Cloooooney Island! I dug both of them. My project partners were awesome on both, which really helps when the goal is produce a top notch quality product. Expanded my knowledge exponentially on both of these projects. Hard, time consuming, worth it.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

 The goal in Rails Engine was to do business analtics on a set of data and create API endpoints for those calculations as well as general db tables. Lot of work put in on this one, really happy with the way Casey and I were able to work together to kick some ass (first and only all 4 project).

#### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TheKaterTot/cloney_island)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)

For this project we were given the task of cloning stack overflow's functionality. Built in multitenancy auth, token based api access, upvote/downvote system, companion app, and the rest of the kitchen sink. Our team was firing on all cylinders from day one and I think it's really evident in the product we put forth. We worked out asses off, together, to create something much better than one of us could do alone in twice the time. Great project, great team, super happy with how this turned out. Learned so, so much.

### Feedback to Me

 From Katy: You were a great addition to our Cloney Island team. I particularly appreciate your ability to focus on a problem and find a solution. You were incredibly dedicated to the issues you took on, and you never failed to deliver. I wish I had more criticism; your style suits mine in that I also like to take a problem and solve it independently before coming together to discuss any problems or solutions. Thanks for being a great teammate.

 From Andy: We’ve gotten to work together on a few projects now. It was great to get to work with you again. As previously, it was a great experience. I appreciate the commitment you made to the team and the -oomph with which you tackled the problems that you had. I absolutely share your enthusiasm for having a great test suite, and I appreciate your dedication to the quality of testing that we applied to the project. I don’t have any feedback for change for you. Overall, I think you should keep up the good work. Maintain your awesome attitude in approaching problems and your drive to attack every challenge that’s available on the table. Look forward to working with you again in the future.

From Max: 
 I really saw your competitive edge come to the fore in this project. You were relentlessly driven to do quality work and your energy to produce a great product helped drive all of us to take this project above and beyond. You’ve got formidable technical skill and a strong work ethic. Not only that, I really appreciated your professional and personal demeanor. You have a positive outlook and were really supportive of all us. We made decisions and took responsibility as a team; you were constantly making sure that we were on the same page and did a great job communicating. 

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/blob/f902d71e6d86a3fd293a5a24b10705c6c34be755/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/one_elijah_annie_schutte_devin.md)

 Automation is a super interesting subject that I'm fairly opinionated on, but like everything open to expanding my horizons on. I really liked that these were lead by mod-4 students. I feel like we had more interaction throughout this gear up than any other...by far. I think that material was pretty one sided and fairly alarmist, but I definitely didn't discount the message that was being put out. Like all things, this was a chance to learn from others and their opinions and to see how that can fit and modify my perspective. 

#### Microaggression

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

 This was a contentious (seemingly like most, unfortunately) gear up in our cohort, but from my perspective is was great. I think that awareness and learning the hard topics is really important, especially in this field. I think that people can readily fall into a bad habit of microaggressions for one reason or another and that having some semblance of awareness is good not only for those around you (that won't have to deal with your crap) and your own image as well. I think that there is some degree of tolerance people should have for minor microaggressions, insofar that it's not worth getting into conniptions over a random minor offense, but that in general awareness and trying to be better person is never a bad thing!
 
 
## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### Turing Lab Posse (co-lead)

 Co-lead the Turing Lab Posse. This was one of my goals from the beginning of Mod-1 and I'm glad to see it come to fruition. This posse is actually where I first presented my idea of water quality monitoring, which became my personal project. This inning we focused on revamping the posse to actually have direction and do something. We have a core group of consistent followers that are helping us reach our goal of creating a physical arcade for Turing (almost done!). Co-leading this posse has helped with the people-management side of things, and I'm glad I was able to get some experience with that as I still have not been project manager on a reg group project. Shoutout to Spencer and Dan for their diligence and hard work in this posse. Really happy we were able to resurrect it from the ashes!

#### SAB Rep

 Second module as SAB rep for our cohort. I think that Casey and I do a pretty good job in this position and run a tight ship. People seem to be pretty comfortable with us in this position and it's nice having a cohort that's pretty chill. However, people's feathers were surely ruffled this inning by stress and other factors so it was interesting to see how we could provide a relaxed, non-toxic, organized space for them to talk about their experience on Fridays. Really enjoyed doing this for two modules, and I'm better for having taken this up. Huge shoutout to Allison, she's encorporated agile into how SAB rolls and has smoothed things out enormously over only two modules. 

#### Spikes

 Co-led 4 spikes as lead of T-Lab Posse. All surrounding building our T-Lab arcade...which is almost done...and boy, is it glorious!
