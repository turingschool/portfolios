# Charlotte Moore - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This Module I focused primarily on learning the material, and exploring new concepts and frameworks on my own. I also focused on learning as much as I could about working in groups. I feel as if I was successful in these regards. I chose to develop my Personal Project using Node/Express and, despite my ultimate defeat, I think I learned a lot from the exprience. At times it felt as if I was fumbling through the JavaScript, but it made the small successes even more rewarding. All in all it was a humbling experience, and I feel more prepared for Mod 4 because of it. I learned a lot about patience from working with my team on Cloney Island. I chose to be the PM on that project, which proved to be more of a challenge than my previous experience as PM. I learned how to step aside and allow my teammates to struggle through features for the benefit of their own learning. I also learned a lot about pairing from working with my team. Overall I'm really happy with my level of proficiency with the material we covered this Mod, as well as the skills I learned with regards to working in a team.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
### 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### 3. Testing
4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
### 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
### 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects for this Mod were APICurious and the Personal Project. In APICurious I consumed the Reddit API and recreated certian functionality of that site. The two most challenging parts of that project were the OAuth and consuming and displaying comments. For the Personal Project, I chose to do sentiment analysis using the Watson Alchemy Language API. Initially, I chose to create my project using Node/Express, but ultimately my skill level with JavaScript (or rather, lack thereof) made it impossible to continue on that path, and I threw together a rails app in the last two days. 

### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

In this project I consumed the Reddit API to reproduce certian functionality. A User could OAuth through Reddit and view their subscribed sub-reddits, view the top posts on those sub-reddits, and view the comments for those posts. 

I chose not to be graded. 

### Info is Everywhere

* [NODE GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/info_is_everywhere)
* [RAILS GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/personal_project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

For my Personal Project I chose to use the Watson Alchemy Language API to do sentiment analysis. My initial plan was to use this API to analyze news articles and use a data visualization to display the result. This has proven to be difficult. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

This Mod we did two group projects, Rails Engine and Cloney Island. In Rails Engine we seeded data from another Turing Project (Sales Engine) and created an internal API with that data. I worked with Katy on Rails Engine, which was awesome. For Cloney Island, my team and I cloned KickStarter. While we struggled with certain parts of the project, ultimately I was really pleased with the result. 

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

For Rails Engine, Katy and I seeded and exposed the data from Sales Engine in an internal API.

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

Note: Test harness fails the first time - appears to be issue with the harness and not the code - has been looked at by multiple instructors

All pass on the second run, consistently

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

Note: 99.84 coverage - intermittant failures but all related to the same issue and students can fix them on the fly. Only happens on instructor's machine. Of course.

* 3.5: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

### Cloney Island

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/cloney_island)
 * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)
 
For Cloney Island Spencer, Eric, Edilene, and I cloned KickStarter. This project focused on multi-tenanacy and permissions. We ultimately had 6 user types, each with seperate permissions. 

#### Completion

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Prior to this Gear Up I knew what a microagression was, I just didn't know what to call it. I can understand and empathize with people who have had to deal with microagressions on a daily basis, both in school and the workplace. I think the conversations we had on this topic were really enlightening for me, particularly when it comes to how certain members of my cohort felt being a part of the Turing community. I think one of the most valuable things I took away from this Gear Up is the knowledge that, reguardless of an individual's privilege, everyone can feel the effects of microagressions. 

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/blob/f902d71e6d86a3fd293a5a24b10705c6c34be755/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/one_elijah_annie_schutte_devin.md#pre-reading)

This was a really interesting Gear Up. I am of the opinion that technology is neither inherently evil or good, and it was interesting to learn that people believe strongly that technology is absolutely good. I hope that the readings and discussion in this Gear Up was able to persuade people of the potential risk that technology can pose to society. I believe strongly that the impact technology can have on society depends on how it's used. It's important to be aware, particuarly as developers, of the disparity between the intent and actual use of a piece of technology. I think this Gear Up on Automation attemped to address that issue.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### BASH Spike

James, Eric, Ediline, and I planned and co-lead a gear up on [BASH](https://gist.github.com/CjMoore/13565b944d20d102488812d51b9d5630). It was our intent to teach students about BASH and how to style their BASH prompts. We also had a discussion on how to make and use an alias, as well as Atom shortcuts. 

#### Turing Lab

This Mod I participated in the Turing Lab posse. It was really fun learning about and working with a RaspberryPi. I contributed by doing research and testing the RetroPi emulator. Spencer, Ryan, and Dan did a great job in leading and organizing tasks for the arcade cabinet, and I'm excited to see the final product. 

#### Feedback

From: Eric
<p>When the module first started, I heard people calling her "gem Charlotte" and now I know why. Not only is she the most capable developer I've encountered at Turing, she is an outstanding PM. She let the group take on it's own rhythm and consequently we all performed better than average. I grew as a developer through pairing with her on several user stories and am thankful to have her in 1611.</p>

From: Edilene
<p>You are a powerhouse!!! You impressed me the first time we paired and you still do. Management skills, problem solving, wit, determination are only a few things I can say about you. Please continue teaching others while being kind and accepting. I know this can sound cheesy but you will become an irreplaceable developer and any company will be lucky to have you on their team. </p>

From: Spencer
<p> Charlotte, has the dedication coupled with the willingness to stretch her abilities makes you an extremely valuable team member and a pleasure to work with. She served as project manager and I truly believe that she drove everyone in our team to do the best work that we could do while contributing huge amounts of work herself. She was willing to help any way that she could to drive each member of the group to success. My only concern for Charlotte is driven by two of her strongest qualities: drive and dedication. I believe that her willingness to pull long hours comes from a love of the work, however, over time this can become grueling. Particularly if she continues to take on the majority of work in team settings, as each group member should contribute meaningfully, relieving her of some of the weight she shoulders for the betterment of the team. Charlotte, you are truly an incredible programmer, and I have no doubt in my mind that you will be extremely successful, but don't overwork yourself on the way there! Try and smile once ;) </p>
