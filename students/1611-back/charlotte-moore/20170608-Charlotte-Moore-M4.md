# Charlotte Moore - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This Mod I set out with the intention to learn JavaScript and prepare myself for a career in software development. Last Mod I attempted to make a project in Node and ultimately accepted my defeat. However after the first few weeks of Mod 4 I felt much more comfortable with JavaScript, and was able to build an application using Node.js/Express (Quantified Self). It was my intention to do a lot more work on my job search this inning, but about half way through I decided that it would be in my best interest to just focus on finishing the program. I absolutely feel prepared to start working as a junior dev, and am really happy with my overall experience at Turing. 

## Individual Assessment

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* **4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

*Good use of partials for server side rendering, good use of active record in the hot reads app.  Overall conventional RoR style and clean code*

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

*Overall fairly good use of SRP in your JS code.  I see a lot of building up of HTML string in some of your functions and worth pulling out into their own function. You have a dead if statement in the if block of your `printLink` function.  Good use of ES6 fat arrow functions.*

### 4. Testing

* **4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don’t drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they’re written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

*Good use of sad and happy path testing in features.  Sufficent testing around models and controllers*

### 5. User Interface

* **4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use**
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

*Well styled easy to use application.*

### 6. Documentation

* 4: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application including a screencast or tutorial
* **3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the applications**
* 2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
* 1: Project has insufficient documentation

### 7. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

*Great use of smaller feature branches and small atomic commits.  Only suggestion is to squash commits such as `adds test currently fails`.  I would make a WIP commit, then squash when that test actually does pass*

## B: Group Work & Projects

### Howler (Capstone)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/howler)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/capstone_project_overview)

Howler is an application that interacts with the Watson Alchemy Language API to run sentiment analysis on user input and displays the data in graphs. We also created a Chrome extension to go along with our application. The extension allows the user to highlight text, right click and choose an option from the context menu to analyze the selected text. The extension opens a new tab and displays the data. 

### 1. Project Management

*   4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions
*   **3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime**
*   2: Team has used Tracker as a respository of information
*   1: Tracker shows little to no use

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   **4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint**
*   **3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint**
*   2: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed at the end of the sprint, but has a plan to get them done
*   **1: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed, and has no plan to complete them**

### Quantified Self

 * [GitHub URL Backend](https://github.com/CjMoore/quantified-self-be)
 * [GitHub URL Frontend](https://github.com/CjMoore/quantified-self)
 * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)
 
Quantified Self is a food diary application that uses a Node.js/Express backend. The entire application is written in JavaScript. This was the first project in which we created two completely seperate applications that handle the frontend and backend independantly. I learned a lot about how to make two applications communcate with eachother.

#### Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

#### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

*I'm really impressed with this app overall.  Great job!
I can enter in negative calories for a food :( otherwise I think it's a 4*

#### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- **3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.**
- 2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.
- 1: Team did not design their service.

*Willing to bump this to a 4 if you can get me a schema.  I couldn't open the one in the README Good documenation.*

#### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**
- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

*I know unit tests for the front end we're difficult to get up and running. Backend tests are sufficent.  I would like to see response codes tests for a succsessful post, or a unprocessable entity.  I get two failing unit tests for the backend*

#### HTML/UI

- **4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.**
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

*Y'all! These checkboxes are mad fresh. Losing my shit over here.  Everything is well styled, the UX makes a lot of sense.
Well designed, only small demerit is there should be a way for me to navigate back to the homepage without clicking on the back button.*

#### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

*Not really syntax or style, but I would pass in the values directly into the model instead of passing the params object. Good use of ES6 syntax like fat arrows.
Find meals function is a little bit gnarly and could use a refactor. Other than that good clean code, good separation of files and concerns.*

#### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

*I think Good use of feature branches and pull requests.  I have a few suggestions about some of your git workflow.
It would be nice if each feature branch is smaller.  For example you have one called 'api-diary-endpoints'.
There should be separate branches for each of those diary-endpoints.  For example 'get-all-diaries'.  Also it is good practice
not to litter your commit history.  For instance update README.md there are multiple commits with that message.
Try using `git commit --amend` this will let you keep the same commit message as your previous commit.  I would also
look into squashing.*

#### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

## D: Gear Up Recap

I really enjoyed running a Gear Up this inning. My team and I ran a our Gear Up on Epistemology. We tried to focus on the process that the practice of philosophy employs and how that can be helpful in programming. I think some people enjoyed it more than others. We utilized most of the time for a large group discussion regarding the nature of knowledge. We presented questions and asked for logial arguements from the participants. It was really hard to prepare ourselves for the group discussion because it's hard to predict how people would interpret the way in which we presented our arguement, however I think we were able to respond well. I really liked having the opportunity to create a Gear Up, and see what the process looked like from the other side.
