# Seth Moser - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to learn the syntax of ruby going into this module but now I really want to get into TDD and get better at it.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 2
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/themenintights/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

(write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.)

(evaluation comments)

(If this were the second week in it would be all 3's and 4's, for right now because this is the end of the mod all two's)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Enigma Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/themenintights/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

(Use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.)

(evaluation comments)

* 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.

(feedback to me)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Enigma DTR

* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dRm4vXurdH9Btv7t04qwV1PHORmtBZPg3j86SVCmrI/edit#]()

It was nice going over how we would be working together before we started the project, being able to see a plan helped my confidence in starting the project.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

* [Workshop URL]()
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

(takeaways from session)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

You did well communicating in person and conveying your ideas. When we split up I could have used faster response times when using slack, esspecially when it was the night before it was due and we were trying to flush out the rest of our problems. When give the project it really helped a lot that you got it started and gave us something to work with. Although for the next project it would be really helpful if you included me with the beginning so I could see your thought process and how you came up with what you did. It would have really helped me learn more on how to start a project if I had seen that.

### Being a Community Member
  Thanks for helping me aginst my feelings of failure and dread.  I feel as well that our project taught us a lot.
  I think we should have talked and detailed more of a DTR than we did.  Primarily in the aspects of the time frames we planned
  to work together.  We ping ponged well and we made some great movements inbetween the hurdles.  You were seeing syntax errors 
  and a few other things along the same lines that I wasn't, if next time you could point that out and elaborate on it next time.
  I feel stronger after learning from this experience.

### Playing a Part
I reached out to people who needed pairing, helped others with their feelings towards projects and making them feel better about themsleves.
