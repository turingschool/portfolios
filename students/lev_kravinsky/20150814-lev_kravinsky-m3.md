#Lev Kravinsky - M3 Portfolio

###Individual

Areas of Emphasis

This module, I spent a lot of time on side projects. I also a little time working with Angular, and dove deeper into Ruby, learning about lambdas/procs, yield/block.call, Fiber/Thread, instance_eval, __send__, and Ruby's GIL. The last two weeks, I spent almost all of my free time working in Elixir. I also did a lot of networking and travelled to New York and San Francisco to meet with companies that interested me for interviews. In addition, I started a program for myself where I get coffee with someone who inspires me every week - so far, it has been a huge success and has been one of the single biggest aids to me in terms of programming ability, my job hunt, social skills, project ideas, etc. I think other people should try this out as well. I've also been invited to be a fellow at the Recurse Center this winter and my personal project is being used in a case study of 100 villages and 25 doctors in the Peruvian Amazon. I've so far been invited to speak at 3 conferences this year.

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Thursday, July 17th and Friday, July 18th, for PovertyHack2015, where I helped CUPeru win $5000.

###Projects
----
I participated in the following team projects:

https://github.com/levthedev/supper_skip

Feature Completion - 4
Project Organization - 4
Test-Driven Development - 4
Code Quality - 3.5
User Experience - 2

Jorge said our project 'had the best back end he'd seen all day', and our group had the highest cumulative score (17.5/20  - the average class score was 14.5) out of all of 1503. I had a really great time working with Max and Jamie too, this was one of the most pleasant groups I've worked with.


https://github.com/levthedev/gitflub

Server-Side Application and APIs: 2
Test-Driven Development: 3
Features: 3
Interface: 3

This project was very enjoyable and useful for me; I learned a ton about consuming an API, controller tests, VCR, and bootstrap. Plus, it set the stage for my personal project, where the majority of the work I did was dealing with an API.

https://github.com/levthedev/cuperu-api

This project was one of my favorite things I've built at Turing. User registration is done entirely through SMS, I finally got to use and understand a polymorphic relationship, and I got a chance to write an API in Elixir. Writing that API in Elixir was the most fun I've had while at Turing - I got to learn about functional programming, immuteable state, higher order functions, and all the little magic things that Rails gives us that we have to do by hand in other languages. Deploying a non Rails app to Heroku was cool too, and seeing response times that were 30-50x faster than my Rales Engine was very satisfying.

###Feedback to Me
----
Last module, some challenges that I encountered were trying to go too fast, not taking pomodoros, and not committing frequently enough. This module, I've attempted to slow down, and my peers seem to agree that I've improved in that area - my public speaking skills have improved a huge amount due to all the lightning talks I've given (I think it's like 10 or so now). I also now take pomodoros on every project I work on, and I now have both the most commits of anyone in 1503 and the longest streak.

###Community
----
On Friday, July 24th, I gave a live-coded, improvised lightning talk called 'Enumerator Playground'.
On the same day, I ran a student led session about reimplementing Enumerator and Enumerable.

On Friday, August 7th, I gave a live coded, improvised lightning talk called "Overthinking your first Ruby Class"
On the same day, I ran a mini student led session about creating Gems.
On the same day, I lead another mini session on workflow called the 10x Developer, about Shell/Vim/Heroku/Mac workflow.

On Friday, August 14th, I will give a lightning talk that is a modified version of my conference talk at Lone Star Ruby about concurrency.
On the same day, I am giving another lightning talk about the Elixir programming language.

I began constructing lesson plans with Regis for an Elixir elective that we will teach every week next module on Friday - I found the lack of continuous electives to be a huge gap in the Friday schedule, as I rarely ever learned anything iteratively and mostly learned tiny things about diverse subjects. This elective is an attempt to build upon knowledge every week of a totally different language than Ruby.

I've paired with Matt and Alon (1507) on their Sales Engine, Lovisa (1503) with her blogger project, Marla on her DinnerDash, Jack, Vane, Ricci, and Justin on their personal projects.

###Side Projects
----
I built a prototype SMS platform for Comunidades Unidas Peru, an NGO working to empower health care workers in the Peruvian Amazon.
I built a mocking gem (called Mock Lobster!) as a Mocha replacement, which I used in several of my projects that has ~2000 downloads.
I wrote a gem called rosetta-code - a simple web-scraper for rosettacode.org that currently has ~2000 downloads.
I did my personal project's API in Elixir and got down to microsecond response times.
I reimplemented Enumerator and Enumerable (and gave a conference talk about it).
I wrote a bunch of FizzBuzz solutions and benchmarked them to test class vs. instance methods, conditionals vs. cases, etc.
I made a live chat app using the MEAN stack.
