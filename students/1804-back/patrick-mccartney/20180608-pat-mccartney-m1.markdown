# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I came in blind without really understanding what to expect.  Hence I did not come in with predetermined specific goals, only general goals like "graduate", or "complete mod1",  These things were not constructive goals to have and i believe I will be better served next module by having smaller attainable goals that will eventually lead to the bigger picture goals of graduation/promotion.

## A: End of Module Assessment

N/A: repeat


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The projects were the hardest part of the module and the largest source of stress I had.  I spent at least 5 sleeplessness nights trying to get projects done on time.  This was due to poor planning and a failure to reach out and ask for help when I became stuck on things that seem so simple now.  I was unable to complete any of my individual projects to working functionality.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Mod1 I only worked on one paired project.  The experience was a helpful
introduction into working in a team environment.  I was able to identify several
areas I plan on improving on my next paired assignment: i.e. communication, more
in person work/coordination, to be more willing to ask for help,

This was one of the first projects assigned.  I was struggling to understand the basic concepts and the complexity of the project was both intimidating and challenging.  I was unable to build it to functionality

#### (Credit_Check)

Again, a project I was unable to build to completion.  As the speed of the module picked up I felt I was falling further and further behind of where I should have been.  Intimidation and stress levels kept rising and I was not processing that stress properly.

#### (battlehsip)

battleship completely broke me as a person.  I spent so much time stressing about how to start that I never even managed to get going into the meat of the project.  I relentlessly started without being sure of what I was doing, deleting what I did, and then starting over from scratch.  I was getting almost no sleep and by the last night before the project was due I was overcome by physical illness due to stress and was vomiting the whole evening.  I am planning to complete the project over the break and if i can complete it I believe I am good shape for the repeat.

## D: Professional Skills
My initial reaction to the PD sessions was to roll my eyes.  I thought that they were going to be just like the HR/sexual harassment sessions I have had to go through in my professional life.  As I am here now in week 6 facing the repeat of the first module I recognize how foolish I was.  I have begun to embrace the whole message here at Turing and I am already noticing the differences.

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)
The health and wellness session was the first one that we attended.  I did not take it seriously at the time.  Now however i see the importance of both physical and mental health in processing the stress associated with Turing.

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)
Diversity of opinion is a resource to be valued.  Without input and opinion from people with diverse backgrounds ideas are never going to be as effective or as far reaching as they could have been.  Such a simple thing as including people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and cultures, you will inevitably have better outcomes than from a single close minded group.

#### (Mod4 Gear Up)

The mod4 session was both engaging and entertaining.  The subject material was immediately relevant to both our careers in the near future and the impact the choices we make in those careers will effect the world.  AI is quickly becoming a staple of modern life from our GPS systems, smart phones, computers, cars.  It will slowly but surely be integrated completely into the American life-style and our actions will guide how that process happens.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was largely absent from the community for the most part this module.  This was one of my largest mistakes.  I did not use the community to help with projects or concepts I was struggling with and I also did not use my mentor to the fullest I could have.  Since choosing to repeat I have begun improving my community interaction through a slack channel for the other repeaters.  We have all been banding together to tackle the assigned exercises and helping each other when we become stuck.
