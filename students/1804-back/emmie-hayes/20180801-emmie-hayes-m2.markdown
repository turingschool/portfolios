# Emmie Hayes - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  - I had a couple of goals:
    - Engage more with Turing community
    - Be available as a resource to the students in Mod 1
    - Not let my perfectionism get in the way of self-confidence

  - I was successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  - Advanced ActiveRecord
  - Don't overthink it.
  - It helped me to read a problem before bed and solve it in the morning.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

 - I loved all of the projects in Mod 2.  The Rails Mini was my favorite because I really enjoyed working on something by myself that I feel passionate about.  It was also an opportunity to learn more about integrating a CSS framework.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?

 - Confidence.  Presenting our projects in Clarke Hall, with a microphone, in front of my predominately male classmates was a great experience for me.  My mentor also suggested that I participate in the code fair so I signed up on a whim.  Both experiences, along with the week I spent building out the project were confidence boosters.  I was very happy with my final project and look forward to adding more robust features in Mod 3.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

 - I like working in groups more than pairs.  There are more hands on deck and the possibilies seem endless.  Things are just better when more people are at the table.  Working in groups also encouraged more advanced usage of GitHub.  That was probably my biggest take away and favorite part... using GitHub how it was intended to be used.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

- Favorite: Priviledge session. Because it wasn't in Clarke Hall and it was unique to just our class.  I enjoyed having a conversational hour in the classroom.  It was relaxing.

- Least Favorite: The final sesson. I happened to be in the same topic that I was in during Mod 1 and it didn't offer much in comparison.  

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

- Attended the Code Demo
- Participated in the code fair
- Sat in on a student panel for the 1806 cohort
- Helped Mod 1 students when possible

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

- participate in more networking/outreach opportunities
