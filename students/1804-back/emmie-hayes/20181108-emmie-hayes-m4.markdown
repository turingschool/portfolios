# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

- Get comfortable working in at least one new language and framework.

## Technical Communication Assessment

- Pass

- I didn't have time to get nervous about this assessment. My strategy was to shoot from the hip, something I rarely do, and see what happened. I figured at the very least I would identify gaps in my knowledge prior to interviewing in the real world, which is exactly what happened. Gaps I need to fill: Cons of OOP and specifics between different types of tests. I plan on reviewing the fundamental bits of knowledge from MOD 1 prior to my interviews, it is only going to help.

## Quantified Self

- PART 1 (WK 1): My favorite project at Turing. Building a solid Rails back-end, thoroughly testing, implementing continuous integration and following my own work flow was a wonderful experience. Because we had an entire week to build I was able to take some time to learn more about Factory Bot and build a more dynamic test suite. I also didn't feel rushed in determining how to implement CI and auto deploy to Heroku, which made it easier to learn and appreciate.  The only issue I ran into was the final iteration, I got stuck in 'analysis-paralysis' when it came to using a PORO over a serializer to produce a highly customized json.  It was uncomfortable but in the end I was overjoyed with my approach.  I was reminded that there is such thing as overthinking it.  


- PART 2 (WK 2/3): This was designed to be a paired project but due to an odd number of students in my class, I got to work on my own. Working alone was the biggest reward and challenge because I didn't have someone to bounce ideas off of. Technically speaking, my biggest challenge was building the back-end in Express. I felt heavily relient on my notes from class and it felt very pieced together, there was no flow. A few days before the project was due we had a lecture on implementing MVC in Express and that changed everything.  Once I recognized the possibilities things really started to open up and the movement of the build took over.  It was a great opportunity for me to put a familiar structure to Express as well as the JS language. Three tech concepts I learned during this project include functional programming, cross origin resource sharing, and writing queries with knex. Where I was not able to finish the calculations of calories, my MVP was just as strong as my classmates who worked with a partner... for that, I felt momentarily satisfied. I look forward to finishing the project following graduation.


## Capstone Project

- Our biggest challenge was attempting to work with React inside of Rails.  For nothing more than experience, we choose to build out the Admin Dashboard in Rails with React components.  This ended up being a bad idea given the time frame.  It over complicated things which we later decided to build entirely in Rails.  It was a good experience in that we were forced to work through every element of the build together but it sucked because we didn't know how to test it and it created a bottleneck in our workflow. Functionality that could be built in minutes in Rails views took hours with React components and in the end we wasted a lot of time.  That said, on the other side of the project we had a Rails back-end with a React front-end and that build was new and exciting.  We did a lot of planning up front in order to meet the needs of our client which led to a great first experience with micro-services. We also integrated the Stripe API which was something none of us had ever done.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

- No one things stands out.  For me, having my instructors believe in me and my abilities more than I do, that's everything.  Whenever I start to doubt myself, I just remember their confidence in me- it reminds me to be myself, take a deep breath and keep trying.

## Gear Up

- To be honest, I was less than enthused to plan and lead a gear up session, MOD4 is incredibly hectic and it seemed to always find its way at the bottom of my priorities.  But like most things in my life, it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  I actually enjoyed leading the session.  It certainly helped that we had a small and receptive group of students who were willing to participate in our debate format with curiousity and class. I learned so much from the participants mainly but also, myself as a leader and the overall Turing culture. 


## Community Involvement

- I sat in on a couple of student panels prior to Mod 4 but other than that I was too busy to exist in the community. I am happy that I will get a chance to do more of it in the future by pairing with students and possibly becoming a mentor. 

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

- I care about the code I write and the work I do, a lot
- I test drive my development process
- I always persevere
