# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to learn about frameworks; about using what we had already learned to build something useful for other people. I think overall I did learn those things. Now I'm at the point where I want to add more, and more unique, functionality to my apps. I'm excited to take the next step and see what I can build moving forward.

### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The workload is tremendous. I was also elected project manager in all of my groups this mod, which was OK - but it's also an extra burden that comes with a certain amount of responsibility and accountability. Everyone feels that though, so it's not like it's a particularly unique feeling.

## Blog

### Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

Instructions for building a usable, decent looking UI by drawing wireframes, avoiding flex box hell, picking fonts and colors, using scss, and a quick intro to bootstrap for building navs and displays for data. Essentially, a setup guide for an OK looking app.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

### Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

Yes and no. I feel like we missed something fundamental when using active record, and I think it revolves around not having enough exposure or experience with SQL. While this was great exercise, I think also writing some of the queries in SQL would be extremely useful. I kind of feel like I was learning a language without knowing the alphabet.

## Projects

### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I actually enjoyed all of the projects this module. Building something with a UI and populating information from a database is totally my jam. I particularly enjoyed my rails mini, even though I probably poured the most hours into it. In retrospect it's also my least favorite because I realized after the fact how much better it could have been. I also enjoyed Job tracker and bike share because I was able to incorporate some data visualizations, which I think it an important and fundamental part of building a proper front end for data analysis.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned all about auth! It was pretty great to be introduced to it in such a fluid and casual way. It also happened to be particularly relevant to the problem my app was trying to solve, so it gave it more impact when it did work.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?

That everyone really strives to do their best. That sounds a little cheesy, but it's important to keep that in mind at Turing. Sometimes 14 or 15 hour days make us grouchy(that's putting it a little mildly) and we can take it out on others. We can blame a broken test on somebody else, or lash out when something doesn't work on heroku. But for the most part, everyone is giving it everything they have - that's a good reminder about the Turing experience, be nice even when you don't feel like it.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was an SAB rep. I also assisted with teaching mod 1 about sorting cards (but that was mainly Angela, she's awesome). I'm also just an overall swell dude.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Since I'll be leaving SAB after serving my two innings I'd like to join a posse! I would also like to save some energy to continue assisting module 1 and 2 students when issues arise, even if I can't solve them - I can at least take some time to listen.
