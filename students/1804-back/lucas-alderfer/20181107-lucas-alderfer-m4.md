# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I was excited to come into this module and learn as much as I could about the way that JavaScript functions because of how popular it is.

## Quantified Self Rails
  I believe that this project was helpful in order to not only refresh me on how rails worked as a monolith, but provided for me a fresh context for how hard it can be to make pleasant to use front ends without external frameworks in Rails.  The primary challenge was, after being exposed to the power of JS in the prework, then being left without it in the next project.

## Technical Communication Assessment (Mock Interview?)

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
  Speaking in a concise enough manner to be appropriate for an interview setting.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  Emulating the interview environment, it is much more helpful to me to go through the practice in a less comfortable setting.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Pretend I don't know Amy, answer the questions as a professional, not as a student.

* What did you learn?
  If you are not prepared to answer questions to some level of specificity, you will not be direct enough in answering.


## Quantified Self (Full-Stack)

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  Debugging mistakes in JS, the process is very different from how I approach debugging in Ruby/Rails.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Console.log.  An inelegant series of printing out certain values through the execution of my code to determine the pieces that were not working as intended.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  Seeing how easy it is to make applications react dynamically to a user in a more applicable setting.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  Asynchronous execution, using JQuery to alter displayed HTML, How to include work from other JS files in one place.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  My Javascript coding was not test driven, which, though I hear is common, made me feel as though I was just throwing code at my problems until it worked without an understanding of what was making it work.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  Very helpful, JP is inquisitive, insightful, polite, good at teaching, and brighter than I am, which are all qualities that contribute to a partner that is conducive to a good learning environment.

## Cross-Polination

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  Figuring out how to set up the environment to work with Devise, and the separate Front End.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  It took plenty of research online, attempting to describe as specifically as possible what I was trying to do and what errors I was getting to find other people on the internet who had already solved the issues I was having.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  I liked being exposed to React and the way in which it works with JS to, from my untrained perspective, create the illusion of OOP within JS through use of a framework based around the concept of components, which appeared to be class-type structures.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  I learned a lot about Devise and its implementation which is a popular security tool.  I also learned about database design through failing to initially set up my own in an efficient way.  I also feel that I gained a lot of comfort with deployment and production environments through struggling with Heroku for a long time on this project in order to make sure that my deployed backend was working properly.

## Final API Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What API did you work with?
NewsApi

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
I wanted to create a monolithic Rails application in order to refresh my skills and create a cleaner more to the point application consuming an API than I had in the past to solidify my knowledge.  However, having been working so extensively in JS frontends, working without JS in the creation of the UX/UI and display features was frustrating as I was unable to create the experience that I wanted without implementing other languages, which I was attempting to avoid.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  Ultimately my approach was stubbornness about abandoning my strict Rails concept, which did not lead to a solution but rather, a poorer app.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  It has been a long while since working solo, and it also helped to solidify my appreciation for JS.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  Google OAuth I had not previously used, it was fairly simple and felt seemless in integration.  I had not previously used a CodePen to inspire my styling, but it took a lot of pain out of the process.  I wrapped the information coming from my API calls in POROs identical in design to a table in my database for ease of saving the objects, a strategy I had been introduced to previously but not implemented, it felt very elegant to me.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
  Squash those ReadMe commits.  I am going to start doing it because it looks bad.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
I did not enjoy the experience.  It was challenging working with a group whose attentions were so sporadically drawn to the topic.  I certainly understand the motive behind getting student to plan the gearup across built in time on Fridays, it seems like something students would suggest, however the consequences were that despite chronicling our thoughts and decisions, sending them on slack, and reminding the group, each week we met the team decided to change the goals and content of the project such that I ultimately threw my hands up and let them tell me what to talk about the week of the gear up since they obviously had no interest in planning it in advance. The most rewarding part of the GearUp was that I think we were at least able to give the impression that we cared and thought the advice we were providing was good.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I attempted to be a part of two different NASA hackathon teams this mod, one for myself, the other to help with a concept I believed I could help with.  I think that helping others makes you feel more invested in the community, and being helped, likewise, ultimately leading to a more inviting and inclusive community that cares about its own ends and those of each of its members.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Good Documentation, perhaps not the technical markdown, but the writing and readability.
Concretly predetermined goals with respect to what should be completed at what time, EllenMary has shown by example the ways in which this can take a distracted and uninterested workforce and corrale it into modest proficiency.
A lack of complacency when it comes to having tested code.

## Professional Development

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

What is right?  That sentence may be the driving force to who I am and how I have moved through life. My first passion, Mathematics, gave me answers, each solution was the right one for the question asked. However, room to ask that question and hear answers to it were vast and welcome in Philosophy and History and I quickly shifted my focus to those fields in college. I was told that someone driven by that question should be in Law, so I wanted to learn more and took a job as a Legal Research Assistant, however that role provided me little of what I was interested in and when I was offered a role on the finance team, I jumped at it.  Much of finance is driven by deciding and doing what is right, SAP and GAAP reporting, pricing fairly, refunding, payment terms and invoicing, I could see justice in my work.  However, it was the role and not the company that I was enjoying, and when offered the chance to help start a new company I again, leaped towards an opportunity to take what I was doing and do more.  Like most start ups, we quickly ran into financial troubles, but not before I spent many hours of time conversing with our software developers, speaking about what we wanted to do, why, and how they could do it.  What is the right way to build this? What is the right way to provide this service? There wasn't and isn't an answer.  What cannot be done, what can?  To a certain extent, the answers, the way they were given, its limitlessness and openness and the reliance on justification reminded me of Philosophy with one major exception.  Software is applied solutions and not a discussion of possible solutions.  In short I was driven to software because it is needed in every company, and not only can and should you ask 'What is Right?' everyday before you code, you then get to use your decision to make something that impacts people.  I do not know exactly what is next for me, but I want to make decisions, defend them, and then implement them, and move to the next decision I need to make.

* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
