# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this module, which I repeated, I set out to understand completely the techniques
of solving programming based problems, as well as understand ruby. I feel like
I achieved about an 85% of this goal, maybe lower.

You know how to tell Ruby to do what you want - I'd like to see you push
yourself to maximize the power of Ruby and do it more efficiently,
with cleaner code.

(feedback to me)
Chris was an amazing partner for this project, he listened to my feedback and was really great in helping me understand concepts that I didn't understand during encryption and decryption, he also worked on the project while he was away, I really appreciated him being my partner and having the patience to work with me. I wouldn't have anything to say he could improve on, he was an amazing person to work with. the only thing both of us could work on would be to get more comfortable with using git and github but that comes with time and we would get better as we continue to use it.

#### (Black Thursday)

## D: Professional Skills
As a repeater I was not required to participate in these sessions.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this mod I made plenty of friendships and helped people
in the beginning with the knowledge I had from the previous iteration.
The iteration was full of some very adept minds so the tables turned after
approximately week 3, and I found myself asking them for answers. I feel this
interaction is more like the world of software development, there is no one
person who has the answers to everything and asking for advice is paramount.
