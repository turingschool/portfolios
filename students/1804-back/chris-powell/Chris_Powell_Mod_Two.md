# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I set out to assimilate all the information in the module. I was only about
  70 percent successful. I believe I can employ all the information presented
  in module two but in terms of assimilation I don't embody it 100%.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled most with the timed exercises. I learned that I need to work more
  efficiently under the pressure of the clock. I also struggled a lot with active
  record but that got better near the end of the module. I suppose what I learned
  from my struggle with active record is that I really enjoy it, when it works.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

  https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom-5/pull/29 

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

  This was extrememly helpful. It was very hard to complete at firts but by the
  end I felt way more confident about approaching problems which required active
  record solutions.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

    My favorite project in this module was the Rails Mini project. It was a
    pleasure putting my own ideas into a project and seeing them come into
    fruition.
    My least favorite project was Job Tracker but that is only because it was a
    real struggle at the time and kept me up for many nights.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

    I learned how to turn an abstract idea into something usable. With the
    predetermined projects all the instructions are there but with the independent
    project you have to sketch it out completely on your own.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

    I learned how to manage a workload for a project that had 2 or more people
    working on it. I learned how to work with people fairly and how to declare
    my own needs in terms of collaboration. Finally, I learned how to employ the
    agile approach in order to produce a well tested, well implemented and
    well reviewed project.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

    Outside of my own module I didn't contribute much. I helped some mod one students
    but not as much as I planned on in the beginning.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

    Typically I would like to be more on top of the information. I would love to
    be one of the members of the class who could help others out. I also need to
    be more friendly so people feel comfortable talking to me. In short I would
    like to contribute more to myself so I can contribute more to others.
