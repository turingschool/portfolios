# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I wanted to learn all the things. Specifically I wanted to learn how ruby is used in the real world, and I think I have a good basic understanding of how that works now.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
As far as topics of instruction go I struggled most with ActiveRecord and SQL. I learned to stick with it until I get it. In a broader sense, though, I struggled with lack of confidence. My own doubts about my abilities severely messed up my performance on more than one occasion.


## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

My blog post is about the steps I go through to start a new rails project. It's not quite five minutes but is just over 1000 words so I feel ok about it.


## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Link your finished ActiveRecord Obstacle Course here.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
I did learn quite a bit by doing this.  I feel like I could have used more practice on basic stuff before I had to do the harder stuff but at least I think I learned it.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I really liked and learned a lot from all of them. I particularly enjoyed my mini-project, because I didn't have to confer with anyone on decisions and I could move at my own pace. I guess my least favorite was Little Shop, because I was still super new to this and didn't feel confident I knew what I was doing. Overall though, I really like the projects.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I gained a deeper understanding about why rails stuff works the way it does. I also learned a lot of CSS stuff.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to work in a group - how to manage workflow, how to use git with a bigger team, how to properly (or at least better) use a management tool - all kinds of useful stuff.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I helped a whole bunch of Mod 1 people, and I participated a little in JCS.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to do more mentoring of lower mod students and do more JCS stuff.
