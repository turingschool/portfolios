# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* This mod I set out to get comfortable building basic Rails apps and I feel successful in that regard.  I understand the basics well and can build basic apps fairly quickly and effectively.  I also wanted to get comfortable using database and I feel like I have still have some work to do in that department.  I hope to look into SQL some more of break to feel more comfortable going into mod 3.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* Database queries are still a struggle for me. I find it hard to visualize what's going on behind the scenes and feel lost at times.  I also struggles with group projects at times.  I realized I need to get better at communication and setting realistic expectations for my group members.  I also learned that sometimes I just need to focus on myself and what I can do rather than worrying about others.

## Blog

[Packages to Improve Your Atom Experience](https://medium.com/@colinwarmstrong/packages-to-improve-your-atom-experience-8f7f475a4f11)

* I wrote a short blog about a few Atom packages I use that I've found to be helpful.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

[Completed ActiveRecord Obstacle Course](https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/storedom-5)

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

* This was extremely helpful for practicing ActiveRecord and is one of the main reasons I am somewhat competent as using ActiveRecord.  It would be cool if there was something like this for SQL.  Or maybe put some SQL practice into this obstacle course.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite project this mod was Job Tracker.  It was my first time using Rails and I feel like I learned a lot.  I feel like it set me up with a good base knowledge of Rails for the rest of the mod.  My partner was also extremely hardworking and dedicated and the project turned out better than I expected.  We also got the project done fairly early which led to a less stress.

* My least favorite project this mod was Little Shop.  My group was pretty dysfunctional and the project didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  I felt like I was the only group member who was capable of doing large portions of the project which was put a lot of stress on me.  It also led to a couple of late nights trying to get everything done which led to even more stress.  Overall, it was a very frustrating and stressful project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* My Rails Mini did not go as well as I had planned but I had fun trying to implement my own ideas.  I learned a lot about styling apps and utilizing many-to-many relationships.  It was also cool to present a project to my classmates.


What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I got much better at communicating via slack and using project management tools during the group projects this mod.  I also feel like my git workflow is much improved this mod.  Group projects seem much less daunting and I feel better at planning things out and coordinating multiple people.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* My biggest contribution to the Turing community this module was mentoring a mod 1 student.  I was really excited when a mod 1 student reached out to me to see if I was interested in mentoring her once a week. It was really nice to help out another student and also a good opportunity to revisit the mod 1 concepts.  I also feel like I was able to provide guidance and advice to a number of my fellow classmates throughout this mod.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* Next mod, I would like to join a posse. I would also like to mentor some more lower mod students as it was one of the more rewarding experiences I've had so far at Turing.
