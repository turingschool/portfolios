## A: End of Module Assessment

(passed)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(I feel that I progressed over the course of my individual projects.  I also feel that I was always short one step on each project of it being what it should be.  I got the feeling like "if only I had one more day" by the end of each project.)

#### (Mastermind)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wehttamclan/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

(You are to build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface.)

(In runner, your objects don't instance variables
Some of your classes can be condensed into one class
Correct elements should be broken into helper methods)

()

#### (Sorting Cards)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wehttamclan/sorting_cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

(In this project, you will write a program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see cards, guess what the card is, and sort the cards.)

(Overall clean
used bubble sort
be careful with testing)

(1. Ruby Syntax & Style
3: Meets expectations
2. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Meets expectations
3. Test-Driven Development
3: Meets expectations
4. Functionality
3: Meets expectations)

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wehttamclan/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

(In this project, you will write a program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see cards, guess what the card is, and sort the cards.)

(Great style, loved some of the decisions you made and the way you were able to articulate them
Would like to see many more commits and some feature branches!)

(1. Ruby Syntax & Style - 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components -3
3. Test-Driven Development - 3
4. Functionality - 3
5. Version Control - 2)


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wehttamclan/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

(In this project youâ€™ll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.)

(Don't add commits after the deadline
Don't push breaking code into master
Shouldn't hard code tests to only work with today's date
You are ignoring the optional date variable passed to encrypt and decrypt methods
Don't have @characters and @char_map. If an IVar can be easily calculated, it doesn't need to be an instance variable)

(1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 1
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 1
4. Git Workflow: 2
5. Functionality: 1)

(feedback to me)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

(This helped me put into context my stress and how symptoms manifest and how to recognize them.  I eventually came to really like pom breaks, and this gear up session introduced them to me.)

### Gear Up
#### (Code 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

(This gear up had a good discussion session.  Sharing our experiences was enlightening and shaped my views on topics of diversity and make up of our current cohort and industry wide.  Considering how diversity impacts people's work and its outcomes has changed the way I approach my work.)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(This is an area I have a lot of room for improvement.  I was caught up in my own schedule, school work, commute, getting used to working at Turing that I didn't join any posses or other extra curricular activities.  The best I can say is that I was a good neighbor; keeping my area in class clean, cleaning my dishes, loading and unloading the dishwasher.)
