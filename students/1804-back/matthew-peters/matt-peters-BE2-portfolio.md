# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to get better at git workflow and TDD.  Still very much a work in progress, but I feel like I made a ton of progress in TDD to the point it actually drives my code.  Git workflow is still very shaky, but it's less of a hinderance now and more of a tool.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Working in groups bigger than two people was slightly challenging at first.  I'm used to working side by side with someone on one computer, and it was difficult at first not having someone feel like a third wheel.  It eventually came down to changing our workflow.  Waffle.io helped a lot with that.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Yes.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorites:
Mini Rails project - It was nice to work at my own pace, make unilateral decisions, and play around with the code without having to stress about grades and deadlines.  

Least favorite:
Little-Shop - Not a fan of Sinatra.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
Setting up an API.  Solidified a lot of rails concepts we learned on the previous project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Learning how to work with more than one parter posed some challenges mentioned above.  The paired projects with only two group members worked well.  It was the first time I've paired remotely.  We made good strides in remote workflow too.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I attended the machine learning posse but just observed what was being talked about.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to actually participate in a posse next mod.
