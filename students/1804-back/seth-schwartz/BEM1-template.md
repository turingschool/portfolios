# Seth Schwartz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At the most basic level, I wanted to build a solid understanding of programming and of the ruby language.  Being it that I was repeating the module I was able to identify a lot of my weaknesses prior to starting the module this time.  I wanted to understand what I was being taught including syntax, methods, data types(specifically classes, arrays, hashes), specs and grasping the concept of the projects.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I was able to successfully setup and initialize all the classes and get all the methods up to the last one of I2 working.  I then had trouble checking the shopping list as I was adding a hash to hash.  I tried multiple enumerables to extract the information out of the first hash but wasn't successful in doing so.  After it was due, I received help from a classmate and understood how to properly extract the information by using inject with the new hash and adding the key and value by index since when iterating through a hash it creates arrays of the key-value pairs.  I then was able to complete a couple more methods by myself.  I am frustrated and disappointed on my outcome of the final assessment as I know I am a better programmer than my final product demonstrates.  I have identified my weakness of using enumerables on hashes and will do additional practice to improve.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Compared to last module, my sentiments on timed assessments and projects are much more positive.  Whereas last module I couldn't even understand specs and what we were supposed to be building, this time I was able to with much greater ease. I was able to complete more of the projects/timed assessments with less help from others.

I felt confident on the mid mod, final paired and all the timed assessments aside from the final.  Credit check felt simple this time around however I learned not to treasure map.  Sorting cards went smoothly, however, the last two methods were challenging.   Battleship was very difficult as I am more comfortable in writing programs derived from TDD where as battleship was a REPL and required a lot of user input which is difficult to test.  

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/SSchwartz214/credit_check_v1
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check

Description:

The Luhn algorithm is a check-summing algorithm best known for checking the validity of credit card numbers.

You can checkout the full description on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm
The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This full account number must pass the following test:

from the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit
if product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
take the sum of all the digits
if and only if the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid

Evaluation comments:
  Avoid treasure mapping

#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/SSchwartz214/sorting_cards
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards

Description:

In this project, you will write a program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see cards, guess what the card is, and sort the cards.

In order to build good habits, we’ve broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

Evaluation scores:
  Ruby Syntax & Style: 4
  Breaking Logic into Components: 3
  Test-Driven Development: 2.5/3.5
  Functionality: 3

Evaluation comments:
  More edge case testing

#### Battleship

  * [GitHub URL] https://github.com/SSchwartz214/battleship
  * [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

  Description:

  In this project you’ll use Ruby to build an implementation of the classic game Battleship.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Enigma was a good challenge which my partner and I rose too.  We were able to implement encyption, decryption and file IO.  We developed good team work and built a solid project. Black Thursday took many hours but I gradually understood more and more and finally grasped the connections between all the classes.  My partner and I worked well as a team.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/SSchwartz214/enigma
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma

Description:

You are to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages. Additionally, your program will need to read messages from and output them to the file system.

Evaluation scores
  Ruby Syntax & Style: 2
  Breaking Logic into Components: 3
  Test-Driven Development: 2
  Git Workflow: 3
  Functionality: 2

#### Black Thursday

  * [GitHub URL] https://github.com/SSchwartz214/black_thursday
  * [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday

  Description:

  A business is only as smart as its data. Let’s build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

## D: Professional Skills
  Gaining from prior jobs/experiences I have developed strong professional skills.  I demonstrated this when speaking to classmates, mentors, instructors.  I am in the process of updating my LinkedIn to reflect my new skillset and education experience.

### Gear Up
Week 1: Health & Wellness, Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap, and the Week 5 choice session
#### (Health & Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Very valuable to learn about stress and ways to control it during time at Turing.
Was interesting learning about the different types of stress (eustress and
distress).  It was helpful discussing ways to deal with stress such as nature
exposure, exercise, and meditation.  I continue to use the information I learned
in this gear up.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Another interesting gear up that brought awareness the gender gap that exists
in the tech world as well as American society.  This gear up taught me to include
everyone, believe people's stories and stand up for everyone's rights.

#### (Biohacking)

I thoroughly enjoyed this gear up as I worked in the health field prior to Turing.
I found it fascinating the technology that has been developed and how it can help
people.  This gear up sparked my interest in health tech and it would be a field
I would consider working in.

## E: Community Participation / Playing a Part

  I viewed all the presenters projects during the code fair and voted.  I participated in the staff vs student basketball game.  I continue to meet with alumni to pair.

------------------

## Final Review

I gained tons of knowledge this time around.  Lecture material stuck, timed assessments and projects made sense and I developed a strong foundation in Ruby and programming.  I enjoyed and had fun learning this time.  I am grateful that I was able to repeat as I feel like a completely different person this time around.  Theres still so much I want to learn and improve on but I feel that I now have a solid foundation to build upon.
