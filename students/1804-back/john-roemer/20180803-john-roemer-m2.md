# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Use the knowledge I gained in mod 1 to make webapps using ruby and rails. I think I was successful. I learned a lot more about databases than I thought I would which is cool!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Qerying the database and understanging Authentication. I learned how to handle authentication with the session and understand it well now. I feel like advnaced querying of databases is something I will continue to work on for a period of time longer than Turing.

## Blog

[Letâ€™s install linux on my windows 10 box.] (https://medium.com/@jtr022/lets-install-linux-on-my-windows-10-box-fcb4329196d1)

  I explored the Windows Subsystem for Linux on my PC at home.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

[ActiveRecord Obstacle Course] (https://github.com/jtrtj/storedom-5)

I found it to be mostly helpful but more as an introduction. I definitely don't feel 100% comfortable with AR but I feel aware of what it does.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Of course the rails mini was great becaue I got to design something from the ground up.

I also enjoyed working on something with 3 other people in BikeShare. It was difficult to hold it together in the last week but I did enjoy the responsibility of being the project manager. It was awesome to see my plan of attack for the user stories fall into place.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

How important front-loading the schema design is. I wasted a lot of time redesigning the tables. This project was also a great opportunity to explore and get more comfotable with CSS and CSS frameworks.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Starting to learn how to divide up work but still unsure sometimes. It still feels very productive to pair especially ping-pong-pairing when one person writes the test then the other implements code to make it pass. I had to carry a lot of the workload in my paired projects which feels good now but in the moment it was very stressful. I know that one day I will be the one in the group who needs to be lifted up.

I also think that the time spent learning sinatra to make Little Shop Redux could have been better spent just learning about SQL and ActiveRecord queries. I feel that if by the end of Mod2 I understand rails and its interactions with HTTP enough to undertand what Sinatra does even if I never made a project in it.

If I could go back, I would have studied only SQL for the entire break leading up to Mod2.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I showed my app Chromotherapy in the code-fair which was awesome. I really enjoyed getting the feedback from students who don't know me. I also enjoyed showing it to Mod1 students who are intimidated by Mod2. I think I helped at least two feel better about moving on.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to join a posse and regularly attend. Considering starting a film club posse.
