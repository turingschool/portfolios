## Areas of Emphasis
  1 ) What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
    I wanted to make sure to understand and progress throughout the module and build my knowledge and understanding from day one to the final one.
    I wanted to be able to create my own "app" and seeing that message "Yay you are on rails" was great ! I really like working with database so I am really impatient to study more SQL.
    And I want to go to mod 3.
    I have persevere and work every single day to my maximum ! Making sure to pair or ask questions (I can do even better on this topic but I try). I have follow your advice about redoing the code challenge and making sure to read the spec carefully.

  2 ) What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
    I was confuse by switching back and forth between SQL and ActiveRecord especially because of the syntax not necessarily "the logic". I paired with Jude so from the first week he was asking me to write my "method in SQL before to write it in ActiveRecord which was helpful.
    I learn that it is ok to not be comfortable at first.

##Blog
Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

I wrote about Testing with Rspec in Rails and how it helps building our app step by step as Rspec acts like a "guide" if we follow and read carefully the error. Also, of course, by writing correct test.

##ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Yes, it was really helpful. I wish we would have had more method where we would have used more complicated query : such as select/group/order chain together with alias.

##Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My least favorite project was for sure Little Shop Redux probably because of Sinatra and being the first project so not being comfortable with the new tools.
My favorite was the mini project and Bike-Share. I wish I would have feel more comfortable with the tools and contents to do my own project (idea) I think mine was too big. I really like Bike share because of the combination data and shop.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I was glad to have been able to practice Authorization and also Authentication.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to use Bulma and keep our html dry by using partials (I have a tendency to wait later on to do that and then I end up not having time to do it). And just having everything we learned finally coming together.

##Community
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I went to the Demo night and it was really nice to see students presenting their app/projects and having Professional(people from the industry asking them questions and giving them "feedback").
Also, I started to go to the Joan Clark group but I did not pursue.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to go to a Demo night again to hear students AND profesional (I think it is helpful for us or at least it will be later on).
