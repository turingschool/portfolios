## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?  
  
This module set out to learn how to make rails applications quickly and efficiently. I feel that I was successful in my goal. On the final and the last 2 code challenges before it, I have either completed all the user stories or completed all but 1 of them. My speed has increased a lot. I find myself doing things without even having to think about it now. When I see an error message I will see it and usually know exactly where to go in my file structure to fix it. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?  
  
The thing that was most difficult for me this module was doing advanced active record queries. I also had trouble with sql queries since we didn't spend that much time on it. This taught me how to use resources online to figure out how to do advanced queries. Usually I would learn by taking a query from online, play around with it for a while, see what worked and what didn't. Basic queries I learned from the docs but when they get more advanced, there are limited examples on the documentation. I also learned that practice helps a lot. Doing the active record obstacle course helped me a lot to understand how active record methods acted, especially when chained with other active record methods.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?  
  
This was very helpful for practicing active record. I now feel pretty comfortable with everything included in this obstacle course.  

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?  
  
My favorite project was the rails mini because it allowed me to have more freedom and make more decisions about what I wanted my website to look like. I learned a lot during that project about authorization, authentication, and namespacing. I learned how important it was to move admin actions to an admin controller. It was cool to be able to make buttons and forms that were only available to certain users. I get more motivated about a project when I can see it as something that someone could actually use. This made it easy for me to put a ton of time and effort into it.  
My least favorite project was the little shop project at the beginning of the mod. I felt very overwhelmed because it was a much larger project that I was used to coming in and I had just learned the mvc model. That was the only project where I really thought that we were not going to finish because of various reasons. In the end through a lot of hard work I finished the project and it turned out really well. I learned a lot about how important project management is and the importance of setting expectations early.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?  
  
The independent project was great. As I said before, it allowed me to expand my learning by taking what I knew and going in a direction that I wanted with it. I learned a lot about authentication, authorization, namespacing, and styling. I ended up spending a lot of time on my project and it really paid off. It looked great, it worked well, and I was able to show it off to my classmates and even my family afterwords.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?  
  
I learned a lot from my paired projects. I got to experience the negatives of bad project management and the positives of using project management tools correctly. In the first project we were very unorganized, never on the same page, and not contributing equally. The second paired project was easier because we front loaded everything and were together most of the time communicating in person about what needed to be done. The last paired assessment is where I really learned how useful project management tools like waffle are. Because we had three people in our group and we all had different schedules, using waffle made it easier to coordinate work. Making waffle cards allowed everyone to work at their own pace and showed the other group members what the person was working on at all times. We were strict about having pull requests reviewed and always made sure to pull the master before pushing to our branches. It helped minimize merge conflicts and made sure we were never fixing merge conflicts on the github website. I will continue to use tools like this in the future.  

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?  
  
I contributed to the turing community by helping module 1 students that needed help with their projects. I know how hard module 1 was so I tried to make myself available to help people by introducing myself and telling students I am willing to help. I also contributed to the community by going to the code demo and supporting turing students who spent a lot of time and effort on their projects. It was cool to see what students in other mods have been doing with their time and see it come to fruition.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?  
  
Next module I would like to attend the code demo again. I enjoy going to them and I know the students involved appreciate the support. I would also like to start regularly attending a posse. I only went to the machine learning posse once this mod because I have been busy but I would like to attend more regularly. I would also like to help mod 1 and 2 students more when I am in mod 3.
