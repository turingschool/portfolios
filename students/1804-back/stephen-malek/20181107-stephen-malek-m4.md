# Stephen Malek - Module 4 Portfolio Presentation
  
## Greatest Achievement 
* What was your biggest achievement of the module?  
My biggest achievement was being able to learn a new language (JavaScript) and framework (Express.js) in a very short amount of time. During the Quantified Self calorie tracking app project I created a Back-End and Front-End app entirely with JavaScript. It was difficult at first but because I put the time in to really learn it, it payed off. I now enjoy it and am excited to learn about all the other Back-End and Front-End frameworks that use JavaScript. 

  
## Greatest Struggle 
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?  
My biggest achievement also provided me with the most struggle. During the Quantified Self project, while I was struggling at first learning JavaScript, my partner already had experience in the language and was pushing ahead immediately. It ended up causing an unequal distribution of work being done by each partner. Since the project was near finished already I talked with my partner and I decided I would build my own Back-End Express app on my own to gain any experience that I may have missed out on. He was very understanding and receptive. I am glad this happened in the end because I feel that I learned a valuable lesson. On top of gaining more Express experience, I learned how important communication is and to always give feedback in a specific, kind, and actionable way. People are usually very receptive to that.

## Setting Myself Apart
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?  
I feel that the application I made for the take home final was impressive for the amount of time we were given to complete it. Along with using the Marvel API for users age 12 and under to search characters, series, and add favorites through authentication, I added a matching card game built entirely with Front-End JavaScript. I made the whole app in 4 days and I was surprised how much easier and faster this project was to complete compared to past projects of similar size. I put in a lot of time and was happy with the result. I may even put the project in my resume.  

## Front End Technologies  
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?  
Our exposure to more front end technologies this mod was great. Learning interesting things I can do with JavaScript on the front end made me appreciate the power of it. Also, working with Front-End students through the cross pollination project had me asking a lot of questions about React.js and interested to learn more once I have time post graduation. It made me realize that I like working on both the Front-End and the Back-End so any job that would allow me to learn and do both would be great for me. Having to create both the Front-End and Back-End seperately also gave me more experience on setting up your environment correctly to allow this design. 

## Skill Takeaway
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?  
I know that I am not always going to know everything about every technology or framework. Turing has given me the confidence that even if I don't know something I can figure out how to do it quickly and without anyone holding my hand. That being said I have learned from Turing to be humble about my knowledge because there is always more to know especially in the tech industry.  
## Gear up Takeaway
* What was your biggest takeaway from Gear Ups while at Turing? How has that impacted you and how will it impact you and your co-workers when you are on the job?  
The biggest thing I took away from the Gear Ups at Turing is to never assume something about someones experience. Everyone comes from a different background, culture, and no one was brought up exactly the same way. When you assume things about someone of a certain race, sex, gender, etc. it brings people further apart. You should listen to people when they share their struggles and support them because you can't possibly know what someone else has been through since every persons experience is unique.
