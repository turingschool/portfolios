# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- I became much more familiar with ORMs, and the interactions that occur between databases

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- I found that some active record queries could be extremely difficult, to the point
where even after having done them, I feel the need to practice (advanced) queries more often.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).
- https://medium.com/@tristan0bambauer/unicode-and-why-its-important-to-you-54e578af5c18
- My topic is about the use of Unicode and how languages can be encoded to be interpreted

ActiveRecord Obstacle Course (https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom-5/pull/21)
 - I believed this to be very helpful with my understanding of database queries as well as
 a resource to reference when I encounter similar problems with databases in the future.
 - I do submit that I think it would have been better to delve into SQL prior to learning
 ActiveRecord, an opinion that I believe a few other students share, but other than that, I found it very useful!


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite was easily the rails mini project, it was great being able to find out
my weaknesses and strengths in an individual project.  
- My least favorite was probably bikeshare: I felt as though a group of four is too big,
and that I didn't get enough work in some areas that I wanted to. I enjoyed working with my group, but found myself wishing that I had less partners so that I could learn more.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- A lot. I learned how to better budget my time (even for styling - my biggest weakness)
- I also utilized 'dream-driven development,' and I've found it to be immensely helpful
when developing my code

What did you learn from your paired projects?
- Waffle.io was totally underutilized by me, but that has (gradually) changed throughout the mod
- I work much better in a group when all together, as opposed to working separately from a distance
- It's important to assert yourself in projects and pursue the tasks you want to complete, so that you have the opportunity to get better at them.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* Favorite gear-up: Storytelling. I think it's great that students get to practice a way they can distinguish themselves from other candidates.
  - it's also a great way to get to know other students' better, as well as gain insight from their perspective
* Least favorite gear-up: Feedback II. I think giving honest feedback is a lot more difficult
than it seemed in this simulation.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I helped some mod ones with their work, I also supported the wellness and fitness posse!

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would definitely like to do more pairing with mods above and beneath me
* I also hope to try and have a lightning talk next mod
