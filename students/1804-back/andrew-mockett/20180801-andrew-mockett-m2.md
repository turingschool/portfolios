# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* I set out to learn rails and improve my abilities in Postgres - Most of my db experience was with Mongo (ugh).

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* The many-to-many relationship, obviously.  But not even conceptually, I fully understood the concept and why we do it that way.  I just assumed knowing the concept means I can implement it - which was clearly wrong.  What I learned is that I am beyond the point in this course where I can sort of "cruise" through the material.  I've definitely learned a lot so far, but this was something I needed to sit down and practice - and I'm not used to it.  I did force myself to practice, and put in ridiculous hours to learn, and I feel like it paid off.  I just need to keep this mindset going into Mod 3, since this will be entirely new.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).
* I wrote about how TDD makes my life easier: I have to think less and the code is better too. https://medium.com/@califormula/how-i-was-converted-into-loving-test-driven-development-f58cf7129ee1

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Link your finished ActiveRecord Obstacle Course here.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
* It was, however I think it would have been easier to learn SQL first, then ActiveRecord.  Overall a great exercise.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* I'd have to go with BikeShare.  The size of it was intimidating, and working with 4 people was difficult at first, but I feel like this is as close to a production-level project as I've gotten.  Managing the project was almost more important than writing the code, having regular meetings with the group, etc.  It was a lot of work but I enjoyed it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* How much I overestimate my abilities to complete a project in a certain amount of time.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* How to work with Tristan, who's great.  We fell a bit behind, and he kept a fire under me to keep me focused and on track.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I feel like I helped people with the concepts behind MVC and a server in general, as well as a DB.  That didn't last long though, the entire class caught up and passed me quickly.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* Study api-only backends, I want to try and build one during the break (I have a lot of project ideas for the break...  none of them will get finished).  I feel like I could help others with that once I know it - but at this point everything I'm learning is new to me, so I don't have a lot to offer in terms of experience going forward.

## Self-Assessment Scores

* Only giving myself a 4 on the Final Timed because I was very nervous about it, and I exceeded my own expectations.

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Category                     | Score |

| **Group Projects**           |   3   |
| **Professional Development** |   3   |
| **Community**                |   3   |
| **Final Written**            |   3   |
| **Final Timed**              |   4   |
