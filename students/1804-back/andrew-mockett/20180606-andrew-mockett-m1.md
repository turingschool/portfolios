# Andrew Mockett - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to get back into the routine of learning, solving challenging
code problems, and creating more structure and accountability in my life.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here are the projects I completed individually this module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MacInnes/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

Mastermind simulated a game of mastermind through a REPL.

* count variable is ambiguous
* don't need to save return value of format win to output variable
* Make matching colors and positions two separate methods
* opportunities for refactoring in runner
* Missing tests for random and format win

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MacInnes/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

Date Night models a movie directory that suggests related titles using a 
Binary Search Tree as the data structure.

* No need to assert_equal and refute_equal
* Use nil to represent emptiness, or an empty placeholder, instead of values like 0, or a new Node with no values
* Use assertions to make sure your tree structure is correct, not just that the depth is returned
* Good example of edge case testing, depth_of node that doesn't exist
* Try to name your variables more specifically, i.e. don't call a block variable 'each'

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MacInnes/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Battleship simulates a game of Battleship through a REPL.

* great number of commits; make sure messages are written in the imperative. Would like to see feature branches.
* consistently clean and readable code!
* great naming

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are my group projects:

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letsdothis64/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

Complete Me forms a trie structure that helps to find valid words given a substring.

* Any time you're saying if ..., then return a boolean, there's an opportunity for a refactor
* Should use underscore for naming test files, not hyphen
* Should have spacing inbetween an assignment
* Node testing is not complete. It should be testing the other attributes like weight and child_nodes
* It would be nice if test_populate was separated in to two tests, one with the whole dictionary and one without
* Instead of first_hash second_hash in test_weight, I would've just had one variable called expected
* Tests could benefit from a setup method
* In test_select, I would have made sure that the usage weighting doesn't apply to substrings that haven't been selected

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/1powechri2/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Black Thursday creates an in memory relational database with data analytics.

### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

My main take away from this Gear Up is that it's important to take care of my mental and physical health while
struggling through Turing.  Realizing my limitations and honoring them is important, when I stretch myself too thin
not only am I stressed but my productivity goes down as well.  Taking regular breaks, sleeping well, and getting
exercise is actually the best way to learn.

#### Health & Wellness
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

My take away from this Gear Up is that the tech world is not as diverse as other industries.  The stereotype of
a straight white (nerdy) male programmer is an unconscious expectation a lot of people have of the tech industry.
This creates the perception of an unwelcoming community to anyone who doesn't "fit" that stereotype.  It's 
important to make everyone feel welcome, and to be part of the solution.

#### Success Through Failure

This was my favorite Gear Up, by far.  I did a lightning talk on the same subject, so I was interested to see 
how Mod 4 students handled the subject.  My main example of a "failure" is having graduated Galvanize, squandering
my abilities, and having to go back to Turing (I don't see that as a failure now).  Surprisingly, one of the Mod 4
students leading the talk had _literally_ the exact same story as I did.  Graduated Galvanize, found an unchallenging
and underwhelming job, lost his girlfriend, lost the job, didn't know what to do, decided on Turing.  He's
graduating Mod 4 and signed a job offer the day before that Gear Up.  Gave me a lot of hope.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel that I helped explain some confusing concepts to some students who were struggling
in a way that helped them understand.  I also helped to support my paired project partners
in following a TDD process and to develop an open and comfortable line of communication.  
While this may not be applicable to this question, I've also made an effort to be involved
with the community as a whole by showing Complete Me at the Code Fair, going to the Boulder
Ruby meetup where Jeff spoke and introducing myself to the group as well some Turing alums, 
and bringing a Senior Staff Engineer who's a good friend of mine to help mentor other students.
