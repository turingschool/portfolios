#### Rush Hour Feedback

##### Team Member 1
"Working with Matt was a very pleasant experience. He was extremely committed to the project and willing to contribute at all times. When we paired, I liked that he would always listen to my ideas and suggestions, but also would make sure to communicate his own thoughts and ideas, and in multiple occasions our discussions led to solutions for the project. Matt is very calm, and this is something that can be very beneficial to any group he works with in the future."
##### Team Member 2
"I was incredibly impressed with your seamless transition into a group where you didn't have the same history that the rest of us did with each other! You were 100% committed to the team and the project and that contributed majorly to us being a successful group. I thought it was great how you asked questions, or expressed agreement/disagreement as we were discussing different approaches and ideas - this kept us innovative. You showed a great understanding of the concepts needed to complete the project which made you a valuable resource to our team. My suggestion was to try for the most appropriate data access/method approach(i.e. ActiveRecord methods vs Ruby), but I saw this improve by the end of the project. Still a good question to continually be asking "Is there a better/easier/simpler way to get this result?"
##### Team Member 3
"You did a good job being a committed partner to everyone. You stayed late, stepped up and made great suggestions, and always kept an even keel in stressful situations, but you could keep it up in order to be the best kept secret in 1605."

#### Little Shop
(In collaboration with Lin McCartney and David Tinianow)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matthewrpacker/exotic_pet_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

#### Little Shop Assessment Notes


#### Little Shop Feedback

##### From Lin McCartney
"Matt was a pleasure to work with on the Little Shop project.  Right off the bat, he was valuable for our group dynamic when he showed the team shortcuts he learned so we could navigate through the project efficiently, such as Search functions and for test building strategies.  Matt has an extremely focused mind-set and analytical mind-set and would calmly power through a problem with a lot of planning and then careful execution.

Matt also pushed the group to use Test-Driven Development at every step of the way, and helped us focus on the task at hand.  I found this to be extremely helpful in my own learning and for the team’s learning, which was the ultimate goal of the project. I am very pleased with the project we built together."

##### From David Tinianow
"You showed tremendous dedication to our project and were easy to work with.  You have a sharp eye for detail and had a very cautious approach. These are both good qualities, although constructively, I think you could benefit from being a bit less tentative and learning to be a bit more comfortable with experimentation.  With that said, you made sure our group strictly followed TDD and this benefitted us greatly.  I also liked that you made it clear you that prefer to pair program, and followed this up by being a proactive, friendly, and easy-going pairing partner. It was a pleasure working with you."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

##### To Robert Doyle:
"Roberta's enthusiasm is contagious.  This improved the team dynamic on many levels and allowed each member of the team to feel included.  Also, I really enjoyed Roberta's pairing style.  We usually used a ping pong approach, and when I drove, she would allow me to test my assumptions.  Oftentimes, she knew that a process would not work, but she still allowed me to try it out so that I could see the issue for myself.  I found this approach very helpful.  It made me feel as though we were truly working as a team, and all ideas were welcome.  Also, I never had a doubt in Roberta's commitment to both the team and the project.  Roberta is tremendously driven, and this made me want to push myself to do better each day.  I'm thankful to have worked with her on this project." - Matt Packer

##### To Jason Hanna:
“Jason's calm demeanor during our pairing sessions allowed me to openly communicate ideas and strategies.  Also, Jason was great at communicating while driving.  This helped me follow his thought process and allowed me to better contribute to the problem.  I found that when I drove, Jason was always actively participating with the issue at hand.  Basically, he is a pro at pairing.  Jason was an amazing contributor on this project and I'm glad I had the chance to work with him.
" - Matt Packer

##### To Angela Lindow:
“Each day, Angela's work ethic exceeded my expectations.  She is exceedingly focused, and excels at taking initiative on project components.  I found working with Angela was both comfortable and rewarding.  When I didn't understand a process, Angela was very good at explaining her reasoning and goals.  I found that this helped me better contribute to each iteration of the project.  Angela has a true talent at communicating complex processes to the team in a way that is easy to understand.  I truly enjoyed working with her, and I think she would be a terrific mentor for students." - Matt Packer

##### To Lin McCartney:
"Lin was amazing to work with.  She is highly observant and gifted at expressing her viewpoints in a way that the whole team can comprehend.  Also, she was very good at keeping the team focused.  I found this tremendously helpful for the group dynamic and progress.  For example, if the team was spending too much time on a specific feature, she would communicate that we should pivot to our top priority.  Lastly, I really appreciated her drive, focus, and encouragement.  I thought she was very supportive, which made me feel comfortable asking questions when I didn’t understand a concept." - Matt Packer

##### To David Tinianow:
"David is an amazing teacher.  He consistently checks for understanding and explains things in a way that is easy to absorb and implement.  For example, when we started the project, I was still a bit confused on specific features of Git.  He took the time to listen to my points of confusion and he addressed each point in a way that was very logical.  This helped me better contribute on the current project, and provided me with confidence moving forward.  Also, he is a pairing pro.  He knows when to navigate, but also allowed me to test my assumptions.  This gave me confidence that he would express concern when warranted and ultimately made me relax when driving.  Lastly, it is clear that David retains deep understanding of anything he learns.  I noticed that he was really good at figuring out why something worked.  I found this helped me better understand new concepts, because he would take the time to fully understand something, retain it, and explain it to the group in a way that was easy to follow." - Matt Packer

### Playing a Part
I did my best to support the Turing community by:
* Working with the Hopper Posse offering help, guidance, and encouragement to fellow students.
* Actively participating in each class.
* Teaching others every new shortcut or interesting trick I learned.
* Offering fellow cohort members assistance in the homework channel when I felt that I was in a position to help.
* Posted two technical blog posts.
