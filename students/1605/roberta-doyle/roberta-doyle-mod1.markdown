### Work

I worked on the following projects during Mod 1:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

This was my first project at Turing. It was assigned to Echo students on the second day of the module and we had ~ 1 week to complete it.

Mike's Notes:

* two large classes
* Program fully functional, although there was some confusion as to how the cheat functionality worked.
* There are the beginnings of organization, remember to pull out code that belongs together to their own separate classes.
* Saw that classes took arguments and return values a lot - great keep it up
* Think about how you would pull out any text printed out to the screen into its own class or a module for organizational purposes.

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style                
* 3 - Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### Enumerable & Collections                
* 3 - Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

##### REPL Interface and Game Functionality   
* 3 - Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

##### Breaking Logic into Components          
* 3- Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This was my second project. It was a 3-day project and based on the linked list concept.

Mike's Notes:

* 24 tests
* Make sure tests are small and don't involve other methods
* Generally good code, very well split up.
* Some methods are longer, and could use better names.

##### Functional Expectations                         
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

##### Test-Driven Development                         
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style                        
* 4: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Looping or Recursion                            
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/battleship)

3-day project. I did not do great on this project, but I learned a lot! Tests started to make a lot sense and I finally could see how they can drive the design of your code.

Horace's Notes:

* Lot of progress and seems like some good learning came out of all of it
* Game gets through most of the gameplay but has some trouble finishing out the sequence when the player wins
* A few categories of improvements we might make stand out:
* Looked at taking sequences of methods that get used in a linear process and isolating them from one another so that i could use JUST step 1 if i wanted to in isolation
* Talked about focusing on return values of methods and how this improves testability of the project
* Also keep looking out for opportunities to take a handful of individual but similar values / variables / etc and put them into 1 collection (rather than storing row_a, row_b, etc)
* Obviously using enumerable methods effectively will be the key to this
* Several of the objects are still a bit large, especially from the perspective of how many instance variables we are storing -- when we start to see this, need to ask if we can make multiple different objects out of the big one

##### Functional Ruby & Style          
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Enumerable & Collections         
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

##### Test-Driven Development          
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

##### REPL Interface                   
* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

##### Breaking Logic into Components   
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


## Team

### Projects


#### HTTP, Yeah You Know Me!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/httpyykm)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This was a one-week pair project in which we created a simple server.

Mike's Notes:

* butthole is not a known word. (note: Roberta did not check to see if butthole was a word)
* 41 assertions
* Well written tests, some edge cases could use more attention.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity, specifically, conditionals and branches in conditionals
* Overall, very well organized.
* Good use of modules, some could be added to, but not too much


##### Overall Functionality           
* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style        
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### Test-Driven Development         
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

##### Breaking Logic into Components  
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This was the final 2-week project of the module.
I learned a lot from the pairing experience. It was a very challenging and stressful project, but I truly enjoyed working on it.
I don't think I would have been able to put in so many hours if I didn't love programming that much.  

Project Learning Goals
* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
* Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
* Connect related objects together through references
* Learn an agile approach to building software

##### Functional Expectations          
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6

##### Test-Driven Development        
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style       
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

##### Code Sanitation
* 1: More than ten complaints

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Ryan Flach
Working with Ryan was a fantastic experience. He's very organized and communicates well. Ryan has a strong knowledge and understanding of ruby, which was extremely valuable for our project. At the same time, he's collaborative and gave enough space for both of us to contribute and play an important role in this project.
Ryan is flexible and open to ideas, we were able to discuss different approaches on how to solve the problems/challenges we encounter throughout the project.
I hope I had another chance to work together with Ryan. I definitely learned a lot from him and appreciate his work style.

Feedback to Sonia Gupta
Sonia did a fantastic job on the Headcount project. Her contributions allowed us to complete the project and were essential to the breakthroughs that we had. Sonia is too hard on herself, and often tend to lower the importance of her work.
I appreciate Sonia's honest communication, although  sometimes it comes off a little aggressive and/or impulsive. Throughout the project, she showed a great effort on adequately communicating her thoughts and concerns, and our pairing experience certainly improved.
I would encourage her to believe and trust on herself. Often times when she communicates she qualifies her ideas and opinions in a negative way (i.e. 'I have an idea, but I'm sure it's terrible').
I enjoyed working with Sonia, and I believe that we both learned a great deal out of this pair experience! We also had a fun work weekend together, and I was glad to get to know her a little bit better.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Tommasina
Roberta cheered me up during a low moment by appreciating something about myself that I hadn't noticed. Her perceptiveness and peaceful demeanor make her a programmer to be admired and a friend to be cherished. I'm so impressed by her progress this module in excelling in Echo projects alongside our normal classwork--I know she will do great things with her strong coding skills.

Feedback from Sonia Gupta
Roberta was a pleasure to work with. Her skill level is extraordinary and she was the engine behind this project. She was patient when I struggled and I appreciated that. Although we had some communication issues at the beginning, she was amenable to discussing them, and I believe we were able to make progress after that. I learned a lot about pairing with her, and I am grateful for the experience.

Feedback from Ryan Flach
Roberta was the perfect teammate. She possesses technical strength to solve most problems, but, more importantly, she is persistent and positive when we encounter a problem that we aren’t immediately able to solve. She doesn’t allow herself to become too entangled on a single issue and acknowledges when it is time to move onto a different approach. She is able to talk through and explain her reasoning, and she shares in all responsibilities to achieve a good working balance and eliminate any ill feelings from one partner doing too much or too little. She would be a strong asset on any team.

### Playing a Part

* Attended all guest speaker talks, participated in electives, and gear-ups.
* I LOVE my posse and I'm excited on getting started on a side project. During this module, I built a simple Google Chrome Extension to venture myself into new challenges.
