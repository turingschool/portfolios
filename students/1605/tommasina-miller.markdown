# Tommasina Miller - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
 This module, I want to immerse myself in learning as much as I can about Ruby and OOP. Though I've had limited experience working with Ruby prior to starting at Turing, I am confident that I can learn the fundamentals and

Notes:

      Looking solid with Ruby fundamentals and basic OOP mechanics
      Seem comfortable defining classes, methods, working with ivars, interacting between multiple classes
      testing is looking good -- seem to have main concepts down and be executing on them -- keep an eye on edge cases and making sure we test each scenario with a few different inputs
      Round class was quite concise and well-implemented; talked about a few ways to possibly make it even simpler by avoiding tracking duplicative information in multiple instance variables
      Doing this will make the code a little leaner and also give us better paths to testing some of this logic
  
  Scores:
  1. Functional Expectations
  
      3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.
  
  2. Test-Driven Development
  
      3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
  
  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  
      3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
  
  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  
      3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
  
  5. Enumerable & Collections
  
      3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
