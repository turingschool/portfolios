### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Mastermind is a 3 day project where you are to build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface.

Notes: low-level fundamentals and mechanics seem solid -- should put you on a good footing for doing more complex projects during the module

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Sorting_Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Sorting_Suite is a 3 day project. In this project, you are challenged to implement three fundamental sorting algorithms.

Notes:
Rakefile, 19 tests all passing
Very terse methods,

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In jungle_beats we build a linked list with methods that helped manipulate the data contained within the list.

Notes: 17 tests, all passing

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

In Battleship You are to build a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.

Notes:
somewhat miraculously made a working game out of some pretty gnarly code
Good: Logic, patience, diligence, attention to detail

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* REPL Interface: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## Team

### Projects

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/twhitinger/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project we'll begin to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

25 tests
Make sure to cover multiple cases in tests, so that a hardcoded response from any method will not continue to make tests pass.
refactor for clarity and to separate out responsibilities.

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This was a two week project that helped develop our skills working with another person. I paired with Zack Forbing. We were evaluated by Horace with the following results:

Notes: all expected functionality works.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Feedback to Me

>**From Zack Forbing:** Trent helped me throughout this project understanding things that didn't make sense, and getting me started when I wasn't sure where to begin. his work ethic and focus are admirable, and his comfort with venturing into the unknown is impressive. His ability to test and then quickly build out complex functions was incredibly valuable for Headcount. Overall, Trent has definitely shown that he has what it takes to be an incredible programmer.

>**From Tommasina:** During one emotional moment the night before a project due date, Trent gave me a pep talk that helped me get through my block. He also spent hours of a Friday afternoon re-working a project with me so that I could keep up. His self-deprecating jokes often belie his true studiousness and natural coding skills--in any case, I'm grateful for his help and his sense of humor that have brightened many work hours for me!

>**from Lane Winham:** Trent was a great partner to work with during our pairing on HTTP. I think we hit the ground running in terms of team cohesion, we rapidly  found our strengths and worked with them. He was always willing to try out new ideas or approaches to the issues at hand.  I believe Trent will do well in this environment!

### Giving Feedback


>**To Lane Winham:** Lane has a strong eye for managing git workflow, developing a plan of action to tackle and break down large problems into manageable chunks. He keeps a positive attitude in the face of difficult and overwhelming difficulty. He is also just a great guy to work with!

>**Zack Forbing** Zack has a great focus on using test driven development to guide decision making. He has a strong work ethic, always willing to stay late and finish up a particular problem when necessary throughout the two week final project. He displayed true grit completing headcount and refactoring it up to spec, great job Zack!

>**Mark Miranda** Mark was my pre-work mentor, as well as in my micro-posse for the first three weeks of Turing, He was incredibly supportive and always willing to look at code as well as help other mod1 students. He was available every day early before school to bounce ideas off of and  help me elucidate my thoughts. Thanks a lot Mark!
