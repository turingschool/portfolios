For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

## Community

### Giving Feedback


>**To Kris Sparks:** Willing to put in the time and make sacrifices to complete the project. Made good use of asking questions or asking others for new ways of approaching a tricky problem instead of getting discouraged.  Willing to come in through out the weekend as needed to complete the project. Keep asking questions and leading by example so other team members are motivated to work hard like you.

>**To Nicole Marino:** Good use of waffle, organizing the project, and breaking it out to the members of the group. kept a positive attitude even when progress was slow. Did a good job at coming up with solutions to difficult problems in the project, but don't be afraid to ask questions if implementing a solution is taking longer than you expected.

>**To Jason Hanna:** Caleb, you are dedicated to completing the task in front of you regardless of the time needed to reach the promised land.  You do a great job at looking at problems from multiple angles until you find a solution that works. Great job at using tests to drive out the development of our user stories and using CSS and styling many of the views in our website. Stay positive the sky the limit

>**To Caleb Cowen:** Great job committing yourself to the project. You were willing to work late when needed, come in on weekends as well as dive into the problems and user stories and talk them out with me so I understood what was going on as well. Very effective at researching the extensions and email call backs to implement in our projects. 10/10  Would work with again.


### Feedback to Me

>**From Kris Sparks:** You were a valuable asset to our team. You contributed significantly to the project and did a great job of troubleshooting and problem-solving. You were always willing to do whatever needed to be done and kept the project moving forward. You have a lot to offer a team and should work on communicating better and more consistently. You were appropriate and much needed levity to the project. Nice work.

>**From  Nicole Marino:** Trent, you're a logic guru, and you solve like 50% of the problems we have. Just don't disappear for 5 hours and not tell us whats going on hahaha. And relax a little, you get too worked up during project time. Honestly, this survey is useless because I already told you how I felt in person. Like an adult.

>**From  Jason Hanna:** Trent was great to work with during Little Shop. He is clearly one of the strongest members of our cohort. He always strived to understand what was happening behind the scenes and took the learning process very seriously. I could always depend on Trent to work hard. We would divide and delegate tasks to each other, and the next day I was always amazed at the quantity and quality of his work. I would definitely work with him again

>**From  Caleb Cowen:**  Trentâ€™s knowledge of jquery and willingness to research out new and better ways to implement features was a great addition to our team. I learned a lot as a result of his constant research.
