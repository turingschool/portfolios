### **_Areas of Emphasis_**

> For Module 2, I set out to understand what exactly Ruby on Rails is and understanding the backend for web applications. Also, I would like to understand how to interact with a database with relationships.

**Evaluation comments:**

N/A

**Evaluation scores:**

##### 1. Functional Expectations


* **3:** Application fulfills base expectations

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* **3:** Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* **4:** Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility


##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* **3:** almost **4**! Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* **3:** Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.


##### 6. View Layer

* **4:** Application breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

**_Pair Feedback _**

Chris
> I appreciate your work ethic - I think you’re willing to contribute more time to a group project than most people at Turing. The only constructive feedback I have is that it seems like you get distracted easily and stray from the task that we had been working on as a group. However, your contributions were all very much appreciated and I think you were the best “driver” of the group when we were doing paired programming. You did a great job with the portions of our project which you undertook on your own. Thanks!

Matt

> you did a good job on the front end and teaching me about partials and bootstrap.  You were awesome at taking the time to explain your thinking when pairing to work through a problem.  You have a good grasp on how the logic of our code worked.  You could improve a bit on doing the smallest steps first, but overall it was awesome to pair with you.

**Evaluation comments:**

N/A

**Evaluation scores:**

##### 1. Feature Completeness

##### 4. Models

* **3:**  Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features


##### 5. Testing

* **3:** Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

##### 6. Usability

* **4:** Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

##### 7. Workflow

> "It was a good experience working with you. You were willing to contribute in any way and participated in all phases of the project. You jumped into to new and difficult challenges and did a great job problem solving. You can continue to work on Git workflow and communication and making sure everyone in the group knows what you are working on and which tools you are using. You are patient and enthusiastic. I really appreciate your encouragement and support. Your contributions to the project were valuable and significant. “ -Kris Sparks

### Giving Feedback

> I really enjoyed being a part of the Turing community. Things can be left here knowing that it will still be there upon coming back. The support is also amazing considering that we have to keep switching teachers every 6 weeks which is incredible to establish that much trust for teachers in such short periods of time. The part that I enjoyed the most was helping other students understand difficult concepts and trying to help them whenever I have time. Also, even though this is a difficult environment, I felt like very few people were having as much fun as I was. Also, when talking to Beth, I felt like she had a really good idea about making paths that students can take in Turing to choose what direction they want to go once they graduate. The one thing I really didn't enjoy though was the atmosphere some people brought in by being negative, not taking responsibility, or being condescending but I realize that it's an individual's thing.

### Being a Community Member

> - Yoseph was the first person that I met outside of my cohort at Turing. On day one of the module he saw another mod 1 student and I working on some exercises and immediately walked over, introduced himself, and asked if we needed help. It struck a chord with me how naturally he did this, and gave me a preview of what the Turing community is all about. He continued to offer his help throughout the module, both in official pairing sessions and general work on projects and exercises in the Big Workspace. He even gave me a pep talk before my final assessment when I told him how nervous I was. Yoseph is a fantastic programmer and teacher: he challenges you to truly think about what you are trying to solve, and attempts to lead you to the proper course of action to solve that problem. -- Brian Heim M1


> - Yoseph has played a huge support system for me this module. During the ascension of some major slopes during big projects this module, yoseph has been more than generous with his time to coach me and team members through complex algorithms and general project direction. He is patient, focused, and a natural teacher eager to learn as much as possible. Yoseph is a natural leader and speaks intelligently about his direction. Being aware of 'preserved learning', he drove much of our pairing sessions with an intent to allow 'aha' moments to come naturally while highlighting greater-picture thinking that is vital to a the development process. I am positive he will be of great value to his teams in the future. -- Kinan Whyte M1
