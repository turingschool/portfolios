# Kris Sparks - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to complete every project and to receive at least a score of 3 in every category on every project. I scheduled mentoring sessions almost every morning and afternoon in order to ensure I had support on a daily basis. I focused on exercising the fundamentals of Ruby. I committed to develop my programming skills and problem solving abilities using test driven development. I worked to approach each task at the smallest, most fundamental level and to build algorithms incrementally to complete the larger tasks and projects.

### Work

#### FLASHCARDS

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, you'll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

Assessed By: Brenna

Notes:

* 26 Assertions
* Really good use of refactoring and separating out the start method
* Could use some additional refactoring with if-else stuff
* Need more sad path tests

Scores:

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
* Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### NIGHTWRITER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Assessed By: Rachel

Notes:
* some repetition of code within methods

Scores:

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 3.5 (4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.)
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Team

### Projects

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project we'll begin to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

Paired with: Garrett Smestad

Assessed By: Rachel

Notes:
* avoid repeating the same code
* appropriately name methods, use verbs for methods that do
* use the best, most appropriate enumerables

Scores:

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities.

"Kris was a great partner during the project. Despite a disparity in our understanding of the concepts involved (Kris was very knowledgable, whereas I was still struggling to wrap my head around things), Kris was willing to adapt to my speed, and was patient enough to let me try out my ideas even if he knew they wouldn’t work, so that I could get a better understanding. He worked hard throughout and contributed heavily, ensuring that we completed the project successfully and on time.” - Garrett Smestad

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Federal and state governments publish a huge amount of data. You can find a large collection of it on Data.gov -- everything from land surveys to pollution to census data.

As programmers, we can use those data sets to ask and answer questions. We'll build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation.

Starting with the CSV data we will:

* build a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data
* build a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
* build an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I continue to believe that the single greatest resource and asset at Turing is the student community. The willingness of other students to offer advice and spend their own time helping mentor and teach other students is remarkable.

### Being a Community Member

"Seeing Kris grow this module has been awesome. His knowledge and conceptual understanding has improved so much and it seems to (finally) genuinely excite him. I have also enjoyed having Kris join the Impostors group on a regular basis. His contributions are always appreciated and next module he will be able to help others who aren’t feeling as strong." -Ilana Corson

### Playing a Part

I've been an active participant in the Hopper Posse for 2 modules. I have contributed by helping other's in the posse with their projects. I have also been the recipient of a lot of help within the posse. Additionally, I have been an active participant in most of the community activities.

Every morning I make coffee and/or clean-up the kitchen area and big workspace beyond our assigned responsibilities. I actively seek opportunities to connect with other students, both soliciting and offering help. I spent countless hours before and after school helping Mod 1 students with exercises and projects.
