# Kris Sparks - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal is to learn the fundamentals of Sinatra and Rails. I want to be competent in CRUD and able to build a web application using the Rails framework. I aim to improve my Git workflow, group workflow, and use of the command line and console. I want to build on the fundamentals of problem-solving and Ruby I learned in Module One.

Additionally, I plan to anchor a posse and lead a study group for Module 1 students.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

#### RAILS MINI - IDEA BOX

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Summary: In this project I created a basic rails application to record ideas. Users can create, update, and destroy their own ideas. The app was pushed to and hosted on Heroku. This project was immensely helpful for me because I was able to dig into many of the new concepts we were learning. Having to write code and problem solve independently is how I learn best. I would have liked to get a little further than I did, but I learned a lot about CRUD, routing and rails.

#### MIX MASTER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master/1_getting_started.markdown)

Summary: For this tutorial I created an app to keep track of songs, artists, and playlists. It was an introduction to rails as well as a number of new gems. It was my first interaction with Heroku and an API. This is an excellent tutorial. It was a great rails exercise and I began to see how the various concepts we were learning came together, from HTTP to Sinatra to Rails.

#### ROBOT WORLD

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/crud_sinatra.markdown#spicy-robot-world)

Summary: I built a basic app for a directory of robots. Each robot had a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. This was a relatively enjoyable exercise. It was an accessible task that helped to solidify to process of CRUDing an app. At this point we were hand-rolling a lot of functionality that is built into Rails and it was a great thing to have to learn first, so that I have a better understanding of how everything fits together and works under the hood.

#### TOOL CHEST

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/tool_chest)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/forms_and_route_helpers_in_rails.markdown)

Summary: Tool Chest was an ongoing exercise where we would implement the concepts we were taught in class. It was relatively tedious but I think it was an important part of drilling in on new ideas and methods.

## Team

### Projects

#### RUSH HOUR

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

RushHour is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. I learned a lot about collaborating with partners with wildly different work-styles and workflows, and the importance of patience and communication. I was very disappointed with our final product and the overall effort of our group. It was my first really negative experience with paring. Regarding the project, I did not learn as much as I would have liked, but it was a good exercise in learning to work with databases.

Paired with: Trent Whitinger, Nicole Marino

Assessed By: Andrew & Casey

Notes:
* use proper Ruby syntax and methods
* use ActiveRecord where applicable
* use Git workflow best practices
* name Git commits appropriately and be explicit

Scores:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2.5: Application has some small missing base functionality

Small error preventing complete functionality.

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

Has one feature test and it lacks robustness

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3.5: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
* 3.5: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3.5: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written vi ew helpers.
* 3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.

Feedback:

"Kris, you did a great job with rallying us together. You got us into the building and working the entire time. You were always willing to drive, but firm when you wanted to do something. You never got overly angry at either Trent or I, kept a cool head, and worked harder than any of us. I think you can work on being more positive through the project, and less tense.

Willing to put in the time and make sacrifices to complete the project. Made good use of asking questions or asking others for new ways of approaching a tricky problem instead of getting discouraged.  Willing to come in through out the weekend as needed to complete the project. Keep asking questions and leading by example so other team members are motivated to work hard like you." -Nicole Marino

#### LITTLE SHOP - GAME OF GNOMES

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pwentz/game_of_gnomes)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

We built a small, online ordering platform. Customers are able to place orders and view order details. We were able to divide up a lot of the responsibilities while still involving each member in each phase of the project. We collaborated well together and focused on our project management, using a project management tool, and our Git workflow. I am generally happy with our collaboration and final results.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Calaway: "It’s been a pleasure getting to know and working with Calaway. He has a great presence. It’s enjoyable to talk with him on personal level, as well as school-related topics. He asks astute questions and really listens when we are discussing strategies and solutions. He processes complex problems and continually improves his problem-solving abilities and code. His grasp of the core concepts is evident. He will do well here are Turing and we will be better for having him here. I look forward to working with him in the future.”

To Ben Pepper: "I’ve seen Ben work through module 1 for the second time. He arrives early, works hard and gets assistance when he needs it. He asks great questions, listens intently and implements what he has learned. He has come along way and his improved understanding is evident. Above and  beyond that Ben is always checking in on other students. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone is doing okay and he is willing to listen when things are difficult. He is selfless with his time and that in invaluable. Ben is an asset to the community and I am happy to have the privilege of knowing him."

To Jenny Soden:  “Jenny is always encouraging and willing to help. She has been an enthusiastic and helpful mentor for two consecutive mods. She listens thoughtfully and offers great feedback. Jenny is a great communicator and asset to the community at large.”

To Robbie Jaeger: “For two consecutive modules Robbie has made himself available as a mentor. He is always willing to take time to answer questions and give feedback. He is patient and gives excellent explanations. He is a valuable asset to the Turing community. Sincerely.”

To Charlie Kaminer: “Charlie is always willing to answer questions and give feedback. He does an excellent job of explaining complex concepts. He is always encouraging and his support is valuable, timely and appreciated.”

### Being a Community Member

 "I have worked with Kris in the mornings many times throughout Module 1. He always, ALWAYS lends an ear when I need it and has never once told me that he was unable to take some time to coach me through something. He was monumental in teaching me and my cohort-mates more ways to use Pry and really helped me understood how powerful of a tool it is for developing and learning. Kris is one of the most sincere people I have met and his encouragement and commitment to learning is unmatched. His passion for Turing and the Turing communtity is ever present. Every morning he comes to school and cleans up the kitchen area in the Big Workspace, even though no one asks him to and I am not sure many people know that he does it at all. He is an incredible person and an amazing asset to our community."
 -Susi Irwin

"Kris has been a major support system for me during this module. From my beginning at Turing, he stood out as a person who has seen the spectrum of ups and downs in Turing life thoroughly, yet has come out of his experiences with some big learning. His willingness to help others and make sure their stress levels diminish simultaneously is a quality that will shine through our community here and into any industry. Kris is driven and focused, making him super accessible in pretty much all hours of the day. He made himself available as a mentor for the entire module 1 cohort in the early mornings, evenings, and weekends. He has played a vital role to my success so far and will be an asset to any team in the future." -Kinan Whyte

"I wasn't a member of Hopper posse, but I would still utilize their student support sessions. Kris would check in with me to see if I had any questions about what I was working on, and was always more than willing to help answer any questions that I had. I really appreciated his feedback on what I would be doing with my projects, as well as Kris’ patience in explaining Ruby concepts to me. Thanks, Kris!” -Gabi Procell

"Kris has been an incredible help to our Mod 1 cohort over the past six weeks. His knowledge of the subjects and intelligence shows through immediately when you work with him. He openly admits that he may not pick up all the complex concepts as quickly as the top students at turing, and I think that is part of what makes him a fantastic teacher. He puts in long hours gaining a mastery of the material, then he has a good memory for which portions were the most difficult. I think this struggle gives him a unique ability to assist students through the intense deluge of information and concepts that is life at Turing.

He is very empathetic and has a knack for knowing when other students are struggling. I've seen him seemingly sense when someone has been stuck on a problem, but might not have built up the courage to ask someone, and approach that student preemptively to offer assistance. He is also selfless with his time and I've often seen him check through each classroom before he leaves for the day, already late in the evening, to ask anybody still working if they're doing okay or if they have any questions he can help with. Kris truly an asset to the students of the Turing community." -Calaway

"You can't say enough positive things about Kris.  Since I met Kris he has been more than willing to help out anyone who is having a hard time, take time to listen to people and also to help people understand something better.  Kris was always willing to talk with me when I was considering repeating Mod 1 and gave me a lot of insight into what to expect.  Kris embodies so many qualities that I think Turing tries to teach that I am supremely glad I have been able to get to know him." -Ben Pepper

### Playing a Part

* Leader/facilitator: Hopper posse
* Leader/facilitator: Mod One Study Group
* Leader/facilitator: Impostors Lunch
* Wall of Pictures

Every morning I make coffee and/or clean-up the kitchen area and big workspace (outside of our assigned responsibilities). I actively seek opportunities to connect with other students, both soliciting and offering help. I spend time before and after school helping Module 1 students with exercises and projects.

Hopper posse: As a leader in the Hoppe Posse, I made myself available every morning from 8:30 - 9am for student-directed mentoring and pairing, particularly for Module 1 students. I assisted in problem-solving and basic skills. Because the posse's were not explained well to Module 1 students, and because there was confusion about study groups, and posse's were assigned in an untimely and disorganized manner, Hopper was not as successful as it could have been. I know that Hopper was essential to my success during Module 1 and has been a valuable resource at Turing. It was beneficial for me this module because it helped me to think critically about explaining complex concepts - with which I am familiar - to students for whom those concepts are new.

Student-led session: Patrick Wentz and I led a student-led session on the Pry gem, including the fundamentals of debugging as well as some advanced uses. We received very positive feedback:

“Kris and Pat’s student led session on pry was extremely helpful, and delivered very well. Kris was especially helpful by constantly checking on each person attending individually to make sure they were keeping up and understanding the material. Pat was also very helpful by stopping or being patient by re-explaining parts of the session. I would say that session, in the way they conducted it, should be given for each new module 1 cohort." -Caleb Cowen

"Kris reached and asked me for some feedback on a session he and Pat Wentz led on pry for mod one. As I understand it feedback is supposed to contain something that someone can work on so they can improve. If that’s the case then I don’t really think this will count because Kris has been amazingly helpful throughout the mod. From being an irreplaceable part of Hopper posse, to helping with white-boarding on battle-ship, the pry session and just generally making himself available as resource. He’s friendly, understanding and entirely approachable. I wouldn’t change a thing. Thanks Kris." -Vido Seaver
