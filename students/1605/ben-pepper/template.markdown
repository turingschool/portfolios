### Areas of Emphasis

This being my first module I was more focused on learning some of the basics of programming and breaking problems down into managable portions.

### Work

(Intro)

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/flashcard)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

This assignment was designed to have us run a simple quiz.  The idea was to load a txt file and the present questions to the user via CLI and have the user anser the question.  The program kept count of total quesses, which card was in play, and reutrn the percent correct at the end of the game.  

(evaluation comments)
code is well-written
tests are solid
some confusion with trying to explain certain methods or connection between pieces
all base functionality complete

(evaluation scores)

1. Functional Expectations  3

2. Test-Driven Development  3.5

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  3

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style  3 

5. Enumerable & Collections  3

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)
* 
This project built on flashcards by having us not only read from a txt file but also write to an output file as well.  We had to convert strings of english words to a 2x3 matrix or braille charecters and back again.  This involved not only being able to read the file correctly but also making sure that the output was displayed in the correct format.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### HTTPYYKM

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

HTTPYYKM was our firdt paireed project.  This was designed to have us build a basic web server, take in certain paths from the client and display the corresponding information.  We were to also create a small number guessing game that would be played with using GET and POST so the user could guess the rendomly generated number. 

(evaluation comments)
Testing could have been a bit more robust sicne we only tested a few paths and actoions within the faraday gem.  We also needed to focus more on single responsibility for each object.  Some of our calsses were taking on too much responsibility.
