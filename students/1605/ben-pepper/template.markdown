###Areas of Emphasis

Coming into Turing I was unsure as to what to expect.  My goal was to start understanding the basics of Object Oriented Programming.  

###End of Module Assessment

* Doing really well with overall fundamentals -- syntax, variables, methods, defining classes, testing, etc
* Could be a touch quicker on all of these pieces, but the core is there
* Big themes I still would like to see improved include:
* More comfort with manipulating collection data structures -- we definitely understand how they work / what they represent
* Could be a little quicker working with and manipulating them
* Recognizing the fundamental Command/Query types of methods -- when is a method changing an object vs when is it
accessing data --recognizing this more quickly would help us work with objects more effectively

Scores:

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

##Work

Below are the projects I have worked on during my first 6 weeks at Turing.

###Flashcards

[Flashcard Project](https://github.com/bfpepper/flashcard)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, I wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

code is well-written
tests are solid
some confusion with trying to explain certain methods or connection between pieces
all base functionality complete.

3, 3.5, 3, 3, 3

###Night Writer

[Night Writer](https://github.com/bfpepper/night_writer)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

Night writer has us build a program that was able to take the English Alphabet and convert it to brail. The program takes an input file given to it at the command line and converters it to the output file also taken from the command line.  

Clean code converts from English to Braille talked about refactoring three methods into one by identifying the dynamic value try using enumerables instead of while in order to iterate

Overall Functionality 1.5

Fundamental Ruby & Style 3

Test-Driven Development 2: Conversion class is well tested; would like to see File Accessor class tested in addition to functionality that is not yet implemented.

Breaking Logic into Components 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities (would like to see multiple components pattern continue to be used for building out remaining functionality.


###Chisel

Since I elected to repeat Mod 1 I was given Chisel.  This program is meant to convert a file that is in Markdown notation and convert it to HTML.

###HTTPYYKM

[HTTPYYKM](https://github.com/bfpepper/HTTP)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

HTTPYYKM was our first paired project. This was designed to have us build a basic web server, take in certain paths from the client and display the corresponding information. We were to also create a small number guessing game that would be played with using GET and POST so the user could guess the randomly generated number.

Comments

Testing could have been a bit more robust since we only tested a few paths and actions within the faraday gem. We also needed to focus more on single responsibility for each object. Some of our classes were taking on too much responsibility.

Playing a Part

I didn't feel like there were many ways in which I could give back to Turing during the first mod.  I did however pair as much as possible with 1604 students and participated in Hopper Posse when possible.
