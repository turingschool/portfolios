Areas of Emphasis

Coming into Turing I was unsure as to what to expect.  My goal was to start understanding the basics of Object Oriented Programming.  

End of Module Assessment

* Doing really well with overall fundamentals -- syntax, variables, methods, defining classes, testing, etc
* Could be a touch quicker on all of these pieces, but the core is there
* Big themes I still would like to see improved include:
* More comfort with manipulating collection data structures -- we definitely understand how they work / what they represent
* Could be a little quicker working with and manipulating them
* Recognizing the fundamental Command/Query types of methods -- when is a method changing an object vs when is it
accessing data --recognizing this more quickly would help us work with objects more effectively

Scores:

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

Work

Below are the projects I have worked on during my first 6 weeks at Turing.

Flashcards

[Flashcard Project](https://github.com/bfpepper/flashcard)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, I wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

code is well-written
tests are solid
some confusion with trying to explain certain methods or connection between pieces
all base functionality complete.

Night Writer

[Night Writer](https://github.com/bfpepper/night_writer)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

Night writer has us build a program that was able to take the English Alphabet and convert it to brail. The program takes an input file given to it at the command line and converters it to the output file also taken from the command line.  

Clean code converts from English to Braille talked about refactoring three methods into one by identifying the dynamic value try using enumerables instead of while in order to iterate

Overall Functionality 1.5

Fundamental Ruby & Style 3

Test-Driven Development 2: Conversion class is well tested; would like to see File Accessor class tested in addition to functionality that is not yet implemented.

Breaking Logic into Components 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities (would like to see multiple components pattern continue to be used for building out remaining functionality.


Chisel

Since I elected to repeat Mod 1 I was given Chisel.  This program is meant to convert a file that is in Markdown notation and convert it to HTML.

HTTPYYKM

[HTTPYYKM](https://github.com/bfpepper/HTTP)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

HTTPYYKM was our first paired project. This was designed to have us build a basic web server, take in certain paths from the client and display the corresponding information. We were to also create a small number guessing game that would be played with using GET and POST so the user could guess the randomly generated number.

Comments

Testing could have been a bit more robust since we only tested a few paths and actions within the faraday gem. We also needed to focus more on single responsibility for each object. Some of our classes were taking on too much responsibility.

#### Group Member Names: Garrett Smestad & Ben Pepper
​
## Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
​
#### What are your learning goals for this project?
- How to parse through CSV information.
- How to work with a partner on a long, complex project

#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
- Both of us prefer pair-programming (figuring it out together, as a TEAM!)
- Ben prefers to "drive"

#### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- Text (phone) / Slack to decide on a meeting time, then we talk in person

#### How would you describe your work style?
- Take pomodoro breaks so we don't go insane

#### What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
- Letting each other try out ideas even if the other partner knows it will probably fail, so we don't steal each others' learning

#### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- Collaboration and communication

#### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
- Sundays are "iffy"
- Prefer to stay at Turing no later than 6 or 7pm, but willing to stay if necessary to reach a good stopping point

#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
- Be honest and straight-forward
- Say something now, don't wait for the "right time"

#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
- Ben's good at typing. Like....really good.... Like....mind-blowing.

#### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
- Github
- SimpleCov
- Slack and phones for communication

#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
- Listen to each others' ideas with an open mind
- Ask for help around Turing if anyone's around

#### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
- If it is fully functionl through six total iterations
- Once fully functional, code is clean and refactored

Giving Feedback

Being a Community Member

"Ben is always willing to learn and has made amazing progress throughout the module. He's always time efficient with his assignments and never slacks off. Whenever he struggled, he got into a pairing session and put the extra effort into understanding the problems. He put in more time and effort into mod1 than most students" -Nicole Marino

"Ben, I truly believe you just need a tiny bit more time and more confidence in yourself, and your abilities. The way you “do what you need to do”, so matter-of-factly is astounding. Remember you chose this, staying at Turing, rather than just leaving which does show determination and dedication, because you don’t need to do this. But you want to. You have always been willing to ask for help, which is an astoundingly rare quality. You are able to implement things while simply talking about concepts which proves understanding, and I believe you can do anything you put your mind to. You’re an incredibly kind person, and able to put in the work necessary to succeed. I believe you’re going to do great things, and the extra mod will give you the time to gain the confidence you need to succeed. I know you’ll kick ass next mod. Keep optimistic."  -Jenny Soden

Playing a Part

I didn't feel like there were many ways in which I could give back to Turing during the first mod.  I did however pair as much as possible with 1604 students and participated in Hopper Posse when possible.
