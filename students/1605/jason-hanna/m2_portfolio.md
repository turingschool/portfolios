# Jason Hanna - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I would like to really dive into the fundamentals of front-end design. I have always been interested in designing a website. I would also like to have a firm understanding of rails.


### End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

* A little slow - but fundamentals are there
* Good understanding of all the Rails components
* Would like developer to drill down on rails features and then challenge himself to try to recall how to do things without reference.


## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance

### 4. MVC & Rails Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and keep logic out of views and controllers

### 5. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance

### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback throughout the process

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Rush Hour(Partners: Angela, Matt and Roberta)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)


Receives data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The application parses and stores that data. Site shows client's data about their website traffic through a HTML interface.

## Evaluation Rubric

Assesed by: Andrew

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

#### 6. View Layer


* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view



#### Little Shop (Partners: Caleb and Trent)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/little-shop)
* [Heroku App](https://cyborgism.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

#### Evaluation comments:

##### Assessor: Casey

Notes:
* Email extension and Stripe
* Views need refactoring - logic in the views - understand why this is not okay
* Controllers have some logic - need refactored
* Models look great
* Need some sad path tests
* Good work on workflow
* User experience could be improved by more styling

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## Community

### Giving Feedback
**To Caleb**
Caleb was a fantastic group member on Little Shop. He was always on task and was truly willing to dive deep into a lot of problems that could bring a project to a halt. He spent time when he could have been working on tasks to help everyone else. I could really tell he enjoys coding and problem solving, and that made him fun to work with.

**To Trent**
Trent was great to work with during Little Shop. He is clearly one of the strongest members of our cohort. He always strived to understand what was happening behind the scenes and took the learning process very seriously. I could always depend on Trent to work hard. We would divide and delegate tasks to each other, and the next day I was always amazed at the quantity and quality of his work. I would definitely work with him again

### Being a Community Member

**From Angela**

Jason is easy going, and very flexible. He brought great ideas and solutions for the project. Whenever, he had a different opinion or question he made sure to point that out. A good example was when Jason, along with another team member, realized that we had to change something in our database, which implied in a new migration. I also liked when we were dividing some tasks, that he was straight forward about what he felt he could contribute more and what we would like to work on.


**From Roberta**

Jason - I appreciate how you kept the morale up with jokes and amazing analogies! When switching pairs to work on a different feature, you made sure to ask me to pause and make sure you understood where we are at/what exactly we were trying to implement. This made for a seamless pairing transition. I really felt like you understood all aspects of the project very well and had great approaches to how to complete each iteration which meant that you were well equipped to step in anywhere you were needed. I would have loved to hear you verbalize more of your ideas as we discussed iterations and your thoughts as we were coding.

**From Matt P**

Jason's calm demeanor during our pairing sessions allowed me to openly communicate ideas and strategies.  Also, Jason was great at communicating while driving.  This helped me follow his thought process and allowed me to better contribute to the problem.  I found that when I drove, Jason was always actively participating with the issue at hand.  Basically, he is a pro at pairing.  Jason was an amazing contributor on this project and I'm glad I had the chance to work with him.

**From Caleb (re: Little Shop)**

Jason was a great project manager on little shop. He managed to keep everyone focused on the project and on working well together, as well as knowing when to take a step back and come back later. I very much enjoyed working with him in this group

**From Trent (re: Little Shop)**

Jason, great job committing yourself to the project. You were willing to work late when needed, come in on weekends as well as dive into the problems and user stories and talk them out with me so I understood what was going on as well. Very effective at researching the extensions and email call backs to implement in our projects. 10/10  Would work with again.


### Playing a Part
* I co-led the Hopper posse.  As part of that, I provided help to module 1 students.
* I am an active participant in Productivity Lunch and Imposter Lunch.
* I attended every day this module and sought to be an active and engaged participant in GearUps.
* I gave a Lightning Talk this module.


*Posse*: Hopper Posse's reach was impacted by the decision to allow Module 1 students to join other posse's from day 1. As a result, we had less students regularly attend than normal.
