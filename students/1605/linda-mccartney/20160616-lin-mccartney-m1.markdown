# Lin McCartney - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis include improving my Test-Drive Development (TDD), and improving upon using best-case enumerables.  I'd also like a better understanding of objects and methods, which I feel more comfortable with a second time around. With practice, this will come more naturally to me, so I have placed an emphasis on doing and re-doing exercises provided by the school.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

#### Challenge: What Can I Make

##### Notes:

* Really pleased overall
* See you making correct and intuitive judgements about data structure and objects/methods
* TDD workflow is very comfortable
* Able to recognize and fix mistakes quickly when they happen
* Building good muscle memory around common syntax and features
* Main area for improvement continues to be confidence and speed -- we have all the pieces
and are using them correctly, now you can start to rely on and trust this more and
hopefully by doing this improve the pace a little bit

#### Scores:

##### 3. Ruby Syntax & API

* Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

##### 3. Completion and Progress

* Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

##### 3. Testing

* Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

##### 3. Workflow

* Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### 3. Collaboration

* Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

##### 3. Enumerable & Collections

* Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## Work

* Flashcards
* Night Writer

### Flashcards

* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/flashcards/linda_mccartney.markdown)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)
* [Project Repo](https://github.com/lcmccartney/flashcards)

This is a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

Assessed By: Rachel

#### Notes:

* implemented user input for card deck
* good tests, one missing piece for testing the current card
* talked about using attr_reader methods instead of directly accessing @thing


#### Scores:

##### 3.5 Functional Expectations

* Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

* pplication fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

##### 3.5 Test-Driven Development

* Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

* Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3.5 Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

* Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

##### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### 3. Enumerable & Collections

* Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods (used map appropriately)

### Night Writer

* [Evaluation](ruby-submissions/1605/night-writer/lin-mccartney.markdown)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/67df787e17e66bb446af2e10c4c6e72b3d41579b/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)
* [Project Repo](https://github.com/lcmccartney/night_writer)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Assessed By: Rachel

#### Notes:
* Application converts to Braille and back successfully
* Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### Scores:

##### 2. Overall Functionality

* Application converts to Braille and back successfully

##### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 2.5 Test-Driven Development


##### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


## Team Projects

* HTTPYYKM
* Headcount

### HTTP - Yeah, You Know Me!

* [Project Repo](https://github.com/lcmccartney/http)

This project introduces HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

### Headcount

* [Evaluation](https://google.com)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [Project Repo](https://github.com/ryanflach/headcount)

This project analyzes a large body of data that covers various information about Colorado school districts.
The overarching data themes include analysis of:

* Enrollment - Information about enrollment rates across various grade levels in each district
* Statewide Testing - Information about test results in each district broken down by grade level, race, and ethnicity
* Economic Profile - Information about socioeconomic profiles of students and within districts

Assessed By: Horace

#### Notes

* Completed required iterations and iteration 5 for spec harness woooo
* Overall very clean code that aims for conciseness and is relatively readable
* Doing pretty well at pulling logic into the smaller objects in the system -- however we could still do more of that
* so far doing some formatting and presence-checking on e.g. StatewideTest, Enrollment, EconProfile
* Those are great but these classes can also shoulder some of the weight for actual calculations as well
* tend to end up with headcount analyst doing: 1) data acquisition and aggregation 2) data validation and formatting,

#### Scores:

##### 3. Overall Functionality

* Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as*â€‹ one of Iterations 5 or 6

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 3. Enumerables & Collections

* Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

##### 4. Code Sanitation

* The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows... Zero complaints

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Ryan: "It was a pleasure working with Ryan on the Headcount project. He has a strong communication style that made working with him easy, and is always extremely helpful when anyone in the cohort asks him a question. Ryan could also quickly and effectively build out tests and apply the appropriate methods and enumerables to get the job done. It is very clear that Ryan is natural programmer with an analytical mind-set, and the ability to focus deeply on problems and solve them accordingly.""

### Being a Community Member

From Ryan: "I really enjoyed working with Lin. She has a focused approach to problem solving and is serious about getting work done, opening her schedule to allow for full availability to meet deadlines. Her ability to research issues and determine best-case solutions with enumerables was invaluable, as well as her use of TDD and eye for refactoring. We both have similar work styles and worked very well together. It was fun to be able to communicate openly and honestly, and to try out many different styles of pairing."

### Playing a Part

* Part of my decision to come to Turing was for the community.  I truly enjoy the company of the others students and do what I can to encourage them to do well, provide tips based on previous experiences, and lend an ear when needed.
* One of my goals this module was to be able to help others.  I felt like I played a part where I could when anyone had questions or concerns.
* Recycling, cleaning on schedule
