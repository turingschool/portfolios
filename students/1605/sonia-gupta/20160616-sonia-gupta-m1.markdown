### Areas of Emphasis
My goal in repeating this module was to make the best use of the knowledge I acquired last time so that I could advance to the next module with a solid understanding of OOP and algorithmic thinking. Although I have experienced some struggles, I believe I have achieved my goal. I have significant room for improvement, but I have established productive habits which will facilitate the expansion of my skill set. Most important, however, is that I am starting to develop a passion for programming. For me, passion comes after discipline, and the rigors of this module have instilled in me a dedication to the craft that I did not anticipate. I believe that with further practice, and continued discipline, I will be able to successfully advance through the program.

### Work

I successfully completed all four of the required projects this module. I also spent considerable time on my own working through drills and exercises on my own and in pairs.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

This project involved building a command line flashcards game which accepted guesses from the user and compared those guesses to the correct answers on the cards.

Notes:

clean and straightforward project structure
demonstrating really solid ruby fundamentals and mechanics -- seems like you're much more comfortable now with defining classes, defining methods, working instance variables, and tracing the interactions between a handful of classes
especially like the amount and variety of the tests -- seems like you are giving a lot of attention to thinking about different scenarios, trying out different inputs, etc etc
looked at a couple small style points -- avoiding unnecessarily verbose boolean expressions and not forgetting about methods you already wrote such that you end up reimplementing the same code in another place
finally talked about using small I/O / display helper methods to help break up the structure of a large I/O-intensive loop

## Team

### Projects

I worked on two paired projects this module: HTTP and Headcount. My partners in both projects were exceptional, and I learned an incredible amount from them. I did find some aspects of pairing to be challenging, but I believe that the experiences pushed me to grow as an individual and as a programmer.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/httpyykm)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project involved building an HTTP server which accepted client requests, parsed them, and then sent the appropriate response back to the client.

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/matthewecampbell/httpyykm

Notes:

30 tests
Well separated code
some opportunities to refactor, look at complex conditionals and inside conditional branches
well tested, make sure that you're testing multiple cases in the future

1. Overall Functionality: 3

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

3. Test-Driven Development: 3

4. Breaking Logic into Components: 4

From my partner Matt Campbell: Sonia was a great partner to have for my initial pairing project.  Although I learned many things from Sonia during our time pairing, one of the best things she taught me was how to DTR.  I am a firm believer that both my pairing with Sonia and my pairing with Kris went so well was because of that skill that Sonia imparted upon me.  She was also my light in the darkness throughout HTTP because she was quick to understand the new challenges that were thrown our way and would make sure I understood the goal before we moved forward.  She taught me how to pair by always explaining her thought process before moving forward which is something I strive to achieve by following her example.  She also was a great teacher of advanced ruby syntax and enumerables which I believe was integral for us not only getting through HTTP but also allowing me to affectively tackle my final assessment and Headcount.  In addition to her programming ability, Sonia is just a great addition to the Turing community beyond the obvious :sonia-the-fridge-savior:.  She’s a great leader and ambassador for our cohort and I am glad to be going through Turing with her to learn from.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This project involved parsing CSV data from Colorado school districts to extract information about relationships between the datasets.

1. Functional Expectations: 3

2. Test-Driven Development: 3

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

5. Enumerable & Collections: 3

6. Code Sanitation: 1

From My Partner Roberta Doyle: Sonia did a fantastic job on the Headcount project. Her contributions allowed us to complete the project and were essential to the breakthroughs that we had. Sonia is too hard on herself, and often tend to lower the importance of her work. I appreciate Sonia's honest communication, although  sometimes it comes off a little aggressive and/or impulsive. Throughout the project, she showed a great effort on adequately communicating her thoughts and concerns, and our pairing experience certainly improved.
I would encourage her to believe and trust on herself. Often times when she communicates she qualifies her ideas and opinions in a negative way (i.e. 'I have an idea, but I'm sure it's terrible'). I enjoyed working with Sonia, and I believe that we both learned a great deal out of this pair experience! We also had a fun work weekend together, and I was glad to get to know her a little bit better.

### Giving Feedback

To Kris Sparks: I have had a chance to get to know Kris over the course of the last two modules. His work ethic, drive, and commitment to the task are remarkable. He is frequently among the first to arrive at school, and among the last to leave. I have witnessed him overcome struggles that he previously thought insurmountable, and am inspired by his willingness to expand his comfort zone. He has taught me about patience, kindness, and putting your nose to the grindstone when the task needs to get done. He does not complain, and he often checks in with me, and with others, to see how things are going. He is an asset to the Turing community and I am excited to see what he will accomplish in the future.

To Kerry Sheldon: Kerry has been incredibly supportive this module. She developed the student support system for Pahlka posse, and I have been lucky enough to have her as a mentor in this capacity. Working with Kerry is always such a delight. She has skillfully guided me to my own conclusions rather than foisting answers upon me. Her patience and expertise have allowed me to develop my own skills, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from her. She has taught me a lot about myself as a person and as a programmer. Her commitment to Pahlka posse, and to the greater good, is remarkable. Her leadership will help us to grow and I’m excited to see what she comes up with next module!

To Tommasina Miller: I have watched Tommasina grow so much! She began the module feeling a little unsure of herself, but she did not give up. Instead, she pushed through the doubt and feelings of discouragement and came through to the other side. Her resilience will continue to serve her throughout her time at Turing. Tommasina has also brought an incredible level of positivity and good energy to our cohort. I have been the recipient of her compassion and kindness on more than one occasion. Furthermore, her dedication to civic tech is remarkable, and I’m excited to get the chance to learn from her in Pahlka and in Module 2. Tommasina is a huge asset to the Turing community and her positive outlook will continue to serve her well.

### Being a Community Member

From Kerry Sheldon: I had the opportunity to work with Sonia throughout this module and remain impressed by Sonia’s work ethic and resolve.  I really enjoyed seeing her experience success and acknowledge the progress that she has made over the past few months. I’ve been impressed by Sonia’s discipline to work on drills and exercises in pairing sessions, rather than projects.  She is a disciplined pseudocoder and resourceful problem solver.

Sonia will be the first to acknowledge that her confidence in her programming skills can be tenuous at times. I’d like to see Sonia fake some more confidence in her skills, for her own benefit, and the benefit of her programming.  I think it’s important for Sonia to give herself opportunities for routine, regular wins and to provide herself with a way to objectively see her  progress.

I’m  grateful for Sonia’s commitment to the Pahlka posse throughout the module, in spite of her personal doubts about her ability to contribute.  Her attendance and involvement served as an example to other Module 1 students in the cohort.  Sonia is a natural leader and her presence lends credibility to the rest of us.

From Tommasina Miller: I have watched Tommasina grow so much! She began the module feeling a little unsure of herself, but she did not give up. Instead, she pushed through the doubt and feelings of discouragement and came through to the other side. Her resilience will continue to serve her throughout her time at Turing. Tommasina has also brought an incredible level of positivity and good energy to our cohort. I have been the recipient of her compassion and kindness on more than one occasion. Furthermore, her dedication to civic tech is remarkable, and I’m excited to get the chance to learn from her in Pahlka and in Module 2. Tommasina is a huge asset to the Turing community and her positive outlook will continue to serve her well.

From Kris Sparks: Sonia has shown a strong commitment to the program and the community since day one.  She leads our cohort through the SAB and is always willing to facilitate group discussions and activities. She takes a personal interest in other students and values their success. During this module Sonia has grown monumentally in her abililty to write code and complete projects. She is an asset to Turing and the student body.

### Playing a Part

I tried to help people in my cohort when they asked for technical or other support. I am also a member of Pahlka posse and will be co-leading it next module with Kerry Sheldon. Also, Fridges. :)
