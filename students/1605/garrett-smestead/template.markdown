# Garrett Smestad (M1 Portfolio)

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module is to build a solid foundation so that I can confidently move on to module 2. With no prior experience in programming, I wanted to dive in and see if I actually had the capacity to eventually become a professional programmer.

### End of Module Assessment

__Assessed By: Mike__
###### Scores:
* __Ruby Syntax & API__ -
3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts.

* __Completion and Progress__ -
3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

* __Testing__ -
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design.

* __Workflow__ -
3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts.

* __Collaboration__ -
4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck.

* __Enumerable & Collections__ -
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods.


### Work

The individual projects I completed were: Flashcards and Night Writer. Both were very challenging but manageable, and I learned an important lesson: Day 1 is not break time. Get started immediately, because you'll have a much better chance of sleeping the night before a project is due.<br>
I completed all of the individual projects with overall scores of 3 or above.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/flashcards_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, we wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user is able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.
In order to build good habits, we used TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

###### Notes:
* Great encapsulation.
* Great SRP.
* Could work on testing a little bit more.

###### Scores:
* __Functional Expectations__ -
3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

* __Test-Driven Development__ -
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

* __Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components__ -
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

* __Fundamental Ruby & Style__ -
3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

* __Enumerable & Collections__ -
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/night_writer_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this project we implemented systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and vice versa. We practiced breaking a program into logical components, testing components in isolation and in combination, applying enumerable techniques in a real context, and reading text from and writing text to files.

__Assessed By: Mike__
###### Notes:
* Program works, does not wrap past 80 characters.
* Numbers extensions
* 31 tests, 38 assertions
* tests generally good, make sure you hit edge cases
* watch for consistency in naming
* Pull file writing out to its own class - one file per class

###### Scores:
* __Overall Functionality__ -
2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully (Missing wrapping)

* __Fundamental Ruby & Style__ -
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

* __Test-Driven Development__ -
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

* __Breaking Logic into Components__ -
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

* __Enumerable & Collections__ -
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


## Team

### Projects

The group projects I completed were: HTTP YYKM and Headcount. Both projects were extremely challenging, but the complexity and size of them allowed me to see how a vast number of things work and interact with each other, and helped solidify my understanding of several concepts we had learned over the course of the module.

#### HTTP YYKM

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project we were introduced to HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action. We built a web application that is capable of (1) receiving a request from a user, (2) comprehending the request's intent and source, (3) generating a response, and (4) sending the response to the user.

###### Scores:
* __Overall Functionality__ -
3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

* __Fundamental Ruby & Style__ -
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

* __Test-Driven Development__ -
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

* __Breaking Logic into Components__ -
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Yoyo2Code/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

In this project we worked with a large body of data that covers various information about Colorado school districts. This meant we needed to decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools, which ultimately were used to connect related objects together through references. The project encouraged us to use test to drive both the design and implementation of code, and learn an agile approach to building software.


__Assessed By: Beth Sebian__
###### Notes:
* Spec harness: I0SH: pass, I1SH: pass, I2SH: pass, I3SH: two failures.
* Some long methods juggling a lot of detailed responsibility.
* Missing some unit tests, would like to see more unit testing to drive development.
* Some nice implementations of enumerables.
* Code sanitation: several >80 char lines: blaming it on spec's long method names. Pass.

###### Scores:
* __Functional Expectations__ -
2.5: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes.

* __Test-Driven Development__ -
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

* __Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components__ -
2.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP / Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear.

* __Fundamental Ruby & Style__ -
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

* __Enumerable & Collections__ -
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods.

* __Code Sanitation__ -
4: Zero complaints

#### Getting Feedback
“Garrett worked hard throughout the project. He contributed in meaningful ways and worked to actively problem solve. He put in the hours needed and finished particularly strong by finding  and implementing the solution to get the last iteration working.”<br>- Kris Sparks

## Community

#### Giving Feedback
"Kris was a great partner during the project. Despite a disparity in our understanding of the concepts involved (Kris was very knowledgable, whereas I was still struggling to wrap my head around things), Kris was willing to adapt to my speed, and was patient enough to let me try out my ideas even if he knew they wouldn’t work, so that I could get a better understanding. He worked hard throughout and contributed heavily, ensuring that we completed the project successfully and on time.”<br>- Garrett Smestad

#### Being a Community Member
“Garrett is easy to work with and a good listener. However, he is fairly quiet during pairing sessions and should try to ask for help more often when he gets stuck. ”<br>- Parker Phillips

#### Playing a Part

* I attended micro posse meetings, lightning talks, and retros.
* I also helped clean up every Friday.
