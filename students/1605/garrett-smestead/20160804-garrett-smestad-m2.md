### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module is to build on the foundation I have from module 1. I hope to support my knowledge of _how_ to do certain things by gaining a better of understanding of _why_ we do certain things. I also hope to learn to create more "useable" applications, rather than the simple, bare-bones applications we created in Module 1.

## Individual Work

The individual projects I completed were: Robot World, Tool Chest, Mix Master, and my Rails Mini Project: Film Box.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/crud_sinatra.markdown)

In this project, we learned the basics of CRUD and using Sinatra. I learned a lot about HTTP and request types concepts that were introduced at the end of Module 1 with HTTP YYKM, but were still unclear.

#### Tool Chest

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/tool_chest)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/forms_and_route_helpers_in_rails.markdown)

In this project, we learned about MVC and styling/CSS. I learned a lot about CSS from this project.

#### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

In this project, we learned about Rails, deploying to Heroku, user authentication and authorization, and TDD for Rails apps. The size and complexity of this project taught me more than any other project, and a lot of concepts finally started to click in my head after completing this tutorial.

#### Film Box (Rails Mini Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GSmes/film_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

In this project, we learned more about Rails, but were left without instructions, so we had to figure everything out ourselves. I chose to build an app where users can add movies to a Watchlist, and only Admins can add/delete movies and genres. This taught me how implementing what may seem like a simple feature, could actually turn out to be extremely difficult and complex. I implemented the use of OmniAuth for authorization. It also helped solidify my understanding of partials and forms.

---
## Team Work

The group projects I completed were: Rush Hour and Little Shop. Both projects were extremely challenging, but the complexity and size of them allowed me to see how a vast number of things work and interact with each other, and helped solidify my understanding of several concepts we had learned over the course of the module.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pwentz/rush_hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

In this project we built a web traffic tracking and analysis tool that analyzes HTTP request information for clients. It allows a client to gain information about their users, like how the site is being used and accessed. Allows a client to register their site, accepts client data via POST request to a dedicated endpoint, and provides analytics at site and individual URL level.

__Assessed By: Andrew__
###### Notes:
* Use more ActiveRecord.

###### Scores:
* __Functional Expectations__ -
3: Application fulfills base expectations.

* __Test-Driven Development__ -
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

* __Encapsulation/Breaking Logic Into Components__ -
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

* __Fundamental Ruby & Style__ -
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

* __Sinatra/Web and Business Logic__ -
4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic..

* __View Layer__ -
3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/westeros_outfitters)
* [Heroku URL](http://westerosoutfitters.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

In this project we were given a 'client' and we were expected to drive the project with user stories. Goals of the project including practicing all basic Rails concepts, pushing logic down the stack, and driving development with robust feature testing.

__Assessed By: Casey__
###### Notes:
* All features are implemented with two extensions.
* Refactor flash messages.
* Validate association not foreign_key.
* Controllers look good - small refactorings.
* Models look really good.
* Missing some model test coverage.
* Workflow looks good - need to delete branches after using.

###### Scores:
* __Feature Completeness__ -
4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions.

* __Views__ -
3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through.

* __Controllers__ -
3.5: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack.
3.5: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts.

* __Models__ -
4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features.

* __Testing__ -
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

* __Usability__ -
4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers.

* __Workflow__ -
4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## Community

#### Getting Feedback
“Garrett was an awesome partner to have during Little Shop.  I appreciated that he enjoyed pairing while programming because typically, that is how I would prefer to work as well.  Working with Garrett was easy because he would take the time to explain his thoughts as he worked so I always knew what he was trying.  He often came up with great solutions to difficult problems to keep us moving.  It was very easy to enjoy my time while working with Garrett because of his sense of humor and ability to keep things light.”<br>- *Matthew Campbell (Little Shop project)*

“Garrett, once again you have shown your incredible problem solving skills and dogged determination to find solutions to our problems. You were great on Rush Hour, and Little Shop hasn't been much different in that regard. Your skill in sniffing out small errors that are easily missed is unparalleled. Your willingness to work late into the night (and produce amazing code through it) will serve you well, but don't forget to take pomodoros! fresh eyes are always beneficial, and I'm just as susceptible to that, so together we didn't take many breaks. You seemed to be more willing to do almost anything for Little Shop, whether it was testing, css, troubleshooting, or anything else. just as in Rush Hour, it was a pleasure to work with you again.”<br>- *Zack Forbing (Little Shop project)*

“I am grateful for your ability to find and apply new techniques to help solve whatever problem was at hand. Having your resourcefulness on hand really helped shorten the time spent on hurdles. Oh yeah, nice job with finding and adding that last validation to complete the project!”<br>- *Pat Wentz (Rush Hour project)*

“Garrett was a fountain of knowledge during this project, always researching and googling. Garrett didn't drive much, seeming to prefer having input and discussion about what we should do. He and I could both benefit from being more comfortable in the driver's seat. Garrett's communication was really good about what he was working on when we were separated (avoiding tons of git merges), but missed the mark a bit about being on time. it didn't seem to matter with the three of us, however, as it seemed like we were unstoppable when we worked as a trio. Garrett was also quick to remind us if we were getting pulled off course by some tangential problem. Overall, Garrett was a valuable member of the group and a pleasure to work with.”<br>- *Zack Forbing (Rush Hour project)*

#### Giving Feedback
"Zack Forbing demonstrated a fairly thorough understanding of Ruby and the new material (i.e., databases and relationships). He was crucial in figuring out how to do the project's attribute validations, worked on our CSS and the HTML in views, and did a fair amount of driving. I think he could continue to practice and learn about CSS and HTML in order to improve his skills in those areas, but he certainly knows enough to get the job done.
Overall, Zack was great and very easy to work with, and I would have no problem working with him again.”<br>- *Garrett Smestad (Rush Hour project)*

"Pat Wentz did a great job driving. He is a very fast typer, quick thinker, and can very quickly navigate through the project and the several windows open at once (plus he uses Vim!  :D ), so he did a large portion of the driving. He is very knowledgable and appeared to be very comfortable using Ruby. I especially appreciated his willingness to stop what he was doing in order to explain something more clearly, answer a question, or let Zack/myself take a look at something. I think he could make more of an effort to trust that his group members can help, as there were one or two moments where he spent time alone trying to work through a problem he'd come across.
Overall, Pat was fantastic and very easy to work with, and I would have no problem working with him again.”<br>- *Garrett Smestad (Rush Hour project)*

#### Being a Community Member
“Garrett is easy to work with and a good listener. However, he is fairly quiet during pairing sessions and should try to ask for help more often when he gets stuck. ”<br>- *Parker Phillips*

#### Playing a Part

* I attended weekly guest speakers, lightning talks, and retros.
* I made myself available for 1606-1605 pairing sessions.
* I helped clean up every Thursday.
* I wrote a blog post about how technology has affected the Accounting industry ([Blog Post #1](https://medium.com/@gsmes/how-accounting-has-been-changed-over-time-by-technology-6c85fdfd9a4a#.28253blm2)).
* I wrote a blog post about how best to approach the beginning stages of learning to code ([Blog Post #2](https://medium.com/@gsmes/the-learning-to-code-journey-and-tips-to-get-you-through-it-7a9274284ee9#.fq41x4szc)).
