#Nicole Marino M2 Portfolio

My goals for this module was to obtain a good understnading of rails and activerecord. I wanted to feel more comfortable switching between frameworks. I set out to use more hot keys and improve my workflow. Also to get better at styling and getting back into the swing of front end work.

#Work


##Rush Hour

GitHub URL: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/rush-hour

Notes: Was not seeding properly. Neeeded more feature testing, needed to have unique payload requests.

####Functional Expectations

2.5: Application has some small missing base functionality
Small error preventing complete functionality.

####Test-Driven Development

2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
Has one feature test and it lacks robustness

####Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

####Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

3.5: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
3.5: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

####View Layer

3.5: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written vi ew helpers.
3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

##Little Shop: Westeros Outfitters 

GitHub URL: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/westeros_outfitters

Heroku: https://westerosoutfitters.herokuapp.com/

Assessor: Casey

Notes:
* All features are implemented with two extensions
* Refactor flash messages
* Validate association not foreign_key
* Controllers look good - small refactorings
* Models look really good
* Missing some model test coverage
* Workflow looks good - need to delete branches after using

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

####Feature Completeness

* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

####Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

####Controllers

* 3.5
/* * 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack */
/* * 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts */

####Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

####Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

####Usability

* 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

####Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

##Ungraded Assignments

##Sinatra CRUD: 

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/skill_inventory

This one was super fun. Not only did I get practice exploring CRUD and MVC, but it was my first attempt at styling. Lots of styling was learned.  

##Mix Master: 

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/mix_master

###What I learned:
I learned good practices for MVC, CRUD, and how much I hate tutorials :(

##Tool Chest: 
Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/tool_chest

###What I learned:
We implemented a lot of authorization in this one, which I thought was very helpful practice. Lots and lots of testing! 

##Rails Mini Project
Name: Point Box
Github: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/point_box
Description: I built a program in which you can redeem points given to you by an admin to recieve rewards. It used postgresql, rails, authentication, bcrypt.

###What I learned:
Rails mini-project was at a point where I had been doing rails and activerecord for so long that all the steps were automatic. Operating through the MVC was a breeze. Good practice, and good practice writing some ruby methods which I thought I had forgotten.

##Feedback:

####Feedback from my group mates:

"You contributed consistently and in very meaningful ways. You have a solid foundation in programming, as well as as a good handle on the material we are studying.You were enthusiastic, encouraging, and organized. It might be helpful, in the context of group work, if you used the same workflow and tools as other students, such as hotkeys and Spectacle. You did great work all around."
-Rush Hour Partner 

"Working with Nicole was a good experience. She was quick to jump into the project and get us moving which was beneficial because I believe she had the best grasp on the material in the beginning. I think she could have a bit more organization while attacking problems, like writing tests, but she can often get by without doing so because of her ability to see how things will work in her head. Overall, working with Nicole was a great experience and I learned a lot from her during the course of this project.  We were able to keep it light and fun even when running into hurdles. I hope we get to pair again in the future." -Matt, Little Shop Partner 

"Nicole, you've been indispensable during Little Shop. your project management skills and vigilance for getting stuck in rabbit holes is second to none. I appreciated your plainspoken honesty about the direction of the project, but you also seemed happy to go with the flow at times as well, which was valuable in a group of four people. It would have been nice to see you hang around longer, but I understand that others have more responsibilities than I do currently! I also think it would do you well to take your syntax a little more seriously. Employers will be looking at that kind of stuff, but I feel like I'm nitpicking at that point, because you did a great job!"-Zack, little shop partner


"Good use of waffle, organizing the project, and breaking it out to the members of the group. kept a positive attitude even when progress was slow. Did a good job at coming up with solutions to difficult problems in the project, but don't be afraid to ask questions if implementing a solution is taking longer than you expected."
-Rush Hour Partner 

####Feedback I provided to my group mates:

"Matt, you are awesome at keeping the teams energy up. You bust out commits like someone whose about to go over a deadline. You're an awesome navigator and logic comes easy to you. You have a a good understanding of the things we've learned, but can still come up with your own solutions using logical thinking. One thing to work on is not getting  stuck down rabbit holes. Spending more than an hour on one problem can be draining. Take a break, or ask one of the other team members for help. We're here to help solve problems, because 4 brains are better than one. Other than that, good job. Thanks for being the group d.j. " -Nicole, Little Shop

"Kris, you did a great job with rallying us together. You got us into the building and working the entire time. You were always willing to drive, but firm when you wanted to do something. You never got overly angry at either Trent or I, kept a cool head, and worked harder than any of us. I think you can work on being more positive through the project, and less tense. Projects suck, don't make them suck more by dwelling on them."


Personal Scores:

3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

I think my refacotring skills have improved since rush hour, and my basic understanding of rails functionality went up since my mid mod to my final assesment. Aso, my testing and ruby syintax has gone up between rush hour and little shop.

4: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

My partners provided feedback that I included in this portfolio to prove my ability to work in a partnership. I also was able to maintain being a project manager for both of my group projects. I think this is my strongest subject. 


3:Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above-and-beyond supports of the community.

  *Helped clean the fridges, and took over the fridge cleaning duties when Sonia left. 
  *Did pairing sessions with mod1 students. 
  *Was readily available to help my fellow cohort members.
  *Did my assigned cleaning duties every week. 
  *Participated with meaningful conversations in gear ups. 

3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

I have been implementing more hot keys in my work flow because my previous partners have complained about my workflow. I've also grown leaps and bounds since mod1 when it comes to paired programming. Including giving up the control and letting others drive, and staying late at turing. 


##Final Thoughts:
I think I should pass because I've shown major growth between my final assesment and my mid module assesment. 
I set out to memorize syntax and deepen my knowledge of rails so that the next step would comeinstinctually and I wouldn't struggle as much. I do feel like I accomplished that and I now have a deep understandinf of the topics covered. Also, we rocked the final project. I  do not think I would benefit from repeating. 

Rubric Scores

A: End-of-Module Assessment: X
B: Individual Work & Projects: X
C: Group Work & Projects: X
D: Community Participation: X
E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: X

Notes

* Huge improvement from mid module to final assessment
* Also huge improvement from Rush Hour experience to Little Shop
* Would have liked to TDD and ask for help sooner with Rush Hour - better time management
* Rails Mini project was most helpful individual project
* Now typing with four fingers instead of two, learned some hot keys, continuing to improve
* Continuing to improve working with others
* Could benefit from taking a step back and slowing down to catch potential syntax errors

Outcome

Pass
