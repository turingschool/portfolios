# Nicole Marino - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to get a deep understanding of ruby syntax and concepts. I wanted to feel comfortable working with the algorithmic process. I hoped to change the way my mind worked so I would become more of a problem solver. I wanted to be able to take on projects that I viewed were above my level of understanding and complete them. 

## End of Module Assessment

###Notes:

* Have to work on heads-up typing
* Watch out for indentation of your code
* Messy on the fringes -- whitespace, thinking about variable scope, indentation, typos
* Fine on logical thinking
* Solid on Ruby methods and knowing what's available
* Have concerns about progress being hindered by mechanics

###Scores:
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
​
​
* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.
​
​
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
​
​
* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction
​
​
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
​
​
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


Plans for getting my workflow up to speed: During the time in between modules, I'd like to do typing.io exercises everyday to help me learn to type with more than two fingers and to help keep my eyes off my keyboard. By week 3 of mod2, I'm hoping to be typing without looking at my keyboard at all. I also need to take my time and work on my style in the next modules to come. 


### Projects


---------------

## Mastermind:

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/Mastermind
Original Assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown
Description: Create a working mastermind game. 

No comments

###Scores: 

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

REPL Interface and Game Functionality

4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

---------------

## JungleBeats:

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/JungleBeats
Origin Assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat
Description: Linked Lists 


Notes:

21 tests - raises an error during test as intended.
next time, place tests in a test directory, and code files in a lib directory.
Write more descriptive test names
each class should have its own file where the name of the file matches the class
good iterative implementation in looping methods
Remember that you can get all of your getter methods for free with attr_reader
Lean more on your debugging tools instead of puts driven development.
good way to develop good style - check out http://houndci.com or rubocop

###Scores:

Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations

Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

---------------

## SortingSuite

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/SortingSuite

Description: Sorting Algorithms 

Notes:
Had to fix path to get tests to run.
9 tests, all passing
did in place insertion in lieu of insertion

###Scores:

Functional Expectations

3: All three sort classes work as expected

Testing

4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

Ruby Style

3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

Organization

3: Each sorter class has it's own file in the proper directory and it's own test in the test directory

---------------
## Battleship

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/Battleship

Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown

Description: Battleship gameplay. 



###Scores:

Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

Test-Driven Development

1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

---------------
##HTTP-YYKM

GitHub URL: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/HTTP-YYKM

Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

Description: HTTP requests & Web Server 

Notes:
diagnostic data works
/hello increments counter -- make sure only for this path
datetime and shutdown both work
iter 3 word search works
I4 & I5 working
when initializing an object, don't have any other side effects; use a method for that

###Scores:

Overall Functionality

3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
Echo/Foxtrot Note: Requirements listed are for Foxtrot pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5


Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.


Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.


Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

--------------

## HeadCount

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/headcount

Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/headcount

Description: Parsing big data from csv files.


1. Functional Expectations

1: Application crashes during normal usage
Reassessment score: 1 (Considering the spec harness failed during the assessment and when we reviewed the code later, the reassessment score remains a 1)
2. Test-Driven Development

0: Pending re-eval
Reassessment score: 2 (Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient)
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

3: Five or fewer complaints



Notes from me: 

Beth suggested that I explain why our headcount crashed during spec harness. We have a major git issue in which files were required and loaded in the wrong way, so the data ended up not being accurate on our master branch. 
It is an easy problem to fix and can be done in one day with my partner. Our logic was sound and our tests did pass, we just needed more time to fix the errors we got from merging.

## Team
 DTR Memo:
 
 When I spoke with Pat for  our headcount project, this was the first time I had a conflict with a partner about learning styles. He learns better when he has sufficient time to research the project beforehand. Versus I learn better when I can jump right into the code and start playing with it. These are some of the issues we discussed, and these are the solutions we implemented to combat it. 
 
 -More Pairing Session
 
 -Pat does more in depth study while I create pseudocode for the next iterations. That way I feel I'm making progress, and then we can follow my instructions together with Pats insight after doing more research. 
 
 -We divide and conquer only when we both feel secure in the portion of code we're working with.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback I gave to other people:

"During the project, Chris was able to hold his own and effectively get through projects. He was very time efficient and always came back to class with all his work done. Whenever I got stuck on a problem, he was able to help me through it, and he has strong refactoring and problem solving skills.  He was a great partner and we never had any issues during the entire project. He absolutely deserves to go onto to Mod2" -Nicole Marino, HTTP YYKM 


Ben is always willing to learn and has made amazing progress throughout the module. He's always time efficient with his assignments and never slacks off. Whenever he struggled, he got into a pairing session and put the extra effort into understanding the problems. He put in more time and effort into mod1 than most students" -Nicole Marino

Personal Scores:

2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment

I got a two on workflow, but I've set goals to improve my workflow and mechanics earlier in this portfilio.  

3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

One area that I wanted to focus on was testing. For JungleBeats, most of the notes were centered around my poorly labeled tests. The next project I scored a 4 on testing. I think this shows an accurate upward slope. I also really struggled with enumerables at the begining of the module, but I feel very comfortable with them now. 

3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

One of my partners provided feedback that I believe represents my ability to work as a team on a project. 

3:Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above-and-beyond supports of the community.

I was consistant with my duties as a turing student, but I also helped Sonia with cleaning out the fridge, and I did one-on-one meetings with other 1605 students to help on iterartions of projects I had already completed. 

3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

Halfway through headcount I received feedback that I was taking too much control over the project. I believe that since that feedback was given, I let go of some of my control freak tendencies. I also provided feedback for my last partners portfolio. 


### Being a Community Member

"Nicole is a great person to have in Turing. She was always willing to help when I had questions and made sure that I understood what was going on before she left.  She understands what is going on and is able to effectively to communicate her ideas whenever she is asked.  I think that Nicole is a good addition to Turing and will progress nicely though the remaining mods." -Ben Pepper 

Feedback from Chris - HTTP-YYKM:

"Great job with quickly completing the portions to which you had committed on a daily basis. Great job setting expectations with scheduling our time to work together. Great job doing a "divide & conquer" approach which brought together our strengths and minimized our individual weaknesses. Finally, great job in collaborating to pass the project!

Areas to improve or consider in future group work: You tend to move very quickly, which is great, but also not so great because your Ruby syntax is not (yet) easy to follow (in HTTP-YYKM the culprits were long methods and mixed classes). Because of this, it would take up to an hour of reviewing your recent work to understand what was going on (admittedly, I have a lot to learn in Ruby as well). We ended up passing far too many objects through methods and classes. I would suggest that in future group work that you pair directly with your project partner for at least the first 3-4 hours that you work together in order to set the scope and syntax tone for the rest of the project code base. It would also help to have a short "review" of 15 minutes per day where each person explains their recent work. This would all help in ability to refactor code together to make the syntax and code structure more neat and divided by responsibilities.

Our approach of you forging ahead on the next new item, while I refactored and tested edge cases for the old, worked in completing the project. However, I feel like we could have ended with much neater and concise code if we had done at least 1 direct pairing session per day which involved a little refactoring before moving ahead.

Finally, it was nice working with you because you kept a pleasant attitude even during stressful times. You're talkative, I'm quiet, you tend to bring up jokes and asides, while I'm more serious... it worked out well. Our communication was great throughout the project. Thank you!"


### Playing a Part
* Cleaned Every Friday
* Always tried to pick up dishes and other miscellaneous things around turing to upkeep the general cleanliness of Turing.
* Always tried to help my fellow students when possible.
* Contributed insightful points during gear up to move the conversation along.


### Final Thoughts:
I think I should pass because I've shown a great understanding of ruby concepts and do not feel like I am struggling to understand the lessons. I have a solid foundation when it comes to the algorithms and logic behind the code. Although there were a few hiccups in my progress, I consistently show hard work and dedications, and the issues I have to work on are not an issue of a lack of understanding, but rather fixable solutions that will not affect me if I am passed on to mod2. I don't view these hiccups and a lack of understanding, but rather something I can push through during my time here at Turing.
