# Zack Forbing - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

  In Module 2, I feel like it's time to get serious about personal management. my discipline and will power as
 far as managing my time isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, but with Andrew's description of the mod, it seems like we will get daily opportunities to flex those muscles. In addition to that, I'd really like to focus on areas of coding that I feel weak on.

  Having written the former paragraph before the mod really cranked up the juice, I feel
like I could have made better use of my time during some particularly stressful times. Going forward, I intend to continue sharpening my skills while acknowledging my perceived shortcomings and using them as points of reference in which to improve.

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

* Got a little ahead of himself and needed to slow down at times.
* Testing came along with a little prompting
* Overall a decent general understanding of rails / request/response cycle but I asked him to write the blogpost on that topic to solidify the idea.

### Work

After the blitzkrieg of project after project in mod 1, the homework-driven pace of mod 2
was sometimes hard to follow. I felt like I should be doing more. That quickly changed when we got into Rails. I really enjoy Rails, and the projects this mod were a blast and incredibly informing. Rush Hour with Pat Wentz and Garrett Smestad went incredibly well, we all seemed to go with the flow, and the project felt like it was over with before we knew it. Little Shop with Nicole Marino, Matt Campbell, and (again) Garrett Smestad went similarly. it may have had to do with having an extra person on the project, and being able to co-pair at the same time, but I never felt as overwhelmed on the projects as I did with just the overall volume of information I was fed this mod.

#### Sinatra CRUD: Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/robot_world)

This project was fun, and frustrating, and currently, feels like I did it roughly ten years ago. I completed base functionality, but I think I might want to revisit it over break week, even having moved on to Rails. might be good practice to re-create it in Rails too.

#### Tool Chest

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/tool_chest)

Tool Chest was frustrating. The amount of material we covered in this project felt mountainous, and the lessons we had based around it felt rushed - understandably, because the amount of material covered WAS mountainous. It was hard to keep up, and I encountered issues completing it due to missing small details in class and not being able to get past the errors I encountered. another opportunity for revisitation for break week to really drill CRUD and ActiveRecord into my head.

#### MixMaster

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/mix_master)

MixMaster was a horse of a different color. I heard a lot of grumbling and groaning about it being a tutorial, but it worked really well for me. I worked through the entire project and felt like it taught me a lot about relationships, RSpec, and I found the Spotify OAuth section particularly enlightening.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/idea_box)

I struggled with IdeaBox. I didn't know where to go with it. it felt similar to the jump from Flashcards to NightWriter in mod 1 - going from a project of "do this" to "figure it out" is apparently difficult for me. I also had my biggest struggle of the mod on this, keeping myself on track, and knowing it wouldn't be graded made me rationalize not finishing. I did implement Hound on it for the extension, even though it wasn't completed. of the projects that I've mentioned revisiting over break week, this one is one that I HAVE to complete.


## Team

### Projects

The only graded projects we had this mod were our two team projects, Rush Hour and Little Shop. I was teamed with Pat Wentz and Garrett Smestad on Rush Hour, and Nicole Marino, Garrett Smestad, and Matt Campbell on Little Shop.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pwentz/rush_hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was our first project of the mod, and steeped in relationships, JSON payloads, ActiveRecord, and HTTP requests. I felt like the project went rather smoothly, and Pat, Garrett, and I were a great team together, encountering few issues we could not best. I could have driven more and thus could have gotten more out of it, but I feel I have a pretty solid understanding of the project's concepts.

Assessed By: Andrew

###### 1. Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills base expectations

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

###### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

###### 6. View Layer
  3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

###### 7. Workflow (NOT GRADED)

2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.

###### Feedback from Rush Hour (names not provided to me):

I think you were the catalyst in making the key decisions that prevented us from racking up too much technical debt in the early iterations, allowing us time to go back, refactor, and polish everything off. I also don't think anybody else in the group could have tackled the CSS the way you did, it came out great.

Zack Forbing demonstrated a fairly thorough understanding of Ruby and the new material (i.e., databases and relationships). He was crucial in figuring out how to do the project's attribute validations, worked on our CSS and the HTML in views, and did a fair amount of driving. I think he could continue to practice and learn about CSS and HTML in order to improve his skills in those areas, but he certainly knows enough to get the job done.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/westeros_outfitters)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop was a total beast. However, given we had an extra person in our group (every other group had 3 while we had 4), I think we handled everything that was thrown at us relatively effectively. This project was our first real immersion in Rails, dealing with most every element of building a web store from scratch, focusing on the MVC model and POROs to divide responsibilities.

###### Notes:

All features are implemented with two extensions
Refactor flash messages
Validate association not foreign_key
Controllers look good - small refactorings
Models look really good
Missing some model test coverage
Workflow looks good - need to delete branches after using

#### Evaluation Criteria

###### 1. Feature Completeness
  4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

###### 2. Views
  3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

###### 3. Controllers
  3.5
  4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
  3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

###### 4. Models
  4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

###### 5. Testing
  3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

###### 6. Usability
  4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

###### 7. Workflow
  4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

###### Feedback from Nicole Marino, on Little Shop:
You are one of those people that are willing to take on any portion of the project. Styling, logic, you name it. It comes in handy when trying to figure out who can do what. You know the material well, and when you don't know the answer you're quick to ask. I don't see any really concerning issues, I think you were a great addition to the team. If I had to come up with something you could work on, it would be spend some time reading other peoples code and reading the stack. That way you can build off of it. And do more research into CSS, it might come in handy.

###### Feedback from Matt Campbell, on Little Shop:
Working with Zack was a pleasant experience.  His determination to get the project to be as best as we can was an awesome standard to try to meet as we worked together.  Zack's ability to keep the mood fun while working long hours made pairing with him very easy.  I enjoyed working together because Zack is always great about communicating what he is thinking and not afraid to try other's ideas while driving.  Overall, it was a great experience.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback to Pat Wentz, on Rush Hour:
Pat was a great team member, doing his best to explain his thought process when discussions on how to proceed came up. He has an uncanny ability to think around problems, communicated well throughout the project, as well as unofficially led the team. He has a singular focus that is mostly good, but when he gets sucked into a tangential problem it seems like it's hard for him to tear himself away from it. his workflow skills are impeccable, and he made sure to let us know what he was working on when we were separated so we didn't have a whole lot of git merges to endure. Overall, Pat is a pleasure to work with!

###### Feedback to Garrett Smestad, on Rush Hour:
Garrett was a fountain of knowledge during this project, always researching and googling. Garrett didn't drive much, seeming to prefer having input and discussion about what we should do. He and I could both benefit from being more comfortable in the driver's seat. Garrett's communication was really good about what he was working on when we were separated (avoiding tons of git merges), but missed the mark a bit about being on time. it didn't seem to matter with the three of us, however, as it seemed like we were unstoppable when we worked as a trio. Garrett was also quick to remind us if we were getting pulled off course by some tangential problem. Overall, Garrett was a valuable member of the group and a pleasure to work with.

###### Feedback to Matt Campbell, on Little Shop:
Matt, your previous life as a mascot is still in you. during this project you have kept the mood high and light, even when you're frustrated. I think that's an incredibly valuable gift. You were also always willing to help on a spot where I was stuck, and I appreciated that a lot. Your work ethic while having a kiddo at home that keeps you up at night is impressive, and I really enjoyed our pairing sessions early on, and group attacks later in the project. you have an agreeable personality, and if you don't know the outcome of a certain pathway, that doesn't stop you from trying it. Overall, you were indispensable for Little Shop, and I look forward to pairing with you again!

###### Feedback to Garrett Smestad, on Little Shop:
Garrett, once again you have shown your incredible problem solving skills and dogged determination to find solutions to our problems. You were great on Rush Hour, and Little Shop hasn't been much different in that regard. Your skill in sniffing out small errors that are easily missed is unparalleled. Your willingness to work late into the night (and produce amazing code through it) will serve you well, but don't forget to take pomodoros! fresh eyes are always beneficial, and I'm just as susceptible to that, so together we didn't take many breaks. You seemed to be more willing to do almost anything for Little Shop, whether it was testing, css, troubleshooting, or anything else. just as in Rush Hour, it was a pleasure to work with you again.

###### Feedback to Nicole Marino, on Little Shop:
Nicole, you've been indispensable during Little Shop. your project management skills and vigilance for getting stuck in rabbit holes is second to none. I appreciated your plainspoken honesty about the direction of the project, but you also seemed happy to go with the flow at times as well, which was valuable in a group of four people. It would have been nice to see you hang around longer, but I understand that others have more responsibilities than I do currently! I also think it would do you well to take your syntax a little more seriously. Employers will be looking at that kind of stuff, but I feel like I'm nitpicking at that point, because you did a great job!

### Miyamoto Posse

Miyamoto posse has begun to develop a game! We didn't get a whole lot of time to work on it so far, and I'm sure that will continue to be the way of it, but we have a clear concept of what we want the game to be, so now is the time to begin implementing it. It has been an interesting experience trying to corral in feature creep and a desire for awesome graphics in the group right off the bat, when I'm more interested in learning the concepts of game dev. As a previous designer I know how easy it is to get bogged down trying to make something look good, and I'm also aware that without great development, all the jaw-dropping graphics in the world won't make your app good. I see myself taking more of a leadership role in the posse as Ryan Batty and Parker Phillips will be leaving after next mod.

### Playing a Part

I participated in as many 1606 pairing sessions as I could fit in. I didn't get my name on all of them, but it was pretty close. I paired with Kinan, Calaway, Gabi, and Alisher (twice). I also went to Impostors lunches when I could, and was thrust into leadership of one of them (which REALLY made me feel that Impostor Syndrome!). I also took part in HackDesign lunches, but fell off near the end of the mod when my lunch time became more like "project time plus burritos".
