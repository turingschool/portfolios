### Areas of Emphasis

Before I got to Turing, I set out to "learn how to learn." I've tried learning languages on my own in the past - small amounts of javascript, html & css - but I wasn't able to really speak the language, let alone write poetry with it. that was how I described the learning process in the midst of the module, as learning a second language, and simultaneously having my ability to write poetry in it be scrutinized.
After getting here, however, I realized I needed to learn less generalized practices. TDD, DRY, TRUE, SRP have all been driving factors in my projects, even if I didn't end up having enough time to implement them fully. These principles continue to drive my coding behavior, and learning the way I have at Turing, that's not going to change anytime soon.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: What Can I Make

Notes:

* In a good spot overall; comfortable with the fundamentals -- making classes, methods, objects,
working with ivars, etc
* Generally able to pick the right choice for a data structure or method; if we picked something weird
we realize it quickly and correct
* Still forgetting ends here and there and having minor syntax trip ups
* main area for improvement would be continuing to get a little quicker at synthesizing the multiple steps
required to put together a more complex process -- e.g. taking a process we had outlined for a single thing
and applying it to a collection of those things

Scores:

###### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
  3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

###### 2. Completion and Progress
  3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

###### 3. Testing
  3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

###### 4. Workflow
  3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

###### 5. Collaboration
  3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

###### 6. Enumerable & Collections
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

I've never felt like I've worked harder at anything in my life than I have worked on my projects here at Turing. Similarly, I've never felt so consumed by problems nor as elated at successfully figuring something out. My cohort worked on four projects this module, starting with solo projects Flashcards and Nightwriter and finishing with the two paired projects HTTP (paired with Ben Pepper) and Headcount (paired with Trent Whitinger).

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

this project was a challenge at the time. by the end of it, though, I felt like I had been strapped to a rocket in terms of my level ruby knowledge. felt like going from zero to 60. I enjoyed the level of camaraderie I experienced with the rest of the cohort working late on this project in good ol classroom A.

Assessed By: Horace

Notes:

Overall solid project making good use of ruby fundamentals, demonstrating comfort and proficiency defining classes, defining methods, tracking and updating instance variables, etc
did good job managing the I/O throughout the program
Enum capabilities seem to be coming along
OOP structure is coming along, just still showing fairly large concentration of the program's overall logic into 1 dominant class, talked about ways to start looking for that pattern and identify additional classes or methods that can be pulled out to share some of this responsibilty.
Scores:

###### 1. Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

###### 5. Enumerable & Collections
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Nightwriter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/nightwriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This project introduced me to many brick walls to bang my head against. unlike Flashcards we weren't given a distinct roadmap to start from, and I wrestled with that a lot. It was the first time I'd worked truly late here at Turing, with the last two days before the project assessment being 14 and 18 hour days respectively. ultimately I wasn't able to complete the extensions necessary for a 3 in functionality, but I was pretty proud of my testing score.

Assessed By: Jorge TÃ©llez

Notes:

He started thinking about immutability using constants in his tests.
He used inheritance to share functionality among classes.
Created a support folder to store the text files that he was using in his tests.
Overall, I think he has the right instincts and good handling of abstractions. With a bit of guidance, he'll do really well. I think he'll enjoy reading POODR.
Scores:

###### 1. Overall Functionality
  2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

###### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

###### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Team

### Projects

Two paired projects were assigned during the module. On the first, HTTP, I was paired with Ben Pepper. For Headcount, I was paired with Trent Whitinger.

#### HTTP (Yeah You Know Me!)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

HTTP was the first paired project of the module. Ben was off to a running start, making sure to pair with lots of upperclassmen, while I struggled a bit in he beginning, but we took a two-heads-are-better-than-one approach. My understanding of the project skyrocketed near the end and we finished strong, but testing was a weakness for me because of the seeming complexity of using Faraday to test.

Notes:

###### 1. Overall Functionality
  3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

###### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
  2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

###### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

Feedback from Ben:
Zack is incredibly positive and realistic to work with. It was a pleasure working with him.  I think we were able to play off each other well during HTTPYYKM.  Near the end of the project Zack was very confident in his skills and was able to explain what was going on to me when I was lost. He understands ruby quite well and I have the utmost confidence that Zack will continue to be a fantastic member of the Turing Community.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Headcount was a real kick in the teeth. We had a roadmap with this one, but the ultimate goal of the project wasn't initially clear. It was difficult for me to get started again, but Trent walked me through the beginning steps and it has really started to click with me about what TDD really is. you're given some parameters...so build them! Every step of the way, this project was a challenge.

Feedback from Trent:
Zack has a great focus on using test driven development to guide decision making. He has a strong work ethic, always willing to stay late and finish up a particular problem when necessary throughout the two week final project. He displayed true grit completing headcount and refactoring it up to spec, great job Zack!

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Tommasina Miller:
Tommasina has been a constant source of smiles and positivity all module. The night before Flashcards was due, we were all working in classroom A, trading tips about what worked well for us. I had just finished the project, and accidentally deleted some code without noticing that broke the entire project. I was panicking a bit, but Tommasina calmly sat down with me and helped me filter through my code to see what had happened. I am extremely thankful that she was there that night.

Feedback for Ben Pepper:
Ben was a great partner to pair with during HTTP. He was instrumental in getting our coding flow started, as well as provoking creative flow  throughout the project and helping to lead us down successful pathways I wouldn't have considered. I felt like we meshed pretty well, and our two-headed-attack, dynamic-leadership pairing style helped us rock out the project while also having fun and not taking anything too seriously. Ben also secured us many pairing sessions with advanced students when we were struggling where I might have continued to bang my head against the proverbial wall.

Feedback for Trent Whitinger:
Trent helped me throughout this project understanding things that didn't make sense, and getting me started when I wasn't sure where to begin. his work ethic and focus are admirable, and his comfort with venturing into the unknown is impressive. His ability to test and then quickly build out complex functions was incredibly valuable for Headcount. Overall, Trent has definitely shown that he has what it takes to be an incredible programmer.

Feedback for Raphael Barbo:
Raphael was a blast to work with during our Pairing Patterns lesson. We seem to have similar mindsets but different approaches. We had fun together, but we also kept each other on task. we came up with creative solutions to the robot test, and had a great time doing it. Raphael is a great coder to pair with, and I look forward to more sessions with him.

Feedback for David Whitaker:
David is a great resource for us noobs at Turing. His student-led session on git workflow was incredibly informative and helpful to those of us who attended. We not only learned about git flow, but terminal customization that has saved me lots of typing during Headcount. Thanks David!

### Being a Community Member

from Raphael Barbo:
Zack was very easy to work with during our afternoon pairing. I absolutely loved brainstorming with him, and finding different approaches to the same problem - he definitely thinks outside of the box, and we were able to progress productively and quickly during our assignment. I am definitely looking forward to more pairing sessions with him. Definitely a like-minded peer.

### Playing a Part

Ben Pepper and I helped Marissa Smith's parents move into their new house in Johnstown.
I also assisted in fridgepocalpyse 2016 along with Sonia Gupta and others.
I was here every day I could be, barring a couple weekend days where I needed to take a break for a hike, and if I know a helpful tip or trick, I will share it with you!
