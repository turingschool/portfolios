# (Patrick Wentz) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

## Mission Statement
Coming into Turing I expected to be challenged, but that's the reason I chose this school. 
### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I hadn't done much programming before Turing, but prior to coming in I feel that I had enough tools
to be able to keep myself from completely struggling. Therefore my goal this Module was to show enough
progress so that I wouldn't be forced to repeat Module 1. The first week I struggled heavily with command queries
and mythical creatures, and the idea of classes and objects didn't quite click after the first week.
However I was able to really put in extra time over the first weekend, which allowed me to feel
confident and prepared for our first project.

Challenge:
Option 2, What Can I Make

Notes:
- Syntax: would like to see Hash.new(0), weighing of multiple approaches for addressing an issue

The first project seemed very daunting at first, however I had done enough of the command query and mythical
creatures exercises to really excel through the first three iterations. This allowed me enough time to focus on one of
the more difficult (at least at the time it seemed) extension where I was able to write a dynamic text file. Unfortunately
I spent so much time trying to generate a text file that looked neat and provided a pleasant user experience that I
neglected the style aspect of the code itself. After the project I began to understand the importance of keeping your classes simple
and purpose driven. I'm still learning about when to assign an attribute vs creating an entirely new method for an object's purpose.


Notes:
Assessed by: Horace

- solid project demonstrating competency with fundamental ruby concepts and mechanics of OOP
- looked a couple small ruby style points around boolean expressions; talked about consistently re-using method logic that has                 already been implemented
- like seeing the enums you are using (lots of map, even a little zipping going on)
- going forward, bigger stylistic points we talked about involved avoid tracking unnecessary data in instance variables and
  looking for opportunities to extract new classes with specific responsibilities wherever the opportunity arises
- testing is looking good, but would like to see more of it

(evaluation scores)

1. Functional Expectations
  4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

2. Test-Driven Development
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

5. Enumerable & Collections
  4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### (Night Writer)

  For me, NightWriter was a defining moment of growth in my first module. When I started NightWriter I quickly focused on getting through the functionality aspect of the project first and foremost, without really any regard for proper mechanics. It wasn't until this moment that I realized that my progress as a developer was much different than others around me. I didn't struggle mightily with the problem solving aspect, but rather the way I chose to solve a particular problem. I quickly found a way to implement what the spec was asking for, however I wasn't aware of what the instructors were looking for in terms of proper Ruby style. I didn't realize this until the day before the project was due. So for the sake of education, I tried to go back and refactor my project towards what the instructors were looking for - using less ivars and more passing local vars, less loops and more enums. Despite the fact that I did a decent job of breaking the logic into different classes, I couldn't finish the product in time for my evaluation. With that said, I don't feel as if my scores on this project is reflective of my growth in a few short weeks.

  Notes:

  rewrote project last night to improve code quality
  original works, but has some opportunities to refactor
  six test

  (evaluation comments)

  (evaluation scores)
  1. Overall Functionality

  2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
  2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
  3. Test-Driven Development

  1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
  4. Breaking Logic into Components

  2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility


### (HTTP, Yeah You Know Me)

### Team: Jason Hanna
Assessed By: Rachel

Repo: https://github.com/Automatic365/http

Notes:

* all functionality for iterations 0-4 complete with no bugs


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


###Headcount

Evaluated By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/headcount/

Notes:

Ran into a merge conflict immediately before assessment -- spec harness failure, code not consolidated on one branch
I0SH: pass, I1SH: fails, I4: pass, rest failures
Group to address merge issues (touch only Headcount Analyst, Headcount Analyst Test, and merge)
Test mostly covered high-level functionality, would like to see more unit testing
Some gaps in testing, ex: parser
Test suite would not complete
Opportunities to refactor: if/else statements; code otherwise quite readable
Sanitation: lines > 80 and white space trailing lines
Re-Assessment

I0: pass, I1: error, I2: errors (file loading), 3 failed assertions
Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1. Functional Expectations

1: Application crashes during normal usage
Reassessment score: 1 (Considering the spec harness failed during the assessment and when we reviewed the code later, the reassessment score remains a 1)
2. Test-Driven Development

0: Pending re-eval
Reassessment score: 2 (Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient)
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

3: Five or fewer complaints

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(Jason Hanna: HTTP - Jason and I paired for the HTTP project, and it was great
  to work with a partner so committed to completing a project the right way in
  terms of time commitment, attention to testing, and conceptual understanding.
  With Jason's ability to step back and look at the larger scope of a project,
   our styles meshed well together and I look forward to working with him again.)

### Being a Community Member

(Pat was an amazing partner for HTTP. He is a very strong programmer, and his organization and foresight made what could have been a stressful project beyond manageable. I learned so much from him in ways to set myself up better for future projects, and assignments. He was also a clear and communicative partner which made it really easy to work together.  Beyond the project, I see Pat as a strong contributor to the Turing community. Many mod 1 students approach him for help and he is always patient and helpful.)

### Playing a Part

 1. I try to help my cohort by trying to help them and point them in the right direction, especially in areas they are struggling with.
    Despite being one of the younger members of my cohort, I push myself to be a leader and spread helpful knowledge that I find. I also made the effort to host a student-led session on terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts for the rest of my cohort for helpful tips to save time.
