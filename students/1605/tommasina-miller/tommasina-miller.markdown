# Tommasina Miller - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
 This module, I want to immerse myself in learning as much as I can about Ruby and OOP. Though I've had limited experience working with Ruby prior to starting at Turing, I am confident that I can learn the fundamentals and grow tremendously in my skills and knowledge. I can only go up from here!

 I'm excited about the opportunities for mastery in this immersive program, and I have done my best to set up my life to revolve around becoming the best programmer I can. I want to learn the breadth of the field but the depth of learning I will experience at Turing is what excited me about this program. I am anticipating this experience being extremely difficult but the empowerment I feel from these new skills will be a worthwhile reward. I hope to learn as much as I can from instructors, mentors, and other students while I'm here. In particular, I want to push myself outside of my comfort zone by challenging myself with the material, taking opportunities for public speaking, and feeling more confident in my ability to problem solve and persevere.

Blocks & Enumerations

* 3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

Workflow

Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


### Work

I've had the opportunity to work on three personal projects this module: Mastermind, Flashcards, and NightWriter. While I was perhaps overambitious in joining Echo in the first week of the module, I learned a lot from my attempt at Mastermind. Since I dropped out of that advanced track after the project, I've left my evaluation out of this portfolio.


#### Flashcard

* [Flashcard Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

* [Completed Project Repository] (https://github.com/chompasina/flashcard)

* [Flashcard Evaluation] (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/flashcards/tommasina_miller.markdown)

Assessed By: Horace

Notes:

 * Looking solid with Ruby fundamentals and basic OOP mechanics
 * Seem comfortable defining classes, methods, working with ivars, interacting between multiple classestesting is looking good -- seem to have main concepts down and be executing on them -- keep an eye on edge cases and making sure we test each scenario with a few different inputs
 * Round class was quite concise and well-implemented; talked about a few ways to possibly make it even simpler by avoiding tracking duplicative information in multiple instance variables
 * Doing this will make the code a little leaner and also give us better paths to testing some of this logic

  Scores:
  1. Functional Expectations

      3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

  2. Test-Driven Development

      3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

      3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

      3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

  5. Enumerable & Collections

      3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


#### NightWriter

* [NightWriter Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

* [Completed Project Repo] (https://github.com/chompasina/night_writer)

* [NightWriter Evaluation] (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/night-writer/tommasina-miller.markdown)

Assessed By: Jhun

Repo: https://github.com/chompasina/night_writer

  Notes: - glimpse of SRP implementation not completely there - Tests communicated to me that developer was there logically but tests were failing - Test where cascading in complexity which I liked - application could not convert from braille

Scores:
1. Overall Functionality

* 1.5: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swapping characters, changing < to <=, placing true into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.

4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


### Projects
I've worked on two projects with partners in my cohort: HTTP- Yeah You Know Me and Headcount. Both projects offered substantial opportunities for improving my technical skills and honing my collaboration skills. I have had extremely positive experiences working with my partners in defining our working relationship, deciding on the implementation of our project, and successfully executing our code.


#### HTTP - Yeah You Know Me

This was another paired project aimed at developing our skills working with servers.

Learning Goals

 * Practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components
 * Practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels
 * Understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works
 * Practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/caleb9193/http-project

Notes:

* 16 tests
* Faraday tests were not implemented
* Some opportunities to refactor were present, things like complex conditionals pulling messages out to a separate place
* Some methods/classes doing a bit too much
* really liked the runner pulled out

1. Overall Functionality

    3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

4. Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/allindow/headcount)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [Evaluation] (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/headcount/tommasina_angela.md)

Headcount was a project in which we wrote a program to parse csv data, create data hashes and perform analysis.

Learning Goals

 * Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
 * Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
 * Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
 * Connect related objects together through references
 * Learn an agile approach to building software


Evaluated By: Mike

Repo: https://github.com/allindow/headcount

Notes:

* Did Iteration 6.
* 102 runs, 140 assertions, completed in 65 seconds, 98 percent test coverage.
* Has some fixture data, cool!
* very well tested - watch for situations where hardcoding can defeat tests
* tighten up interfaces by not giving access to the kitchen sink
* Spec harness took six seconds.
* think about controlling interfaces to objects better - split incoming hashes at initialize, and dont make your own getter methods

Scores:

## Community Engagement and Playing a Part

I was physically present every day. I've participated in the Pahlka posse and attended a National Civic Day of Hacking event at which we worked on our NeighborHome app.

I helped Sonia with her fridge cleaning project and have tried to encourage my classmates when I sense they need emotional support.

### Giving Feedback

Kris never fails to ask how I'm doing if he notices me stuck on something, a kindness which I greatly appreciate. For example, although he had already finished his work, Kris stayed and helped me with my Flashcards project until late in the night when I finally finished. He asked me questions to get me thinking about the next steps and was patient with my learning process. His smiling presence at Turing cheers me on.

Caleb was a great partner during our HTTP project. Though neither one of us had built a server before, we worked through it together step-by-step. He made connections with code faster than I did, but he made sure to explain his thought process so I could keep up. His novel connections between classes and methods, and infectious excited spirit around coding encouraged our success.

Raphael often stays late working on projects and will periodically check in with me to make sure I'm doing well. He'll stop to work with me if he's ahead, a gesture which does not go unappreciated. His jovial attitude lightens the atmosphere of intense coding, and his warmth make him a great friend to have. I'm excited to see where his coding takes him!

Matt has helped me get through 4 or 5 iterations of various projects in module 1. He breaks down problems into simple pieces and is able to reiterate these problems in different ways until I understand. He can even do this with problems he himself hasn't even reached yet! His skill at coding and down-to-earth personality make him a great natural leader within our cohort.

During one emotional moment the night before a project due date, Trent gave me a pep talk that helped me get through my block. He also spent hours of a Friday afternoon re-working a project with me so that I could keep up. His self-deprecating jokes often belie his true studiousness and natural coding skill--in any case, I'm grateful for his help and his sense of humor that have brightened many work hours for me!

Sonia reached out to me during a difficult week and invited me for coffee, a sweet gesture which I really appreciated. She gave me some insights on working through code and shared from her experience, making my situation feel less dire. I've seen her working through very hard coding projects with inner strength and grace. Her leadership this module by serving as a representative on the Student Advisory Board and facilitating group retrospectives has made our posse function more smoothly. Additionally, her encouragement and appreciation of us on our group Slack channels make her a great leader within our cohort. I'm heartened that we're both in the Pahlka posse so I can continue learning from her!

Roberta cheered me up during a low moment by appreciating something about myself that I hadn't noticed. Her perceptiveness and peaceful demeanor make her a programmer to be admired and a friend to be cherished. I'm so impressed by her progress this module in excelling in Echo projects alongside our normal classwork--I know she will do great things with her strong coding skills.

Pairing with Angela for Headcount was a wonderful experience of collaboration and clear communication. Angela had patiently walked me through difficult spots of past projects, so when we were paired, I was excited for the opportunity to continue working with and learning from her. She has a very step-wise methodology for approaching problems which made it easier for me to grow my understanding of the more complex methods and class interactions. Her persistence, and doggedness even, helped us get through this long marathon of a project. That she balances family life and her mastery of these skills amazes me. I couldn't have done it without her! She is a skilled programmer even after these 6 weeks, so I'm looking forward to seeing where she goes from here!

What would I have done my first three weeks of Turing without Mark as a micro-posse mentor? Every morning without fail, he was sitting waiting for us at the pairing station. He guided me through many last-minute fixes for projects and reassured me through an entirely overwhelming period of academic growth. It's been nice to see his friendly face around Turing since then, and I really appreciate his continued willingness to help out with projects since the end of our micro-posse.

Brian was very helpful as a mentor in our micro-posse. He helped me implement several sophisticated pieces of code during our scheduled morning posse meeting times, as well as during several afternoons of extracurricular pairing sessions. I'm grateful for his help.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from others:

From Angela Lindow: Tommasina’s positivity is infectious and was invaluable during Headcount! I doubted myself and our ability to complete functionality, but she was ever reassuring and encouraging. She is dedicated to mastering any skills presented to her. She showed a strong grasp on the raw data being presented and how our program could interact with that data in different ways.

From Caleb Cowen: Working with Tommasina was very enjoyable. I was a bit concerned as it was my first pair project and I wasn’t sure how to approach it, but she led the way in the DTR and in establishing good communication right from the start. Her easy going personality and willingness to work hard and keep pushing even when we got stuck were a huge factor in the success of our project.

From Raphael Barbo:  Tommasina is one of the most inspiring people at 1605, extremely sweet, hard-working, and dedicated, Tommasina is one of my biggest inspiration, and I really loved having her in our cohort, and I really really can't wait to see the amazing things she will accomplish throughout her time at turing and thereafter. I find it to important to highlight as well, Tommasina is an amazing leader, she has a warrior soul and I would love to see her leading, organizing, and getting involved in projects, posses, and even SAB.

From Sonia Gupta: I have watched Tommasina grow so much! She began the module feeling a little unsure of herself, but she did not give up. Instead, she pushed through the doubt and feelings of discouragement and came through to the other side. Her resilience will continue to serve her throughout her time at Turing. Tommasina has also brought an incredible level of positivity and good energy to our cohort. I have been the recipient of her compassion and kindness on more than one occasion. Furthermore, her dedication to civic tech is remarkable, and I’m excited to get the chance to learn from her in Pahlka and in Module 2. Tommasina is a huge asset to the Turing community and her positive outlook will continue to serve her well.

From Zack Forbing: Tommasina has been a constant source of smiles and positivity all module. The night before Flashcards was due, we were all working in classroom A, trading tips about what worked well for us. I had just finished the project, and accidentally deleted some code without noticing that broke the entire project. I was panicking a bit, but Tommasina calmly sat down with me and helped me filter through my code to see what had happened. I am extremely thankful that she was there that night.
