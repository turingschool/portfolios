# Nate Anderson - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to create a base of knowledge with programming
that would help me progress through the remaining modules.
I focused on learning the concepts initially and fell behind
on some of the early projects but I do feel this will benefit me down the line. I now feel comfortable doing a lot of different things programming wise that I completely
did not understand in my first few weeks of the module.

Challenge:
Base
​
Notes:
​- Syntax: speed and comfort with Ruby still needs work. Ex: `if @stock[ingredient] == nil` statement can be rearranged and simplified
​- Testing: struggled initially to extract incremental tests from spec; slow to develop tests, but logic was sound, used tests to drive development
​- Workflow: typing speed could improve, but was functional; navigation through other apps was sound
- Collaboration: made effort to calibrate over certain approaches, though often hesitantly. Would like to see more active engagement, discussion of options, implications. 
- Enumerables: we didn’t get to enumerables, but this is another area for practice.
Scores:
​
#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
​* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts
​
#### 2. Completion and Progress
​* 2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.
​
#### 3. Testing
​* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
​
#### 4. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
​
#### 5. Collaboration
* 2.5: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
​
### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


### Work

My projects this module include:
Flashcards
Nightwriter
Chisel

#### Individual Projects

* https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/flashcards
* Flashcards

Create a program that will allow to create flashcards with a question and answer and be able to play a round with the user entering input and output will be produced and stored regarding if the answer is correct or not. 

Rachel gave me oral feedback since the project was late.

* https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/night_writer
* Nightwriter

Create a program that will translate braille to text and vice versa. 

Rachel gave me oral feedback since the project was late.

* https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/chisel
* Chisel

Create a program that will convert markdown text to html format and tagging.

## Nate Anderson - Chisel

Assessed By: Horace

Repo: https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/chisel

## Notes

* Very good overall
* Shows good decomposition of project into methods and classes
* Shows a lot of progress working with more complex data and figuring out ways to leverage
ruby data structures to do work for us
* Great job on the testing, especially glad to see that all of the various cases for stuff like
italics and emphasis are covered
* completed the spec as required

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 3. Functionality

* 3: Application implements all base functionality

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Team

no team projects

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I think I have a lot of room for improvement but I feel
proud of how much I have grown from the beginning of
the module until now. 

### Being a Community Member

I can become even more active than I am currently
and I will strive to be even better as I progress
at Turing.

### Playing a Part

I have told friends about Turing and with my limited
knowledge tried to help as many people out as possible 
when struggling.
