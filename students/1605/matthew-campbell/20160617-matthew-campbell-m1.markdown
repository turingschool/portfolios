Peer and instructor feedback: 3

### Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to become proficient in the Ruby programming langauge and be able to create fully functional programs.

I aimed to be the best academic student I can be, devoting as much time as I could to make sure that I am proficient with each of the lessons of the day in addition to things I learn on
my own.

I also hope to help other students in 1605 as much as I can because it will be beneficial for both parties.

I believe I achieved all of these goals and I am very proud of the progress I made in this module.

### End of Module Assessment

Mike passed us with a 4 in sanitation and 3s in all other categories.

### Work


#### Flashcards

* [Flashcards Project](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/night_writer)
* [Original Flashcards Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

The intention of this project was to create a program that allows the user to study flashcards through the terminal.

The project was designed to teach good behavior by attacking small problems and using test driven development.

**Instructor Notes:**

Fixing tests for later - will adjust score accordingly with fixed tests
Good use of setup method and sad path tests on round class
Could use some refactoring on big methods
Great work on extensions
Scores:

**Project Scores:**

*1. Functional Expectations*

4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

*2. Test-Driven Development*

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

*3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components*

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

*4. Fundamental Ruby & Style*

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

*5. Enumerable & Collections*

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### Night Writer

* [Flashcards Project](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/flashcards)
* [Original Flashcards Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

The intention of this project was to create a program that allows the user to study flashcards through the terminal.

The project was designed to teach good behavior by attacking small problems and using test driven development.

**Instructor Notes:**

Did a great job of breaking project into smaller parts. - could refactor "smaller parts" ie. procs, and modules - testing showed knowledge of problem, could accomodate edge cases

Scores:

**Project Scores:**

*1. Overall functionality*

3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

*2. Fundamental Ruby & Style*

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

*3. Test-Driven Development*

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

*4. Breaking Logic into Components*

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Projects

The projects below were paired projects for this module.

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/http/sonia_matt.markdown)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)
* [DTR](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/httpyykm/blob/master/DTR.txt)

Purpose: Build a server that accepts requests and sends responses.

**Instructor Notes:**

30 tests
Well separated code
some opportunities to refactor, look at complex conditionals and inside conditional branches
well tested, make sure that you're testing multiple cases in the future


Scores:

**Project Scores:**

*1. Overall functionality*

3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

*2. Fundamental Ruby & Style*

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

*3. Test-Driven Development*

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

*4. Breaking Logic into Components*

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


"I was lucky to have Matt as my partner this module. He was always willing to push through and get the work done, and we synchronized beautifully at times. He was patient with me when I fell behind, and he always took the time to explain his thoughts to me. He is an incredibly diplomatic and thoughtful individual who has a kind heart and a remarkable work ethic. I learned to be kinder to myself when working with him, and also learned about the importance of diving into a project with gusto. Matt is not afraid to experiment, and his enthusiasm produced some innovative solutions during our pairing. I believe that Matt’s exceptional personality, his humility, and his skill will ensure his success at Turing and in his future career." -Sonia Gupta

Purpose: Build a database/analyst that will take in school-district related data, parse it, and


**Instructor Notes:**

33 seconds to run tests,
84 tests, 143 asertions, 98.16 coverage
Look to use instance variable instead of exposing the entire hash to the outside
Extensive use of modules, to separate code, but needs to take it to the next level, some classes are a wee bit too long.
Some repetition of code especially with FILE IO stuff.
The each pattern where shovelling into a collection instead of using map
Iteration six

4: Zero complaints

“Matt is an excellent person who’s desire and willingness to work as a team and contribute is evident in every step of the project. He is enthusiastic and encouraging. He is  always will to work hard, but also willing to share responsibilities and listen to ideas.  He will do very well at Turing and I’m looking forward to working with him in the future.” - Kris Sparks

### Giving Feedback

*Sonia  Gupta*

I was lucky to have Matt as my partner this module. He was always willing to push through and get the work done, and we synchronized beautifully at times. He was patient with me when I fell behind, and he always took the time to explain his thoughts to me. He is an incredibly diplomatic and thoughtful individual who has a kind heart and a remarkable work ethic. I learned to be kinder to myself when working with him, and also learned about the importance of diving into a project with gusto. Matt is not afraid to experiment, and his enthusiasm produced some innovative solutions during our pairing. I believe that Matt’s exceptional personality, his humility, and his skill will ensure his success at Turing and in his future career.

*Kris Sparks*

“Kris is a great teammate who’s ability to feel out the atmosphere in any given moment is a great benefit to keeping the project moving forward at a meaningful pace.  He’s got a great mind for overseeing the big picture while simultaneously being able to dig into the details of the task at hand.  These two skills combined with his overall calming and fun demeanor made our pairing the most fun I’ve had yet at Turing.  He has a great ability to keep the mood light while either pushing me when necessary or reigning me in when I am off in my own world throwing TDD to the wind.  I think later at Turing or in his career he will make a great project lead and will be very beneficial resource to learn from during group projects."



### Being a Community Member

"Matt has helped me get through 4 or 5 iterations of various projects in module 1. He breaks down problems into simple pieces and is able to reiterate these problems in different ways until I understand. He can even do this with problems he himself hasn't even reached yet! His skill at coding and down-to-earth personality make him a great natural leader within our cohort."" - Tommasina

### Playing a Part

I believe I played a good part bringing high energy and morale to the overall community.  I also am jumping in on the Turing Podcast to try to keep it going as Brennan graduates because it played a big role for me as I prepped for Turing. I think it could be a useful tool to increase visibility in the greater ruby community.
