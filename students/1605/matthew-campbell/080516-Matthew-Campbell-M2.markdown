#Matt Campbell - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module my main focus is to become comfortable with Rails and ActiveRecord and to continue to be as involved with Turing as I can be.  Module 2 has much more material than Module 1 so I am going to try my best to make sure that I keep up with all of the material. Outside of technical skills I hope to keep the Turing Podcast going as well as lead the pairing sessions with 1606.

### Projects

#### Mix master

* [Github URL](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

##### Description

Mix-master was our first full-length tutorial with Rails, allowing us to practice implementing CRUD.  We also touched the Spotify API to allow users to log in to the site.  We also learned Authentication during this project.

#### Sinatra Crud

* [Github URL](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/skill-inventory-crud)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/crud_sinatra.markdown)

##### Description

Sinatra Crud was great in learning how to crud. My biggest takeaway was how MVC works.

#### Tool Chest

* [Github URL](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/tool_chest
* [Original Assignment]https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/forms_and_route_helpers_in_rails.markdown

##### Description

Tool chest was a project I worked on over several days one week this module. My biggest take aways from Tool Chest were authentication and authorization.

#### Mini-Project: Jiff-Generator

* [Github URL](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/gif_generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

##### Description

Jiff-Generator was my first self-directed rails project at Turing.  It was the first time I implemented authorization and an API in a project.  The site allows you to type in a search term to generate a gif if you are an admin.  If you are a user you can favorite any gifs on the site and if you are a visitor you can see the gifs.  As an extension Matt P and I implemented Hound into his project and attempted to implement SendGrid into mine.

###### Description:

Rush Hour is a web traffic tracking and analysis tool that analyzes HTTP request information for clients. It allows a client to gain information about their users, particularly, how the site is being used and accessed. Allows a client to register their site, accepts client data via POST request to a dedicated endpoint, and provides analytics at site and individual URL level.

###### Evaluation Comments:

### Giving Feedback

**Feedback for Chris:**

"Working with Chris was a great experience.  I certainly learned a lot of technical skills while working together on Rush Hour and he was always patient to take the time to teach them when necessary.  He was also very easy to work with and open to suggestions from anyone in the group.  Because of these qualities, the project when very smoothly.  We were also able to finish the base functionality quite quickly.  I would definitely love to partner up with Chris again in the future."

**Feedback for Yoseph:**

Yoseph - you did a good job on the front end and teaching me about partials and bootstrap.  You were awesome at taking the time to explain your thinking when pairing to work through a problem.  You have a good grasp on how the logic of our code worked.  You could improve a bit on doing the smallest steps first, but overall it was awesome to pair with you.

**Feedback for Zack:**

Working with Zack was a pleasant experience.  His determination to get the project to be as best as we can was an awesome standard to try to meet as we worked together.  Zack's ability to keep the mood fun while working long hours made pairing with him very easy.  I enjoyed working together because Zack is always great about communicating what he is thinking and not afraid to try other's ideas while driving.  Overall, it was a great experience.

**Feedback for Nicole:**

Working with Nicole was a good experience.  She was quick to jump into the project and get us moving which was beneficial because I believe she had the best grasp on the material in the beginning.  I think she could have a bit more organization while attacking problems, like writing tests, but she can often get buy without doing so because of her ability to see how things will work in her head.  Overall, working with Nicole was a great experience and I learned a lot from her during the course of this project.  We were able to keep it light and fun even when running into hurdles.  I hope we get to pair again in the future.

**Feedback for Garrett:**

Garrett was an awesome partner to have during Little Shop.  I appreciated that he enjoyed pairing while programming because typically, that is how I would prefer to work as well.  Working with Garrett was easy because he would take the time to explain his thoughts as he worked so I always knew what he was trying.  He often came up with great solutions to difficult problems to keep us moving.  It was very easy to enjoy my time while working with Garrett because of his sense of humor and ability to keep things light.

### Being a Community Member

**Feedback from Yoseph:**

I really enjoyed the atmosphere you brought to the group that showed on the start of day one. It established an environment that made me feel open to discuss topics. You did really well solving the problems that I couldn't figure out as well as being dependable on finishing what was needed, but would need more work on designing the front end (obvious since we're in the back end program). You really came in through for the save figuring out the solution to the view tests at last minute!

**Feedback from Chris:**

Working together was a pleasure, thanks! I honestly have no “negative” feedback to give. I feel like you kept the energy level of the group up (consistently more than Yoseph and I did) while we were all working together. Communication was great. Definitely don’t be shy about telling the group when you’ve worked on an issue for an hour or three. I hope we get to work together again.

**Feedback from Nicole:**

"Matt, you are awesome at keeping the teams energy up. You bust out commits like someone whose about to go over a deadline. You're an awesome navigator and logic comes easy to you. You have a a good understanding of the things we've learned, but can still come up with your own solutions using logical thinking. One thing to work on is not getting  stuck down rabbit holes. Spending more than an hour on one problem can be draining. Take a break, or ask one of the other team members for help. We're here to help solve problems, because 4 brains are better than one. Other than that, good job. Thanks for being the group d.j."

**Feedback from Zack:**

"Matt, your previous life as a mascot is still in you. during this project you have kept the mood high and light, even when you're frustrated. I think that's an incredibly valuable gift. You were also always willing to help on a spot where I was stuck, and I appreciated that a lot. Your work ethic while having a kiddo at home that keeps you up at night is impressive, and I really enjoyed our pairing sessions early on, and group attacks later in the project. you have an agreeable personality, and if you don't know the outcome of a certain pathway, that doesn't stop you from trying it. Overall, you were indispensable for Little Shop, and I look forward to pairing with you again!""
