# Cameron Buscher - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one at Turing I set out to improve my very basic foundations of HTML and CSS and be completely engaged in my learning of all new concepts, including my entire introduction to javascript.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass - Overall I felt really strong with each challenge presented to us this week. As I write this I am pending an evaluation for my third static comp, but I'm really proud of where it stands, with just some minor tweaks to make it a near-perfect recreation of the comp, but I am really happy with it. My DOM and creature challenges went well also, and I think while I could have been a little quicker, I was very proficient and efficient in my workings on them. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual this module felt very strong to me, and I was proud of everything I submitted. The four projects include Number Guesser and our three static comps.

#### Number Guesser

* [Github repo link](https://github.com/YayFiber/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was a test of our HTML, CSS and javascript skills after just one week in Turing. It was a very fun project that gave us something tangible to work on those skills for, and I really enjoyed the project. I made it all the way through phase three, and rather than stretch myself to add a phase four extension, I challenged myself to make sure all of the three phases I had done were done as well as I could at the time.

### Projects

We had three group projects this module: Linked List, Idea Box and 2DoBox. I am similarily pleased with these projects. All of my partners and I put everything we could into all of them, and I'm proud that I completed through phase three (or the equivalent, for Idea Box) for each one.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/YayFiber/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was our first card-based project. Essentially the entire goal was to take values a user input into two text fields and making a list of links. The cards were to have be interactable with read states and also deleted. This gave us practice with delagation and jquery. Kylee and I recreated the comp in a near pixel-perfect way and got through phase three.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcnamara14/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box -- Another card-based UI, this time with local storage! Fun project, and Tyler and I did it in a unique way that probably wasn't ideal (storing large strings of HTML, rather than individual objects), but it worked really well for the purposes of the project, and we killed it! Finishing pretty much everything you could finish without adding extensions.

#### 2DoBox - Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/YayFiber/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was really interesting and fun! Basically taking somebody elses Idea Box and repurposing it into a new project, and it went really well. Krista was a great partner who worked with me when I had a really full week, and we finished all through phase 3 with only a little squirliness on our 10 items at a time functionality, which I'm sure we could fix with an extra hour in the code.

## D: Professional Skills
Throughout the mod we had several professional development sessions which gave very actionable advice on how to present yourself for and navigate through the professional world.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset is a really big part of having a positive experience at Turing, and something I'm really glad was stressed so early! Setting those expectations early for myself and how I should approach this work helped me continue to grow even when I had some self doubt. Perservere and be better because of a struggle, don't fall behind because of self-doubt. It's helpful to hear that everybody experiences periods of that, even those you perceive as killing it. I just want to continue exhibiting those good thoughts and work habits as I continue.

#### Well-Being & Stress Management

* [Slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udbQS8rNQX0aM0dtxHerV30W7HGVGOcWfqOpDKVVcts/edit#slide=id.p10)

It was really nice to have this talk so early, and I think it helped me keep my focus on a couple of important aspects of my mental and physical health which in turned help me reduce my stress levels. I found that for myself, physical exercise is what keeps me balanced, so when I go long stretches without it I am often more stressed and actually tired, weirdly. Exercise has been very energizing through this module, and it's something I want to prioritize more as I advance through Turing. I felt that in times where my stress was highest was when I overbooked myself with social engagements or whatever. Having friends visit in the middle of weeks four and five was really hard to balance, and I'm still trying to recover from that.

#### Getting better at difficult things

* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

One of my favorite parts of this talk was the idea of having different categories for things in your skillset. For example: Not skilled in, mildly skilled in, and mastered. And how the key is to not ever rest on your laurels, and keep updating and refreshing all levels of your skills, even those that are in your mastered category. There's always room for improvement, technologies change, and it's my responsibility to change and grow with them.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I initially defined myself as part of the introvert side of the room, and I'm not sure how I feel about that in retrospect. I know that I really, _really_ value my alone time. I work really well as an individual and too much socialization can be really draining to me, but I also thrive on helping others in group settings like I mention down below this. It's a hard balance, and I'm maybe closer to the ambivert part of the spectrum. I like people and enjoy working with and connecting with others, but sometimes I want nothing more than to have a beer and read a book or play a video game with some headphones on. So maybe I was just craving some video games when I joined the highly-introverted side of the room that day. It was good to learn how everybody, no matter where they placed themselves, struggle with some aspect of working with others. That made me realize I may not be as introverted as I initially thought.

#### Sh\*t sandwich

This was the gear up led by mod four students about the different types of work environments we can expect to experience after Turing. They covered Large and middle size corporations, consultancies & agencies, remote jobs and startup companies. We discussed all of these, and the pros and cons of each. I definitely am more attracted to the allure of a startup, but know they can be immensely difficult and stressful environments to work in, and know that as a first job I would probably be better served working somewhere that I could pair with a mentor of sorts. I think I'll take anything I can get after Turing, and just become more picky when I have that flexibility. It'll just be great to get a job at all.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

It's hard to help many people out as a mod 1 student, but I think by just participating in Turing activities it helps spread that camaraderie that makes this school special. It was nice going to events that people put on for studying within our mod that were outside of the school, and being in a position that I could help some others prepare for the pentathlon, especially with some mythical creatures coaching. Hopefully it helped. I also really like my posse (Armstrong Posse, best posse) and as the transition period of posses happened it was cool to see people who didn't end up anywhere join our group because it was a welcoming one that does cool things each week. I feel lucky to be a part of that one.
