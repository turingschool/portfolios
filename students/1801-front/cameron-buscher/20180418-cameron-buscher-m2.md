## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

This mod for me was where I really started to enjoy programming, and more specifically javascript. I think some in this module maybe were bummed out by the lack of an actual front end for the middle two projects, but those were so important for me because they gave me a real love for the intricacies of javascript. I really loved my work this mod and feel more confident heading towards module three than I was coming to this module. 

Beyond coding I wanted to get more involved in the community here at turing and I feel like I did that in my own way. I participated in iron FE and paired extensively with both students in the mod below us and my fellow cohortmates. As I became a bit more comfortable with array prototypes I led a group session about them this last weekend on campus, and just tried to get people talking about their process. My goals this mod evolved to include the success of others and not just my own, and that helped me more than anything else has in Turing so far.

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: _4_
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: _3_
* **C: Professional Skills**: _3_
* **D: Community Participation**: _4_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _4_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

The individual projects were so exciting to me this mod. They were examples of process over product, and the work I put in on those two projects really improved my habits for working on everything else. I found a problem solving process that worked for me in other areas as well, and that was extremely helpful. Solving those two problems in my own way was a major confidence boost and is really what gave me the confidence boost I needed this module. It was super validating to do those things and understand exactly what I was doing. 

I also forced myself to struggle through those problems and really figure them out on my own (and Seamus, we made a good problem-solving team). That worked for those projects but I know it's better to eventually reach out when you're struggling for a while with something, but for those projects I was really glad I didn't do that.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

I got out of the basement more. It's too nice outside on the weekends to be in this building, and getting out and working elsewhere was really important for me and allowed me to focus more when I needed to. I really liked the freedom this mod gave me. 

Also last module I had a harder time sinking my teeth into a problem, I was too eager to look for a solution elsewhere, which was good for my learning and helped me build my toolset, but this module I was more suited to sit with my problem and work it out myself. Either with a whiteboard or on paper, I can write logic down and get a problem solved, and that was so much more beneficial to my learning. There's nothing I did this mod that I didn't understand completely. It was all my own thoughts and logic and that was extremely beneficial for my learning. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Sorting Suite was truly the most challenging project I've had at Turing yet. Not in a "I want to die" way, either, but a truly thought-provoking challenge in logical thinking. It forced me to slow down and think about problems, rather than throw shit at the wall endlessly. It was a great project, and gave me a good feel for recusion and the stack. 

It was a complete night / day experience from game time, where it was was two weeks of slowly burning my brain with canvas. Game time was a grind and this was a flash, I really enjoyed it. The work I put into this project solidified my process and prepared me well for the rest of the challenges this module presented, and hopefully challenges to come. 

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3+_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3+_
* **Functional Expectations:** _4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _3+_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Complete Me compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete me was a complete joy (sorry lol) of a project. I think the idea of a trie and nodes just made a great deal of sense to me, they're just nested objects, and as soon as you figure out the way you can get them to talk to each other you are essentially done with the project! I was really proud of my project, and overcoming the challenge of how to get the complete word property on each node to hold the actual word was a real revalation, and super exciting. It was also amazing to use it in Weathrly, seeing something I made work like that was beyond exciting.

Again, this project gave me a great fundamental level of understanding javascript logic and further developed my process into something formidable and malleable. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

My group projects were definitely the two most exhausting projects I've done here. I was completely wiped at the end of each of them, just due to the sheer amounts of hours I poured into each, it was a complete download of information each time and I feel like I learned an insane amount doing both of them. Game time was so difficult but it made learning React much easier. Navigating components is not so different from OOP, and that helped me in my understanding a lot.

The group projects this mod were really good at cementing fundamentals in my mind. They force you to talk about code with another human who has a different vocabulary to yours, and doing that makes you better when you have to think about code on your own. I need to be more patient with my partners internally. I never vocalize any struggles I'm having with my partner with them, but I need to not let slow progress on a project get me down ever. It always turns out okay and people struggle with different things. Going forward I want to be more inwardly empathetic of my partners and their situations.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Krista Handel_
* **Game:** _Breakout_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

GameTime was a really good project because of the visualization of the different objects we were dealing with. It helped me to not think about the canvas portion and instead just realize its use as a depiction of otherwise non-tangible objects. 

I think leveraging classes and constructors in this project was super helpful because it helped me understand how things talk to each other in javascript. The project, from a learning standpoint, was so valuable, but I felt like it was a real grind. It wore me out from the get-go of this module. But the knowledge I gathered from it was super rad for the rest of the module, and it gave me a good base for file structures and setting up my Weathrly in a clean way that satisfied me.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Quin Hill_
_eval scores pending_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Weathrly was a tough project for me because I really enjoyed learning React from the get-go, and yet my partner and I had a slow start and it was frustrating, then stressful. I don't like playing catch-up and much prefer starting hot and getting into a good place early. It just makes the project process easier and better for me in the long run. But we were able to put in a good amount of time later on in the week and really get our project in a very good spot, so I just needed to chill out! 

But man React is so powerful! Talk about wanting to get better at Javascript, that library is so rad and powerful, and implementing javascript in HTML is one way to get me more interested in HTML again. 

Weatherly, like GameTime, is a project that I can actually share with people and have them be interested in it and use it, which really feels great and provides another outlet for my insane need for validation (I wonder if anybody is still reading to this point).

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Feedback 2_
  * _Storytelling II_
  * _Feedback III_
  * _Outreach & Networking_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

The professional developments this mod were great! They felt very focused and constructive and were packed with helpful advice. I feel like I became incrementally better at telling my story again this mod, and I have started to flesh out a plan for getting more involved in the Denver coding community. I'm planning on volunteering at Dinosaur JS and going to some meetups for javascript groups, because more than anything I want a job working in javascript. I definitely feel more confident about using my people skills in the future to help me get a job.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy and Privelege_
  * _Group Think_
  * _Fake news_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

Gear ups seem designed to just change or tweak (enhance) our ways of thinking. No matter the context, it's just important to keep our brains evolving and not get locked up in certain ways of thinking. I think I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the group think gear up. There was a lot of good discussion in my room for discussing that topic, and it was particuarly interesting because it had become a talking point in the cohort in days leading up to that discussion. We were all working on algorithmic projects separately but together and when a group whiteboarding session happens there is a definite feeling of groupthink. We all feel like we're on the correct path, then attempt it and find it to be completely baseless.

I definitely felt this modules gear ups will be helpful and easy to carry with me into the future, and I hope others felt the same.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I was really involved in turing this mod. I paired with mod one so much that I had to eventually take myself off the pairing sheet because I was being bombarded and needed to focus on myself. I also helped with a couple of the mythical creatures sessions for mod 1, trying to get them more comfortable with solving those problems. 

I also got super into Iron FE and went to all but maybe two of those. Array prototypes quickly became my favorite thing this module and I became strong enough in them to pair with others in my class as well and help them feel more comfortable with them. I even led a weekend session on objects and arrays this most recent weekend, which was helpful for me and I help others to solidify their learning.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

Over break I want to solidify React, specifically testing it. I'd like to recreate a project I did in module one completely in React and test it, and maybe make something completely new and different in React as well!

Next inning I am really excited to have personal projects to conceptualize and bring to fruition! I also know the final assessment is an eight-hour all-day marathon but I am kind of excited for the challenge of that. 

Over break week I am going to Portland to visit my parents and run in a half marathon with my dad, so I'm excited about that because it will be a challenge and hopefully kickstart me back into running more. My running habits have kind of dimmed this module and that has made me pretty sad actually, but I'll fix it and kill it next mod!
