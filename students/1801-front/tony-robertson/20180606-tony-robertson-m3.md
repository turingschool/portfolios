# (Tony Robertson) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into mod 3  I was hoping to develop strong skills in React and Testing.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects include: 
* **SwapiBox**
* **PersonalProject**

### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/swapi-box)

Swapi Box was the first time I set my main focus on testing. Really learning more about Jest, figuring out how to handle async testing, ect. It really solidified my testing ability. 

##### Evaluator: Will

#### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

#### Code Quality

* 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

#### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

#### Testing

* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Workflow

* 3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

### devsGIVEback / Personal project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/devs-give-back)

##### Evaluator: Christie

#### Completion

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

#### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

* **HeadCount2.0**
* **MovieTracker**

### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/headcount2.0)

HeadCount2.0 was the first three person pairing project we worked on. We used react and made api calls while working on our prop drilling. The three person project dynamic was interesting and I think it was an overall productive way of working.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

This was a great eye opener that had a lot of very serious discussions. It's made me more mindfull to be aware of my own microagressions.

#### code debugging the gender gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Discussions for this session was great and gave me some insight on how we can be more inclusive of all genders in this industry.

#### Mod 4 Leads

* [Public Data/Civic Tech](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/public_data.md)

Even though this was titled public data we talked a lot about civic tech. It was amazing to see the different projects that exist in civic tech. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Leading weekly sessions of Iron FE was an amazing experience. It wa a struggle to see if I was getting through to them but I think they came out stronger from it. I continue to be a helpful member of my own cohort.
