For me my coding school experience started when I watched Dan Rather Reports, "Dev Boot Camp", back in 2013.

This report stuck stuck a cord with me and I remember it today. At the time I wanted to take some web classes but was very disillusioned with schools when
thinking about going to a coding bootcamp. In total I spent several years thinking about going to a bootcamp. Several things happened where I finally decided to go. 
It is really hard to believe that 7 months have gone by but it has been 192 days. When I started Turing I was walking to 
school in 0 degree weather now it's the middle of summer. Part of me wants to feel the comfort of knowing I will be at a 
specific place. For some reason I want to reset my experience back to mod 1 but am also glad that I won't be in the time warp.
I am also pretty sure that I will get 8 hours of sleep every night. Overall, I am not sure how to feel 
about the program as it comes to an end but I know that I have committed easily more than a 1000 hours in the infamous Turing basement.
 I am just really glad it was the "new fancy basement" rather than the old one under the Patagonia basement on 15th where I did my try turing. 

## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Building a node server and finally utilizing a database were probably my two biggest achievements this module. 
I feel good that I have gone through an experience of building server. Before this mod I was really intimidated by
 them and I had this feeling of it being so foreign I would would never touch it but I also felt that I wanted to do
  more than just stuff on the front-end. I really like the fact that now I can follow data from a form, to event, to state/store and db
  and back to the client. It feels good.  
 
## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

For me one of things that I struggle with is coming up with a complete process in how I approach the job hunt.
I always try to find the best answer to a problem. However, sometimes this prevents me on taking concrete steps forward.
I really want to keep in touch with the Turing staff and Katie as well as taking the best ideas going forward.
Asking around I really feel if I put in a plan in place I will be more effective in my job hunt.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I feel that my capstone has set me apart from my peers. I really like that it I took up a project idea that was not mine.
I also really like that I could develop my application further and within a relative short time I could take it to demo
in an actual museum.    

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Well, as I stated earlier I was wanted to begin to learn databases. Since the projects in module 4 are an accumulation of all the skills and including 
a backend they take the most time but they are also the most fulfilling since you are building a complete experience for a user. It had an impact that I can deliver
a complete experience. This combined with experience with laying out with a UX process

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
In order of appearance in my Turing experience. I guess overall what I learned from Turing is that I should not feel 
that I can't learn a new technology. In effect, what I feel Turing has taught me is that I should distill a new technology down
to some fundamental parts and get into using the technology as quickly as possible.  

- "You have to lean into it" - Leta Keane
- If I know my input and I know my desired output. I am not lost.
   If I hit a wall I need to break down the problem again
   I need to new inputs and outputs. - Cody Shel
- "Sometimes you just try to pound this in your head...What is it?" - Will Mitchell
- I need more confidence in that I can figure out the problem. - Christie Lynam
- I feel now that in the end coding is two things. Understanding context and problem solving with syntax.
