## Partner Feedback

I also wanted to share your feedback from Angela on linked list…“I thought we had a strong finish and overall our project was great. I know we had a rough start with git/github in the beginning but we were able to figure it out together and move on to the next thing. I know you have more knowledge than me, especially with the html and css and some programs, so i appreciate you being patient with me while i tried to troubleshoot and code our issues. There were times where it felt like you were trying to fix some of the code I had done instead of discussing it.  It would be great to approach those situations by asking more questions so we can each share our thought process.  We had some struggles with JS and JQuery but we were able to finish all of the phases and do good on the project. Yay us!”


#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/CamArturo/idea-box
* Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

In this project, we build a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas.
Partner: Tony Robertson

## Student: Camilo and Tony
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### html
- Form with role of form is apparently not redundant
- Great strides toward accessibility, with great uses of aria-label
- Someone tell me what the other meta tag is for?

### css
- Would like more specific organizational comments. - custom styles isn't telling me anything, I'm assuming all of the styles are custom
- BEM names should be more based on functional components
- Break out duplicate rules into more broad element classes and ovveride where necessary using modifier classes

### js
- Love the name of the constructor function
- Break out duplicate blocks of code into a function (ie. changeTitleStorage and changeBodyStorage could be one function that takes an argument of 'title' or 'body', increase and decrease quality functions also share a ton of code)

### git/github
- Love that there are 52 commits
- Could say more in each commit

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

We worked very well together.  I felt we both had a lot of strengths in certain areas and were able to guide each other through the challenges we faced. I really enjoyed your dedication to the project and you willingness to put in the time to knock out progress right away. You're passion to fully understand the subject matter is inspiring and something to look up to within myself. Being so dedicate and knowledgeable you have learned ways of doing things a certain way. As for coaching, working with others will sometimes present moments where your partner uses different concepts or methods. You adapted well with me and I'm sure you will in the future. Just remember to be open to new ideas!

### Gear Up

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md]()

Am I doing anything that causes the reduction of cognitive resources? If you hold things
in you also reduce your cognitive resources. AKA using willpower = Losing Cognitive processing.
Where there is a high level of expertise there is a great deal of cognitive resource management.

When you don't make progress. There are too many things draining cognitive resources.
You want to master skills as quickly as possible.

You should fix things taking too much cognitive resources.
Don't learn everything! 
Split skills into subskills. 
Subskills should be able to do be done within 3 sessions of 45-90 minutes.
It is really important to take skills and move them into mastered as quick as possible. 

Also, we learned that brains are great at pattern matching but it is subconscious. To learn by 
pattern matching we need high-quality examples, small, diverse, excellent examples. 

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown]

This gear up was interesting because we all know that everyone is different but sometimes we
do not consider how everyone reacts another person with more or less introversion. Ellen
had a highly interesting quote where extraverts and introverts did not have high opinion
about being introverted or extraverted. People just need to keep in mind how people 
see each other and store energy.

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md]

I learned that personally I have a tell when I am too stressed. I speak as if the world 
is going to end. It was nice to speak candidly with people on how they deal with stress.
I feel that if we learn how we deal with stress we stop the spiral downwards when there is
too much stress.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown]

When I reflect on what brought me to Turing I think of a lot of reasons but I do find it
amazing that I am here. I have thought about going to a bootcamp since 2013 when I watched
the interview with Dan Rather and the founder of dev bootcamp. I guess I am here at Turing
for as much as the community as the hard skills learned. I feel that I do well in a 
structured environment, which Turing provides in a sense but it is also not so structured
that I won't struggle as a developer and develop as a person. 



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I do think Turing has a great community. The biggest way I supported the Turing community 
during Mod 1 mod was to help my classmates. I do want to take a more active role during
Mod 2. I tried to always offer help when anyone asked.  
In the future I would like to attend more Turing events. 
Mod 1 went by fast in a sense of participating in the community.
