## Areas of Emphasis

**What was your learning focus this inning?** 

My ultimate learning goal has always been application development. I have always known that I want to focus efforts this
 inning was learning React. However, since joining Turing I learned that about TDD. A primary goal of mine is that I want
 to learn how to implement TDD development effectively. 

**What technical and communication skills did you want to grow?** 

I wanted to grow my ability to speak about my code.
 
**Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?**

Yes. I completed my first react project. 
I did increase my vocab and my ability to discuss code clearly. I do know that I need to stick to
 only using the correct terminology to discuss code with classmates so that it becomes normal.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning._

**Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)?** 

Only the last project helped me learn React. GameTime and Weathrly allowed me to start to form my ability to 
learn Test Driven Development. It is a really great feeling to complete a new project that includes new skills
that you learned.

**What was the most challenging?**

I felt that shifting to Test Driven Development is the most challenging. I always 
feel that front-loading your decisions while developing your application is difficult.

**What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?**

As I said before I want to only discuss my code with correct terminology. I also want to become a 
daily practice of coding every morning just to learn. I feel since I completed several projects. I 
want to continue coding daily. I want to do continue to do code-wars daily.

**What do you plan to change?** 

Now that I have the knowledge and ability to make react applications I want to 
develop side project and start to continue to projects outside of Turing. By having side projects will
allow me to develop a rounded developer abilities.

### Study Habits

**What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one?** 
    
During this inning I developed a daily study habit of doing practice coding problems. I code more frequently 
because the projects are larger and I am more used to coding daily. I also started to appreciate time boxing. 
I received feedback from one of my instructors to place a limit on different things I focus on. This will help 
you push forward your projects by knowing the take time to focus on both of them. It will help you take extra 
steps to move your project forward that you wouldn't take otherwise. I also attended Iron FE.

**What stayed the same?**
I attended all classes, completed all projects, and attended all personal development sessions.
 
**Do your study habits serve you well?** 
I do feel that my updated study habits are starting to help me accelerate my learning my
application development. 

Yes, but I feel I can continue developing daily study habits. In the past I used to not like doing coding challenges
 like codewars it but now I look forward to solving them.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

**What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging?**

Sorting Suite was a really good set of problems. It was a great project, and gave me a good feel for recursion and the stack. 

**How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly?**
I was not able to work together with any of my classmates until late Tuesday. Therefore, it was a high pressure environment
to learn how recursion works and the call stack. 
 
**How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?**
For Weathrly, it was a paired project. The work I put into this project solidified my process and prepared 
me to work on further react application developer.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _4_

**What did you enjoy about Complete Me?** 

I enjoyed the fact that I was able to implement Complete Me into Weathrly. I also liked that it just nested objects.

**What was challenging?** 

It was hard to visualize Complete Me and you are only able to break down the problem with whiteboarding. 

**How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime?**

Sorting Suite for me was a really challenging experience. I was not able to work with anyone initially due to a 
github error. After finally getting working suite. I was very aggressive on the final day before Sorting Suite was due.
I finally was able to work with other students and whiteboard the sorting algorithms. This lead to me understanding
the breakdown of recursive functions and increased my understanding of the call stack.

**for Weathrly?** 

Initially, my understanding of react was non existent and it was hard to understand the concepts of data flowing down,
state and components. It took making a couple components to start understand the flow of the data.  

**How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?**

I do feel as I progress through Turing I really do feel an sense of achievement when I learn and apply new skills
in a new project. 

**How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?**

I came to Turing to become job ready and by finally getting to get React develop and TDD I am know that I am
finally starting to build marketable skills.

## B: Group Work & Projects

**Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning.** 

Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? 
What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?

I feel like I learned the most from Weathrly since it was an react application and was fundamentally different from
a jQuery focused project and it is in more demand.

Projects however are really good at cementing fundamentals in my mind. While making them they force you
apply the new concepts consistently. 
 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Megan_
* **Game:** _Connect Four_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3+_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _2_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

**What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging?**
I really like that I was able to make a game and visualize the problems that we were working with. 
The most challenging was having to conceptualize the how the game would operate. In the previous projects
they were more focused on web form applications.

**What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?**
GameTime was a nice project with object oriented programming.

**How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?**
Gametime helps you understand object oriented programming.


### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _David_
* **Spec Adherence:** _4_
* **User Interface:** _4_
* **HTML Style:** _4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _4_
* **JS/React Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _2_
* **Workflow:** _3_
* **Code Sanitation:** _4_

**What did you enjoy about Weathrly?**

I enjoyed that I have a fully functioning application based on react and an actual API.
 
**What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)?**

Being able to learn how an a new javascript library works was difficult at the beginning.
However, learning react was a primary goal of mine since before joining Turing and I am really glad I finally got
the chance to not only use an API but also use a extremely popular javascript library.

**How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?**

One thing I knew before coming to Turing was that truely transferable skills is development. By finally reaching
a modern javascript it allowed my learn new tools that are valid for front-end developers.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
* _**Feedback 2**_ - 
* _**Storytelling II**_ - 
* _**Feedback III**_ - 
* _**Outreach & Networking**_ - 

**What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising?** 

The professional development sessions this mod were great. The one things that I really found surprising how 
Turing teaches how to do network as well as coding. I also really like how Turing helps teach you how to craft
your story. During the break I am going to systematically look expand my online presence through social media and in 
person events. I definitely feel that I have more tools and more confident networking in Denver.


**What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?**

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy & Privilege_
  * _Group Think_
  * _Empathy & Privilege_

 **What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising?**
 
 One on the things I found the most surprising was how hard it is to avoid Groupthink. 
 
 **Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions?**
 
 I find the sessions with gearups are good to not only take a break from constantly coding but the have
 a different perspective on life and the workplace. 
 
 **Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future?** 
 **in your workplace? with your teammates?**
 
I do feel that they help my have these conversation in the future.
 
 
## Community Participation

_**Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing?
 in Denver?** 
 
It in kinda funny how I feel about Turing now that I am in Mod2 vs Mod 1. I kinda reached a phase where I am much more
comfortable. I paired with numerous Mod1 students and I really do feel that they felt comfortable talking to me.
 
**Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable?** 
 
Yes, I paired with several Mod1 students and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, including a couple
emergency pairings. I like to see how people are stuck and helping them when they really need it. 
 

## Final Assessment

What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week?

Over the break I plan on creating a Mod1 project with react. I am also taking to another student about personal 
a react application. I feel that since I worked with one API in an application. The world APIs are available to me now.
I also want to start using prop-types in react development and attempt to self teach my self Redux during the break. 

**What are you looking forward to about next inning?**

I am simply looking forward to making applications. 

**What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?**

I will workout daily and I actually have to fly back to Kansas City to move out of my apartment in preparation of
moving to Denver for a job search later on.
