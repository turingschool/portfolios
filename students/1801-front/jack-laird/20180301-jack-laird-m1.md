# Jack Laird - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 1 I set out to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as git and gitHub. I also wanted to focus on building relationships through pairing and helping classmates

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work and projects consisted of Number Guesser, the first project of the mod that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and three static comp projects. The static comp projects are each comp recreations that require you to follow a certain format but give you liberties on parts of the design. They're intended to keep you working on your HTML and CSS abilities while allowing you to use a little JavaScript. Each comp grows in complexity and pushes you to extend your knowledge in both CSS and HTML. Learning these skills is crucial to being a developer because often times you are asked to recreate a design down to the pixel.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects consisted of LinkedList, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox. Each project built upon the JavaScript skills learned in the previous project as well as challenged you to work with a new partner each time. The paired projects also expanded upon HTML and CSS skills but the main focus of these projects is on refining JavaScript or JQuery skills and using GitHub for collaboration. The final project 2DoBox required you to add new features to IdeaBox using another persons code base. Using someone elses code teaches you to think about problems in a different way and how add new features to a site without scrapping the code base. 

#### LinkedList

The user should be able to enter a title and url that creates a card with this information.

##### Partner Feedback
“I thought we worked very well together. I like how when we worked together things never got stressful, unlike some past of my past projects. There was defiantly times we lost focus on the project and socialized so we both need to work on that. You defiantly taught me about the small but really cool focus(). Favicons forever!”

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

##### Partner Feedback
"Loved working with you, Jack! I appreciated your honesty and that you called me out on ways I could improve. Specifically, you reminded me to think and talk through the problem out loud so we could solve it together. I also appreciated your reminder to try not to look at our previous projects when we encountered similar problems.

I think our personalities enabled us to work well together. You joked around often, which didn't bother me at all, but you may have to scale that down with future partners who may be stressed out about the project or with more serious personalities.  

Thanks for being a great partner!"

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

In this Gear Up I learned that coping with stress is an individual skill, there's not one concrete stress managment strategy. From this session I developed the skills necessary to keep my head on straight when facing obstacles. I try to take meaningful breaks where I do something relaxing or fun, usually not code related, to give my brain a break. Sometimes I find that when I've worked on a project for too long I start making simple mistakes and start to get worried about my performance. I need to remain consious on taking breaks for myself.

#### Working Styles

In this session I learned about my working style and how it differs from others. This lesson was really helpful when it came to working in a group setting. It's crucial to understand that people's working styles differ a lot and it's important to find a medium that suits everyone's needs. As an extremely extroverted person, I constantly have to remind myself that some people need their space when working through a problem rather than talking through it all the time. 

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

This was a gear up that I was really able to relate to. When you're learning it feels like the knowledge you're trying to acquire feels really far away but it's important to recognize your accomplishments along the way as well. For example, the last part of the prework to Mod 1 is to build your own website. Looking back at that now, I can see how much progress I've made. Alternatively, the level of knowledge of the mods above me demonstrates how far I have to go. The Turing philosophy "I don't know that... yet" really exemplifies this process. Although the knowledge I so desperatly want to obtain is far away, it's simpy a matter of not knowing it... yet.

#### Learning Through Teaching

I really enjoyed the student-led gear up, I know that everyone at Turing is really busy so the fact that they took the time to create such an awesome gear up really meant a lot. Teaching others is something I really take pride in and enjoy. In this session I learned the keys to being a good teacher as well as being a good student. I now know how important it is to be kind, prepared, and enthusiastic when it comes to both sides! 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I fell in love with the Turing community almost instantly when I started Mod 1. The Turing culture embraces treating others with kindness and respect and emphasized inclusivity. I didn't get to holdx a leadership role as a new student outside of my class. I really enjoyed helping people with their problems and always offered to do slack calls if anyone needed help. The process of teaching someone else allows me to develop my understanding as well as learn new things in the process.
