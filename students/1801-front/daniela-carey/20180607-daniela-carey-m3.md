# Daniela Carey - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My goals for this mod were to solidify my understanding of React fundamentals, Redux, and testing - especially testing async JavaScript. I feel that I accomplished this goal and feel very comfortable with testing specifically.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
This mod I enjoyed alternating between group and individual projects and really felt the pros and cons of both styles. I enjoyed that in individual projects, I could move at a faster pace and spend less time on logistics and scheduling. However, I also felt that I could have benefitted from another set of eyes on my code to prevent some of the small mistakes. 

### SWAPI Box
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danielafcarey/swapibox)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI Box uses the Star Wars API to display information about the people, planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars franchise. A user can add/remove favorites and view them in the favorites tab. I was able to complete all iterations and implemented one extension to persist favorites in local storage.

Spotifive is an app that helps you quickly add new music to try to a Spotifive playlist in your Spotify account. Search for an artist you want to try, click Try It, and that artist's top 5 songs will be added to a Spotifive playlist in your Spotify account. Implemented with ReactJS, Redux, React Router, Redux-Saga, Spotify API, and my very own Autocomplete module (built in Mod 2 - THANKS LETA, JHUN, & BRITTANY!)

## C: Group Work & Projects
I had a great experience in both group projects this mod - both groups had a great working dynamic and I learned a lot from my partners. A huge win in Movie Tracker was our group doing TDD for the entire project. This helped solidify testing concepts for all team members and was a rewarding challenge. 

### Headcount 2.0

### Gear Up
[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)
I loved that this session provided a space to discuss microagressions that we all hear often and sometimes don't even realize are microaggressions. The challenge I took away from this session was to call out microaggressions when I hear them and to be humble enough to recognize that I am capable of them as well. 

[Code Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)
The movie we watched in this session was thought-provoking and interesting. This session made me excited to be a woman entering as a minority in the software development world. Being in the minority of software developers, I want to bring new perspective to the teams I join and help make the tech world a safe space for all groups and not as daunting for under-represented groups to enter. 

[Winning Through Failure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/winning_through_failure.md)
I was fascinated in this session to hear about all the famous people who had major failures in their lives and even in the fields that they ended up being famous in. It was a helpful time to reflect on my own failures as a software developer and prep for when that question will come up in an interview. 

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation
This session, I contributed to the community via Iron FE and pairing with Mod 2 students. These activities help solidify my own understanding of programming concepts and I love the community it promotes between mods. I hope to continue leading Iron FE and pairing with my own classmates and the mods below me.
