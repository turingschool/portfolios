# Daniela Carey - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My goal this inning was to refine my problem solving process and improve my communication during that process. I focused on gaining a strong understanding of programming vocab and concepts so that I could more clearly communicate about code to my partners, instructors, and eventually to an interviewer. In both group projects and the algorithm and data structures projects, I had to practice and refine these skills. I have definitely improved since the beginning of this inning and see how much more effective I can be as a partner and programmer when I can clearly communicate about the code I'm working on or problem I'm solving.

## A: Individual Work & Projects
The individual projects this inning helped refine my problem solving process because they were so difficult. Going into Sorting Suite and Complete Me felt daunting, but I learned the value of breaking problems like these down into smaller sections so that they were easier to think through. 

The most challenging moment during these projects was when I had spent all day writing merge sort and when I finally solved it (got it to sort an unsorted array), and then realized it was still not correct because it was so inefficient. I learned the value of TDD because my tests indicated this to me immediately. I eventually had to scrap my code and start from the beginning, which was a good exercise for me to have to think through the problem again and pivot how I was solving it. 

Next inning, I plan to continue to refine this process and want to continue to challenge myself to practice problems that may show up on a technical interview in my "free time". 

### Study Habits
This inning was less structured so I had to make sure I was managing my time well to balance working on projects, practicing objects and array prototypes, and studying concepts we learned in class. I'm pretty organized so I didn't find this to be too challenging and definitely feel that this helped me not feel overwhelmed. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I loved Sorting Suite because I love logic puzzles and implementing each sort felt like solving a logic puzzle. I enjoyed the balance on this project between working alone and working with classmates. Because I had finished the sorts earlier in the week, I was able to help talk through and problem solve the sorts with classmates. This helped reinforce my understanding of each sort and helped me refine my problem-solving process because I was going through each sort multiple times with classmates.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3.5
* **Testing:** 4
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

Similar to Sorting Suite, I really enjoyed Complete Me because it felt like another logic puzzle to solve. I was able to do TDD with this project, which helped me break down the problem into smaller sections as I was implementing each method. Again, I enjoyed the individual work on this project but also enjoyed problem solving with my classmates. Complete Me further refined my problem-solving process which will help me as I move to the next mods and in my interviews after Turing.

## B: Group Work & Projects

The biggest challenge of both GameTime and Weathrly was that we had just been introduced to the concepts we had to use in each of these projects. ES6, Canvas, and TDD were brand new in GameTime and React was brand new in Weathrly. However, doing a project helped us learn these new concepts quickly and reinforce the in-class lessons. Because we didn't know everything we needed when we started the project, we had to be organized and break the problem down into smaller parts so we could work with what we did know until we had a chance to learn and be taught what we didn't yet know. 

For both of these projects, I used Asana for project management and plan to continue to use this in my future projects to stay organized and keep the team on track. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Eric Jungbluth
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3.5
* **Workflow:** 3.5

GameTime helped reinforce ES6 concepts we had just been introduced to. One challenging part was that I wanted to do TDD but we didn't learn how to do it until halfway through the project. Instead, Eric and I decided to pseudocode tests as much as possible to help drive the development of our game. The biggest challenge was the collision detection, which we had to break down and whiteboard in order to wrap our minds around how to code it. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Tony Robertson
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 3.5
* **HTML Style:** 4
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 4
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

The best part about Weathrly was that it helped me learn ReactJS quickly. The biggest challenge was definitely testing React, but after the project I feel that I have a much better understanding of how to approach testing and hope to build on this in Mod 3.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * [Agile](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_and_leadership.md)
  * [Feedback II](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)
  * [Storytelling II](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/professional_storytelling_ii.md)
  * [Feedback III](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_iii.md)
  * [Outreach & Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_and_networking.md)

I felt that the Storytelling and Outreach sessions were very valuable because I like to plan. The Storytelling session helped me intetionally think about how I wanted to tell my story as I'm networking and the Outreach session helped me develop a timeline for reaching out to my contacts. I appreciated these sessions keeping me accountable to staying on track with my future job search. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * [Empathy & Privilege](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown)
  * [Group Think](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)
  * [Your Cell Phone is a Civil Rights Issue]()

I felt that the Empathy and Privilege was one of the most valuable Gear Up sessions I've had so far at Turing. This helped our cohort have more empathy for each other which I think helped us work better together during this mod. These discussions and the ones in the Group Think session are important to keep in mind as I move into a new job and 

-----------------------

## Community Participation

Going into this mod, I was looking forward to the opportunity to be more active in the community through pairing with Mod 1 students and collaborating with my classmates. I was definitely more active this mod than in Mod 1 by pairing often and collaborating more with my own classmates during Sorting Suite and Complete Me. This 1) helped solidify my own understanding of these concepts and 2) helped me get to know other Turing students and grow my Turing network. Additionally, I found a Turing alum to be my mentor and met via Zoom with other Turing alum to discuss life after Turing. 

## Final Assessment

Next inning, I'm looking forward to getting a better grasp on ReactJS. I hope that next inning gives me similar opportunities to practice my problem solving and logic skills like with Complete Me and Sorting Suite. During intermission week, I plan to:
* take a break from coding to refresh
* complete the Mod 3 prework
* practice using vim
* work on Leet Code problems to practice for technical interviews
