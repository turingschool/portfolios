## Areas of Emphasis

What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?
  My learning focus this inning was to really understand how to manipulate objects. The technical skills that I wanted to grow were to be able to approach a problem that seems out of my skill set and break it down into digestable pieces so that I can solve it, or at least begin to. My communication skills that I wanted to work on this mod were to ask for help when I needed to instead of just struggling and going into a tailspin of self-doubt and despair.
  
  I feel like I have definitely achieved these goals. I have also learned how to work with difficult people this mod, which was really character building.

* B: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* C: Professional Skills**: 4
* D: Community Participation**: 2
* E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?
  * My individual work this mod ended up being the most beneficial. I spent a lot of time this mod practicing array prototyes and object manipulation, which was realy helpful in preparing for the final assessment. 
  * The Weathrly project was the most beneficial project for me because I did it alone and it really helped me to further understand React.
  * The most challenging project this inning was when we were expected to build a prefix trie. 
  * For next inning I plan to continue spending a little time every day working on skills that need to be strengthened. I plan to help run ironFE and that will really make sure that I get the skills.
  * I plan to change my schedule a little bit so that I can wake up earlier and go on a run every day. It really helps with my stress management.

### Study Habits

What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?
  * MY study habits for this inning were multiplied. I was constantly working, constantly studying. They did serve me well.


### Sorting Suite
* Outcome: Pass

What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?
  * I enjoyed that I understood what the code was doing this time around instead of just memorizing it. Also, helping other students understand it was really nice. Sorting suite helped work on my goal to take a complex problem and break it up into smaller parts. It was different than the other projects for me because I ended up working mostly on my own for sorting suite. It serves my overall goals for turing by challening myself.

### Complete Me =Radix Trie
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 2
* **Testing:** 4
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4 
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 4 

What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

Hoestly. This project was the lowest that I have ever been at my entire time at Turing. Which is saying a great deal as a double repeater. I did not enjoy a single minute of it and lost the love of coding that I was starting to build up. It did not serve my overall goal. I understand that working with a difficult problem is important but there comes to a point where you're asking someone who is already feeling really low to do something that no-one else has ever done. There wasn't a single good outlet to get guidance, and there wasn't even anything online that could have been used to help.

## B: Group Work & Projects
_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Stephanie Ospina
* **Game:** Break-out
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 2
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?
* Game time was really fun in general! I had an excellent partner and really understood how classes and components work with eachother.

### Weathrly
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 4
* **HTML Style:** 4
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 4
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3 

What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?
I really enjoyed this project! I did it by myself and that was really awesome because last time around I wasn't super comfortable with React, and this time around it clicked :)

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile reflections
  * Professional story
  * Outreach
  * Feeback II

What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy and Privilege
  * Group think
  * M4 choice session: Value of Introverts

What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?

  I think that the most valuable things about the gear up sessions this mod were being able to hear other people's opinions and experiences. In the empathy and privilege session it was really eye-opening to hear other people's struggles and the ways that lacking privilege can come in so many different forms. 
  
  I think that it is really important to have these conversations because these issues will otherwise just be brushed away and never dealt with. 
  
  I do feel like I have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future. These are the types of issues that I want to bring awareness to in the world and I think that the more you talk about it, the more likely the issues will be resolved.

## Community Participation

Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?

I participated in my community a great deal this mod. Not only in my own mod by meeting for IronFE like session on Thursday and Friday mornings, but also by pairing with mod 1 students to help them with their projects. Since I was repeating this inning, a great deal of my classmates came to me for help and guidance and that was really great at honing in my skills. 

## Final Assessment

What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?

Over intermission week I am meeting with a psychiatrist to talk about solutions to help deal with my anxiety that causes me to freeze up and makes me unable to think logically enough to solve problems that I have been practicing and breezing through all mod.
