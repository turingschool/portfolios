### Areas of Emphasis

Before Turing I had some experience with Javascript, HTML and CSS. I was more comfortable with HTML and Javascript than CSS, so my plan was to was to become more confident in my CSS. That being said, I was not proficient with JS or HTML. I had some knowledge, but my plan of attack for those languages was to sharpen my skills and gain confidence in my code.

### A: End of Module Assessment



### B: Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed starting off with the individual projects. I thought that a little bit of individual work was a great way to warm up to the languages we were learning and helped us figure out how we as individuals like to code, research and seek help. Number Guess was a great reintroduction to JavaScript.

#### Number Guesser

+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]

Number Guesser is game in which the user can guess a number between 0 and 100. The user is given feedback after every guess to let them know if their guess is too high or low, or if their guess is correct. At any time the user can change the range to whatever they want, as long as it is a valid range.

**Evaluator**: Pamela Lovett

**Notes/What To Work On**:
All the way through phase 2 - parts of phase 3

Nice job using a checklist for organization

Design is pretty spot on - some polishing needed

Be sure to organize your CSS rules

Organize your declarations alphabetically or idiomatically

Remove commented out code that isn't working

Good start for JS - some opportunities for refactoring longer functions

**Functional Expectations**:
Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

### Static Comp 1
+ [https://github.com/meloncatty/kh-comp-challenge-1]
+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html]

My approach with this project was to create a layout for an app that promotes anything to do with music, from listening to creating, from learning to teaching, and from instruments to tech. The design mimicked a layout for a phone application. I decided to use flexbox for this project, and I struggled with figuring it out at first. But, at the last minute, the answers to my issues sort of clicked and I understood why I was having issues. I felt proud for overcoming these issues because I have always had a hard time with CSS.

Feedback I received was that there was too much whitespace in the welcome section of my comp. Text was not centered under icons. No squirrely-ness with squishing the browser page. Breakpoints were okay and flow was consistent.

### Static Comp 2
+ [https://github.com/meloncatty/kh-comp-challenge-2]
+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html]

It was fun putting a more personal spin on this comp. I also enjoyed seeing everyone else's creations and learning how they approached things. The design for this project was a basic webpage with a navigation header and the body displayed cards with descriptions of the website's users. I chose flexbox for this project because at times it can be a powerful tool and because I had become more comfortable with it. However, while building this layout I discovered that the amount of items being flexed can grow exponentially, and this can lead to a lot of frustration.

Feedback I received was that my main font and overall font sizes on the page were good. The font for the banner's header clashed with the main font-family. Content spacing appears okay on fullscreen. My media queries only accounted for the cards and not the banner. Quotes should not be centered in their containers. Overall spacing of card content was okay but there was too much whitespace at the bottom.

### Static Comp 3

.. [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html]

This project was just as rewarding as it was upsetting. Thinking back, I think what tripped me up was my initial approach to the project. I stopped thinking of the content on the page as collections of one or more of the same thing and instead thought of them as giant, convoluted DIVS. Even though I was flexbox once again, I felt like I was learning flexbox all over again. The more my website grew, the more I had to go back to tweak things or figure out what was causing element placement issues. Overall I was glad with how my project compared to the desktop view challenge comp.

Feedback I received was that my copy button next to the input looked good. Some issue with extra whitespace in the job description header. The navigation bar's content was vertically aligned with each other well. The content on the right side of the page with text-copy inputs were well spaced vertically. Informed about bem naming conventions for html classes. When using divs, it is best to use semantic tags within them to avoid ambiguity. Clean on the fly with HTML/CSS files.

## C: Group Work & projects

### Projects

Our first pair project was Linked List, which consisted of displaying an infinite amount of user input on the page. Our second pair project was IdeaBox, which involved using local storage to essentially do what Linked List did but user data was stored locally and accessible later. Our final pair project required us to refactor someone else's IdeaBox code and implement or clean up existing functionality.

#### Linked-Lists

+ [https://github.com/meloncatty/linked-list]
+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]

This application gave the user the ability to submit a website url and title and have it appear on the page. My partner and I chose to use jQuery for this project. This was my first pair project and I learned a lot about good pair workflow.

#### Notes/What To Work On:
Sounds like it was a great learning experience on both sides
Learned a lot about pairing
Git workflow and learning suffered due to pairing

##### comp
Some issues with responsiveness
Leverage containers more

##### html
Some issues with nesting
Keep accessibility in mind

##### css
Consider organizing based on components on the page
set base font weight for the page and override where necessary
Consider adding organizational comments
break out duplicate lines into more broad selectors (ie. card-button class)

##### js
Break template literals onto multiple lines and format like you would in html file
no need for $.on load when script is at bottom of body
never nest event listeners
naming conventions could use work (think in terms of actions)

##### git and github
Would like to see more commits and commits more often
50 commits would be good for a project of this magnitude

### IdeaBox

+ [https://github.com/meloncatty/ideabox2]
+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]

IdeaBox was almost the same as Linked-Lists, except we stored user input in local storage. This allowed the user input to persist if they close the browser and return to the website. I enjoyed taking a dive into JSON with this one.

#### General
Hooray for body text not falling out of container when there are large amounts of text!
Update CSS to make save button appear disabled
Buggy - search sort of works, new line character showing up in local storage, persistUserData causing problems

#### Design/Comp recreation
Responsive, clean, very aligned to the comp
Buttons turning to squares on mobile view in dev tools

#### Git/GitHub
Yay for merge conflicts! (Austin had first merge conflict). Glad you were able to walk through it
More commits - would like to see more than 13 commits
Be more descriptive in commits

#### HTML
Used screenreader!!!
Good job using aria-labels, semantic elements
Styling containers that should not be needed to reproduce the comp. Target elements when you are able

#### CSS
Nice job with organizing rules in CSS - easy to follow
Two media queries - good job, less is often more!
Don't remove outline on interactive elements (line 25) without other styling in place for accessibility/keyboard users
Avoid absolute positioning (line 96) - consider placing this part of the layout in its own container instead
Organize your declarations idiomatically

#### JS
Nice work using named functions for event listeners
Unclear why constructor is pulling value from input (18/19) when params are in place
Parts of createIdea are hard to follow. Unclear why a new instance is being created with no args, params being set for createIdea that aren't used, getFromStorage being called in 60
Work on naming
Good job splitting a lot of the functionality apart

### Functional Expectations

+ Advanced Beginner Application
Allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
+ Proficient
The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

#### HTML

+ Accessibility
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

+ Exceptional
Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

#### Style

+ Proficient Crafts
Clean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

#### CSS

+ Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation
Proficient, develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#### JAVASCRIPT

+ Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

+ Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

+ Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

+ Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

+ Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Objects & Prototypes
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

+ DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

+ Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### GIT & GITHUB

+ Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

+ GitHub
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN

+ Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING

+ Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

### ToDoBox

+ [https://github.com/meloncatty/2DoBox-Pivot]
+ [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html]

For this project we were given someone else's IdeaBox and we had to refactor their code. We gave the application new features and changed the user experience. Not only was it interesting to work through someone else's code, it was fun making their code and your code work together.

## D: Professional skills

During our Gear Up sessions we learned about overcoming the fear of learning difficult things, individual working styles, managing stress and coping mechanisms, and how personal stories help us connect.

### Gear Up

#### Working Styles

It was surprising how much I had in common with others who identified as mostly introverted. I had always thought that I was the only person who felt differently about social interactions. Being honest with myself and others about this during this session helped me to be honest with my partners about my work habits. This led to better pairing experiences.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

I enjoyed discovering how learning and difficult tasks can drain all of your cognitive resources. Kathy Sierra's concept of learning turns learning into a positive experience rather than a never-ending struggle. I particularly liked these suggestions:
+ Split your learning material into smaller subskills and learning in pieces
+ Have short sessions of 45-90 minutes on each task, if you cannot progress then minify those tasks
+ Revisit skills you've mastered
+ Learn with high quality and high quantity examples

#### Personal Stories & Connection

Stories are how we connect with ourselves and others. It is important to always be telling stories and listening to them. The exchange between the listener and speaker is symbolic and we recognize this at a very young age. While we may enjoy immersing ourselves into novels of fiction or comic books, the consumption of stories proclaimed by our neighbors is a healthy part of your story diet. By listening in on others' stories, we can, in a sense, immerse ourselves into their world and ultimately connect with local communities in more meaningful ways.

#### Managing Stress & Coping mechanisms

I always feels this pressure in the back of my mind to be working, and I get stressed out when I'm not working or studying. I can also become stressed out from working long hours. Through all of the stress I try to keep a constant positive mental attitude about my personal progress as well as my future. Over time this makes me worry less about smaller problems and I tackle the larger issues at hand.

## E: Community Participation

The few times I paired I really enjoyed my experience. Each person either had a unique suggestion to implement into the code or advice on how to properly use certain developer tools. I enjoyed going to the Learning Through Teaching session held by some of the students in Mod 4. It was nice of them to dedicate time to us like that during one of the busiest weeks at Turing. My favorite community event is the weekly lightning talks. It's nice to see people's personalities and passion for coding shine through in their presentations. While I don't always reach out, I value all of the knowledge and inspiration that the Turing community has to offer.
