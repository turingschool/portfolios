## Areas of Emphasis

I enjoyed working with React last mod so my main areas of focus were with testing and Redux.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass. While I struggled with testing I did not give up in learning how to become better at testing. With my personal project
I believe I improved my testing skills, saw the benefit of TDD at some points (like when I wrote test afterwards I noticed
that some of the code I had written was not necessary) and I learned to enjoy testing even more.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meloncatty/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project required us to use a Star Wars API to pull in data and display it to the user. Users would be able to navigate around and view different types of information and were also able to favorite their favorite types of information. This project gave us a change to have fun with an API, focus on the patterns in React and try out TDD.

#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meloncatty/personal-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

SOS - Search Open Source is an application that allows users to search for open source research articles. If the user has an account and is signed in, they are able to archive articles. When user navigates to their dashboard, their saved articles are populated for them to view.  
I chose this API because open source is important to me, and as a developer I would like to be able to contribute to open source in my spare time. Initially I thought it might be too easy to just display articles on a page, but that was not the case. The project was challenging enough, and implementing a backend contributed to the challenge. I used thunks to encapsulate my API requests, which would make testing easier. I am very proud of the improvement I made with testing on this project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meloncatty/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount 2.0 was a light introduction to using an API, though we were only working with a mock data set. The application displayed district data related to schools. When user clicked on two district cards they were displayed at the top of the page and showed the user the averages of the two. User could filter by district name. I enjoyed this group project as we were very flexible with our work styles and had fun with it. The project was built with create-react-app. We were able to implement one extension. Together we learned about how to implement proptypes and how to test our functionality.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meloncatty/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This application allowed users to see recent movies and information about those movies. If users were signed in they were able to save their choice of movies. The application used Postgres for the backend. It was a challenge to implement Redux on top of working with a real backend for the first time, but we learned a lot.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

Microagressions can be easy to brush off if they are not directed at you, or if you do not always know if they have occurred. It is up to us to be open to discussion about these things and work with one another in order to create a positive environment for everyone.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

This gear up made me realize that as a white woman I might also be more privileged than other women in the field. Before the viewing I liked that we were encouraged to think outside of the box and think of those who may not identify themselves as male or female, as the documentary was slightly old. Afterwards I enjoyed talking to others about the issues described in the documentary, particularly how we have been affected by these issues, when we first realized they were issues and how we as future leaders of the tech world can help fight these issues.

#### Using Public Data

I thoroughly enjoyed this gear up, and I always appreciate the mod 4 people who generously donate their time to talk with us. Our discussions during this gear up were very insightful and I enjoyed talking about things that are of personal importance to me, such as helping out local communities based on community work. They provided us with some great resources for looking into public data, and I appreciated that very much.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

While I found it difficult to pair with others during this mod, I tried to make an effort to socialize with other members of Turing. Even though I was not able to help out much by way of teaching, I tried to offer moral support and engaged in communication in order to strengthen my relationships at Turing. At times I was able to assist other Mod 3 classmates with issues if they came to me with questions.

## Final Review

### Notes

- personal project: open source science search
- make sure to polish pitch on personal project
- make sure in mod 4 to mentor/pair with people from 3. Figure who is most receptive to your teaching

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 2.5
