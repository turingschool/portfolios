## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### SWAPI-Box

* [SWAPI-Box](https://github.com/seamus-quinn/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

Microaggressions are something that I think are very important for everyone to know about.  I had already learned about this in a different context so it was refreshing to learn the same thing with a new context (the world of tech).  I had a great conversation and learned some new things about myself and my teammates.

[Code Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

We watched a movie for this and had a deep conversation surrounding the barriers that come with being anything other than a straight white male.  I think that balancing the gender gap is important, as well as bringing a multiplicity of identities into the world of programming.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I organized the Students vs. Staff SAB Basketball event, which proved to be wildly successfull.  I also helped with other SAB events as well.  I made a point to help my fellow Mod 2 students with some of their projects as well.
