## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

> My biggest achievement of this module was learning that the back-end is not something I should be afraid of.  Coming into this mod I thought the back-end was a completely different world of programming.  Now I understand that it is just another framework using the skills I have already learned from the front-end.  While I still want to focus on the front-end, it is comforting to know that I am capable to building every aspect of a web-app

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

> The thing I struggle with the most is interviewing.  I find vague questions such as "Tell me about a time you failed" very hard to answer because I haven't taken the time yet to think about a meaningful answer.  Since there are so many possible answers, I have trouble coming up with an answer on the spot, and end up freezing.  I haven't had enough time to think about these questions during this mod.  One of my main priorities will be to write answers to all the common interview questions and practice giving the them until it is second nature.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

> Not specific to this mod, but throughout Turing I have noticed that I care about details much more so than my many of my peers.  Whenever something isn’t optimal, it bothers me.  Even if a button is off alignment by a pixel, I won’t be satisfied until it’s right.  Even with variable and function names, I’ve noticed I put more thought into it than most, and try my best to pick the most descriptive name.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

> While I found it very worthwhile to learn the basics of back-end development, this mod has reinforced what I already felt.  I would rather be a master of some technologies than a jack of all trades.  And I don’t feel I am even close of mastering the fundamentals of the front-end.  Viewing all the amazing examples on https://codepen.io/ inspires me to become an expert so that someday I can create front-end experiences on a similarly high level.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

> The most important skills I have learned from Turing is patience and confidence.  I remember in mod 1 I would get frustrated when I couldn’t figure out how to do something in a timely manner.  I had a lot of uncertainty about my future.  One of the the great things about Turing is that it tests what you are capable of.  Now when I encounter a hard problem, I have the tools to overcome it.  I now know that I have the ability to become a skilled web developer.
