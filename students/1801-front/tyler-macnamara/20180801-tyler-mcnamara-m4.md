## 30-Day Job Search Action Plan
### Create a schedule & goals for the first 30 days Post-Graduation
Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for:
* Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)
* Outreach & Networking
* Job & company research and tracking
* Interview Prep
* Housekeeping (refining your professional story, updating your resume, writing cover letters, updating your Turing portfolio, updating your LinkedIn profile)
* Other (social networking, blogging, planning talks, etc.)
* Check-ins: who are you talking to and when?

How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?

**Action Step #1:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.

```

Created a Google Calendar (link below) with a plan for each day.

```

[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1pu4ppd82uo502e3481ju0g4u8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FDenver)

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?

```
I plan on ending the job search once I get a job however I would like to find a job within 2 months max, 
hopefully within the first month out of Turing. I am going to push hard each day to land a position ASAP. 

```

**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:

```

#### Daily

* Code challenges and soft interview question practice
* Work on refactoring projects and build on my capstone for a few hours
* Job search and outreach for a couple hours

#### Weekly

* Apply to 5 jobs
* Reach out to 5 people
* Attend 1 meetup

#### Monthly

* Apply to * daily goals times 4

```

### Coding
For time spent coding during your first 30 days post-grad, consider:
* What skills would you like to improve or develop?

```

I would like to polish all the topics that we touched on while at Turing, from Mod 1 on. I feel like I 
have good grasp on most of what we were taught during my time here but it's easy to forget past topics 
as you learn knew ones. 

```

* Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?

```

I really want to work on my GitHub skills. This is the one area I feel pretty weak in. 

```

* Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

```

I would love to look into Angular, Python, and Ruby, just to get a basic understanding of the languages 
and how they work. I don't plan on spending too much time actually learning these languages during the 
job seach however. 

```

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’ll put small daily exercises or work on issues from your own projects that you want to update to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active. For your Mod 4 portfolio review, be prepared to describe to your instructors what you plan to work on to sharpen and advance your coding skills for the first 30 days of your job search.

```

Created one on GitHub starting the Monday after graduation. 

```

### Outreach & Networking
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking to stay on track during your first 30 days.

**Action Step #1:** Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about, when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.

```

*** 1st Individual: Ryan Brongers, MMC Agency

He is someone that I know that lives in LA and started an app company with his friend that has done 
really well. I would love to work for a company that is continuously building apps and for one that 
allows me to design as well as code, this company I could do both. 

I have emailed him already but haven't talked too much about the posibility of working at the company. 
I was planning on doing that within the next week. 

I plan on letting him know that I would love for the opportunity to work at a company like his and let 
him know that I have developed some strong coding skills to compliment my past experience in web design 
and online marketing.


*** 2nd Individual: Nick Kishfy, MojoTech

He is the president of an app company in Boulder that works primarily in React and Redux. It is a 
small company but one that seems reputable and one that is good to work for. I would also love to work 
in React if I get the chance. 

I plan on emailing him this weekend explaining that I saw an open position in the company and that I 
would love to chat when he has the opportunity as well as forward over my resume and portfolio. 

I plan on following up by saying thank you for making the time to have a conversation with me and that 
I am very interested in the position at MojoTech and would appreciate the opportunity to interview.


*** 3rd Individual: Courtney Haynes

She is the director of Partnerships and Development at Turing. She suggested a position in Charlotte 
thatlooks interesting at Hendrick Auto. I am willing to relocate for the right position so up for taking 
a look at this position at a company that would like to hire Turing students. 

I plan on talking to her tomorrow and will hopefully get an introduction to the hiring person at the 
company. 

Once I talk to Hendrick Auto I plan on following up the same way I will with MojoTech. Thanks for the 
opportunity to chat and that I would love to continue the conversation, as well as mention my willingness 
to relocate if the position was right. 

```

**Action Step #2:** Find 3 new meetups or other career networking events to join during your first 30 days post-grad and describe why you'll attend those particular events. How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? If you're interested in speaking at any of these meetups, describe how you'll connect with the organizers to arrange that and give a brief (2-3 sentences) pitch on what you might talk about and why.

```

*** Code for Denver Project Night - Monday, August 13

This meetup seems like a great opportunity to see what other people in the industry are working on
to both get ideas and to network with others about how and why they created the projects they did. 

This could benefit my career search by connecting me with individuals in the same field through
talking about their projects as well as discuss the projects and presentations I have took part in. 

If I were to speak at one of these I would say:

Hello, I am a recent graduate of the Front-End program at the Turing School of Software and Design.
I would love to present a project that me and my partner have been working on, first as our capstone
and now as a personal project with hopes of adding it to the Apple Store soon. The app displays
up-to-date Happy Hour times based on location, seating, distance, type of food and drink, and other 
filters. We built the server, retrieved the data personally, and built out the front-end with React
and Redux. 


*** React Monthly Meetup - Tuesday, August 21

I would love a job working in React so no better place to meet people that I can network with then 
React meetups as well as a place to expand my React skill set. I have a decent knowledge of React 
because of Turing so can hopefully contribute to some of the newcomers if they have any questions. 

If I were to speak at one of these meetups I would look up the organizer on Meetup.com and let them 
know I would like to speak and say something similar to this. 

I would love to speak at the Monthly React Meetup on Tuesday, August 21st. I am a recent Turing graduate 
who focused on React and Redux during my schooling, I would like to speak about my experience learning 
React along with Redux and how to implement the two most effectively in terms of when to use state 
and the redux store. 


*** Blockchain Meetup - Tuesday, August 28

I have talked to an investor friend of mine who told me that blockchain coding position are in high 
demand so it is something I would love to learn more about. 

I don't know much about the technology at this point so it would be more of a learning experience for
me then contribution. It would be a great place to build a network though if I end up looking more into
the industry as a possible opportunity. 



```

### Job/Company Research & Tracking
Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

**Action Step:** Show how you've set up [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io/) to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, what next steps you'll take to follow-up, and anything you might do differently next time. Be prepared to describe this system to your instructors during your portfolio review.

### Interview Prep
During this module, you've had multiple opportunities to practice your technical and cultural interviewing skills. Think about how those experiences have helped you identify strengths and weaknesses in your interviewing skills.

**Action Step:** Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills. If you plan on setting up more mock interviews, identify who you will set those up with and by what date.


```

I definitely need to improve on the technical interview aspect as I learned during my mock interview. 
I have set aside 1 - 2 hours each day to do code challenges and review past mods lessons to strengthen 
my JavaScript fundamentals and to be more prepared in this area.

I would also like to work speaking using the correct technical terms as well as focus on relaxing during 
interviews and to let my personality shine a little more by doing more mock interviews so that I feel 
comfortable in actual ones. 

I plan on doing more mock interviews, with classmates each week as well as with any instructors or Turing 
staff that have the availability. I plan on setting another one up early next week. 

```

### Housekeeping
Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:** Ensure your [Turing Portfolio](http://turing.io/alumni) has **at least 3 projects displayed,** including your latest work, and an accurate list of your desired locations. Be prepared to show this to your instructors during your M4 portfolio review.

**Action Step #2:** Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and indicates that you’re job hunting. Indicate here a summary of any adjustments you made and how you'll continue to update it and/or use the site to build your network and online presence.

```

I updated my photo, added a photo of Stephanie and I after winning the Code Fair, updated my title and 
education, as well as my description. 

```

### Other
What other areas would you like to focus on during your job search? Some possible ideas include:
* Social Networking
* Blogging
* Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks
* Participating in hackathons or open source projects

**Action Step:** Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30 days post-grad and be prepared to discuss this with your instructors at your portfolio review.

```

I plan on posting extensively on social media including LinkedIn and Twitter.

```

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?
Accountability is key during a job search and being able to check in with a person whom you trust (or, ideally, more than one person) on your progress will increase your ability to reach your goals in the timeline you've created.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. Consider how you might continue to utilize your PD Peer Groups. Describe why you will check in with this person, how you will check in with them, what you aim to talk about, and what you hope to get out of these check-ins to benefit your job search.

```

We have discussed as a cohort meeting up once a week to talk about job developments as well as work 
on code challenges and other interview prep questioning together. 

```


### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers
While you've made concrete plans for how to achieve your goal, it's also important to take stock of what could hold you back in the job search.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.

```

I plan on sticking to the plan I laid out in my google calendar which includes coding each day, 
working on code challenges, as well as networking. This will be difficult to stick to since it 
will be a majority of every day but I plan on overcoming this by not straying from the schedule 
since getting a job quickly is a top priority. 

```

## #2: Supporting Others in Your Cohort in Their Job Search
*Fill out this part only if you have already secured a job prior to graduation. This part is optional.*

As a member of the Turing community, your support in the job search makes a big difference for your peers as they pursue their first position. Complete the following action steps to

**Action Step #1:** Identify 1-2 people from your PD Peer Group who you will continue to check in with during the first 30 days post-graduation. Describe what you will do in these check-ins, how you will help keep them motivated, and how you will follow up with these cohortmates afterwards.

```

As mentioned above we plan on meeting up once a week to work on interview prep and check-in with
each other about job progress and to hold each other accountable.

```

**Action Step #2:** With the person(s) you identified above, describe one area of the job search that you feel particularly skilled in and will commit to helping them with on a regular basis during the first 30 days. Examples include: review outreach emails, review blog posts, practice storytelling, attend meetups or other events with them, etc. Why do you feel that you can help in this area? What will your help look like?

```

I am very open to going to meetups and will attend as many as possible with others in my PD group. 
I feel like I can give some good feedback about storytelling and the way people answer interview
questions so plan on stepping up in these areas. 

```

**Action Step #3:** Utilize your networking experience in the job search to recommend 1-2 people whom you've met that others in your cohort would benefit from meeting as well. Describe how you will make the introductions for at least 1 person in your cohort and when you will execute this by.

```

I met a lead engineer while driving Uber that I have met with a couple times. He works at a company 
that focuses more on the backend. Helen has mentioned in being interested in these positions so I 
was planning on connecting them two.

```

## #3: Post-Grad Plans & Action Steps
In this section, you'll find action steps that you should aim to complete during your first 30 days post-grad, but these are not steps that you need to have completed for your portfolio review. Instead, you should begin thinking about how you will achieve these steps, and your post-grad job search support coach will ask about progress on these during that first 30 days.

**Scheduling Post-Grad Action Step:** At the end of each week during your first 30 days, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search.

**Outreach Post-Grad Action Step:** During the first 30 days, you should aim to reach out to at least 10 individuals. Even if you don't have a list of all 10 for the draft of this plan for portfolio review, be prepared to meet this target during your first 30 days of the job search.

**Job/Company Research & Tracking Post-Grad Action Step:** Reach out to and apply to at least 10 companies/jobs.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #1:** During this timeframe, you should establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer. You should already have a working version that you submitted in Module 3.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #2:** Establish a “master” cover letter with your key talking points that you'll customize per employer.
