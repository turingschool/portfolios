# Tyler McNamara - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I made a commitment to myself that I was going to work as hard as possible to succeed in this program which meant making sacrifices in other aspects of my life so that I could completely focus on programming. I didn't have any previous programming experience so wasn't sure how I would do at Turing but didn't want to fail because of a lack of effort. 

This module I was hoping to get a good grasp of the basics of programming and begin to change the way I think to one of a developer. I understand that working in a team and with partners will be the norm after landing a job in the field so learning how to use Github was a priority of mine as well. Learning how to correctly implement HTML, CSS, and JS in combination was another area of emphasis for me.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel that I passed this module based on my strong project evals throughout the module as well as solid performance in the final assessments. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I truly did enjoy working on the projects throughout the mod. What I enjoyed the most was taking what I learned in class and implementing this knowledge into actual projects. I am able concentrate more effectively when I work alone which I enjoyed about the individual projects although the partner projects were very beneficial when running into issues that were difficult to resolve alone. 

#### Number Guesser

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project required us to create a game where the user must guess a number originally between 0 - 100 and then between a range selected by the user. If a letter was entered or it was outside of the range it would alert the user that they needed to select a number within the range. Once the user guessed the number correct a modal would pop up asking if they wanted to play again, if they did then the range would expand by 10 on both ends. 

I really enjoyed this project because it was the first time applying what we learned in class to an actual project with a visual result. It was difficult understanding how to get started but once I got moving I found that I was able to grasp how to complete the project without a great deal of difficulty, although looking back there were definitely things I could have done to refactor the code. Passing in parameters was also difficult for me to grasp during this project.

#### Static Comp 1

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/tm-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/tm-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For this static comp we needed to recreate a design that included a large image on the right and a bunch of smaller boxes on the left hand side. Laying out the desktop version wasn't as difficult as deciding how to layout the mobile version and actually implementing that design. I chose to take a different route with the mobile version and turned the large right side image into the background plus enlarged the box with text and a link then applied an opacity. The other boxes I made smaller and placed them below. 


#### Static Comp 2

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/tm-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/tm-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static comp two involved designing a page that had a header with a bunch of cards below. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to use grid as the cards were all the same size and spaced equally apart. Flexbox would have worked as well and would have been fairly easy to implement but I decided that this was a great excuse to use a new technique. In the end, although maybe my theme wasn't overly exciting, I think the project turned out well and I learned a lot about grid along with how to toggle an element with CSS. 


#### Static Comp 3

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/tm-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/tm-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This was by far the most difficult static comp of the mod as expected. For me it started off well but got complicated when the HTML & CSS started piling up. I decided to stick with the theme that was given to us so that I could focus on the layout and mobile design instead of the theme this time around. I was really pleased how my mobile version turned out. I had to move elements around a lot which required some duplicate HTML and the addition of classes to toggle display none and block to accomplish this. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects for me were very enjoyable experiences. Working with others isn't always the easiest but I feel I got lucky with my pairings. Most of my partners were able to work at the times I was able to and get a great hard start early so that we didn't stress as the due date approached. In the end I feel that I put my all into each project and the happy with the final results. 

#### Linked List

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/linked-list/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a project where we allowed the user to input a title and URL, in doing so it would be added to the right side of the page as a card. The user could then select read or delete to toggle their state. For this project I partnered with Daniela. We both had the same idea to get going early in the weekend so that we could complete most of the project by Monday. We both seemed to have a decent grasp on JS at that point and were able to help each other out when we ran into any issues. 

I thought the end result was very good. We completed all phases of the project and our design was accurate compared to the comp.

#### Idea Box

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box involved creating a program that allowed the user to enter in an idea title and body that in turn prepended an idea to the bottom of the page. 

My partner for this project was Cameron. Like my previous partner we got going early on it and got a large amount done the first day. We both were able to work quickly and helped each other out a lot. I was able to teach him a few things about HTML and CSS and he did a great job helping me out on a few JS issues I had a hard time understanding. We did our project a little different than others by prepending the entire list segment instead of creating objects but both decided to figure out how to create objects and store them as a side project on our own to get an understanding of how it worked for future knowledge. 

I was very pleased with the result and with the pairing.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [Github Pages](https://mcnamara14.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)
* [Github Rep](https://github.com/mcnamara14/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project asked for my partner Keeliana and I to refactor and add onto another groups IdeaBox code. This was definitely the most challenging project of the mod. Understanding someone elses code and why they did things the way the way they did was difficult but also a great learning experience. 

This was the first project where we weren't able to work in person for a majority of it which caused some issues with merge conflicts and dividing up work appropriately but in the end we were able to get nearly every step complete and again I was happy with the result.

## D: Professional Skills

The professional developments were very informative and something I'm glad that Turing offers to its students. 

The Strengths Finder exercise helped me understand what my strengths are and how to leverage them in the world of programming. It also helped me understand the areas I'm not as strong in after speaking with others during the class. I realized that I'm sometimes too easy going and need to be more focused completing my goals. This has been something I have worked on a good amount while attending Turing. 

Learning to pair was an important PD to be apart of as we were just getting into pairing for the first time. Learning how to work with someone, especially with a different personality or working style, definitely helped with the process of paired programming.

Giving feedback the correct way that is both positive while also adding coaching advice was a good thing to be reminded of. Being overly critical doesn't help anyone out and instead only causes resentment. 

I really enjoyed the storytelling PD. I have trouble on occassion telling stories but being forced to do so with others I didn't know helped break me out of my shell in this regard. Also, drawing visions of our future is something that I need to do more often and this helped to remind myself to focus on my goals and why I am at Turing. 

Linkedin, Twitter, and other social media platforms have been things that I've put on the back burner recently but the developer identity session reminded me that I shouldn't. I will most likely get a job through network and connecting with people before applying for a position. Presenting myself as a knowledgeable person in this field is extremely important and potentially how I will land a position out of school. 

### Gear Up

#### Stress management

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Stress management is obviously an extremely important topic while attending an intense bootcamp such as Turing. With going to school during the day and having projects that occupy most your free time there is not much time to unwind. This gear up taught us about different types of stress, some good, that motivates us, while a good majority is bad. What I took away from this is that I need to monitor the type of stress I'm experiencing and when I'm feeling the wrong kind of stress I need to take a break from the computer and do something I enjoy. This was difficult to do at first but I feel like I've begun to get better at understanding my feelings and taking the appropriate actions to not let the stress take over too much. 

#### Working styles introvert / extrovert / ambivert

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This was one of the most interesting gear ups I attended. I learned how introverts, extroverts, and ambiverts get energy and where I fall in the spectrum. I've known that I am very much an ambivert but often don't realize why I feel drained in certain situations. Since this gear up I've really begun to notice what situations give me energy and which once zap it and have tried to put myself in those situations that make feel comfortable. In the past I felt like I needed constant social interaction to feel good about myself but I've learned that's definitely not the case.


#### Getting better at difficult things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This was another intriguing professional development session. It was focused around cognitive resources and how they can be easily wasted on things that aren't important. I found this very interesting and thought a lot about this. I've begun to notice the times I feel like I can't think clearly and they almost always occur when my mind has been on something else. Whether it's not feeling great, thinking about a bill I need to pay, or another stress in my life, I've learned that it's very easy to allow your cognitive resources to be wasted on little things that are often not in our control. I've tried to take care of my health so that isn't something that I think about as well as other stresses so that I can put all my cognitive resources into learning programming. 


#### Avoiding burnout

We learned about what causes burnout, the difference between burnout and stress, and how to avoid it. I choose this gear up because burnout was something I was dealing with the week prior.

What I took away from this session is that burnout is different than stress, that it's working so hard and/or long that your mental state changes into one of being apathetic. I learned that, like stress, you need to force yourself to take breaks and do something else besides stare at the computer because when you burn out it's very hard to stay motivated so avoiding it anyway possible is preferred. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to participate in the various activities Turing offered throughout the mod including code fair, the SAB Carnival event, every Mythical Creatures session that Mod 2 put on as well as paired multiple times with Mod 2 students. We were assigned a week to clean the area and I made sure to both clean up our room during this time and the kitchen. I attended happy hour with the Mod 2 students as well as took part in Posse time each week. I realize the importance in making connections at Turing and have done my best to do so.
