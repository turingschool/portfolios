# Eric Jungbluth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having absolutely no coding experience, I set out to get a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as good understanding of basic JavaScript functionality. My goal was to put my head down and work hard, so I could stay ahead of the avalanche of knowledge and work. I feel good about the way the mod went, and think I did a good job of accomplishing the above goals.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

For mod 1 we had one individual project, as well as three static compositions. The project was a simple number guesser game site and the three static compositions were of increasing difficulity.

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Project description
The base requirement for this project was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. It needed to have an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, a button for clearing the input field, and a button that resets the game. It also needed to display the user's most recent guess and display a feedback hint to direct them for their next guess. There were two more phases that added increasing functionality, as well as a final extension phase if you had time.

### Static Comps Project Description
For these project we were given an image for a website and were expcted to recreate it as closely as possible. We were given creative license on the photos and copy, however the objective was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design as far as choice in layout, spacing, font, etc. The comp also needed to be responsive, and have a reasonable amount of ARIA accessibility.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had three partner projects this mod: Linked List, Idea Box, and 2Do Box. We got practice with jQuery, DOM manipulation, and local storage. Also, 2Do Box gave us the opportunity to work with someone else's code, refactor it, and add to it. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Project description
Linked list is a small jQuery application for storing URLs. The base requirement was to have two input fields (One for the title of the bookmark and one for the URL that the bookmark should link to), one button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page. It then needed to append each bookmark created with the title, URL, a button for "Mark as Read", and a delete button. There were also two more phases, as well as a final extension phase.

### Feedback/Coaching
“I think we as a group did a great job of defining what we wanted our partnership to look like from the jump. We were both ready to dive into all the challenges ahead of us and really commit to working through everything together.  We explored a lot of different avenues of attacking a problem, and got exposed to some cool new things that we otherwise probably wouldn’t have found, had we been content to stick to the path.  We were unafraid to fail and did not let failure stop us from learning.

In terms of growth for next time, I think a more systematic approach to the project would have benefited us both greatly, both in terms of time management, and workflow.   I think when we were stuck, it may have been a good idea to reach out sooner than we did.  I think once we were able to pair with Mod 2 students, we made some huge strides with our project.

Overall, I was really happy with our partnership and enjoyed working with you Eric!  Thanks for all the patience and hard work.”

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Project description
Idea Box was our first look at localStorage. We made a small jQuery app that would allow the user to enter an idea with a title. It would be appended to the page with the title and body, as well as a "quality" and delete button. When added to the page, the idea also needed to be added to localStorage, as did the idea's "quality" when it was toggled. Clicking the delete button would also delete the idea from localStorage. We also had to allow the user to edit their ideas after they had been created, and search through their ideas. Finally, there were two other extension phases.


### Evaluation scores/comments
#### html
Love those aria labels
#### css
Love the multiple stylesheets - consider using @import
BEM is getting there - think more in terms of functional components on the page (ie. create-form, search-form)
Great organization
Little duplication
#### js
Pull duplicate blocks of code into a function that takes dynamic pieces as arguments
git/github
Would like to see more commits
Would like to see more info for each commit
#### Functional Expectations
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
#### HTML
#### Accessibility
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
#### Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
#### CSS
#### Structure of Code
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
Exceptional Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.
#### Implementation
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
Exceptional Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.
#### JAVASCRIPT
#### Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
#### Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
#### Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
#### Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
#### Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
#### DOM Manipulation
Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
#### Style
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
#### GIT & GITHUB
#### Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
#### Github
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
#### DESIGN
#### Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
#### PAIRING
#### Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

### Feedback/Coaching
"Eric,

We worked very well together. You have a great work ethic and an impressive aptitude for coding. I appreciate how quickly you were able to solve problems such as the search bar and the content edibility on ‘enter’. Areas to focus on moving forward would be to continue using the dev tools more and more, because the more css you write without checking its effects, the more variables you have when you’re trying to figure out what’s wrong. In total, great job. "

#### 2Do Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/quinhill/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Project description
2Do Box was our first change to work with someone else's code base. For 2Do Box we were given someone else's code from the Idea Box project and asked to refactor it, with a few challenges thrown in (no nested if/else statements, no anonymous functions, no functions longer than 8 lines, etc). We were to clean up the code without changing any of its functionality. After the code was refactored, we were asked to ad new features, such as filtering by level of importance and only showing the 10 most recent 2Dos on the page. Finally, there was an extensions phase with three additional functions to add if we had time.

## D: Professional Skills
This mod we had some sessions that were geared towards helping us become better people and better programmers. The four sessions were Stress Management, Working Styles, Getting Better at Difficult Things, and Relaxation.

### Gear Up
#### Stress Management
In this session I learned about the four typs of stress, as well as ways to reduce stress. This was incredibly helpful, as I have used many of stress-management coping mechanisms (meditation, running, and food prepping) to make my first mod at Turing more manageable. I hope to be able to continue to use what I've learned through the later mods to make my time at Turing successful.

#### Working Styles
In this session I learned about the three different working styles (introvert, extrovert, and ambivert). I was easily able to identify what category I fall in, as well as my preferred working style. I also learned about the other types and their preferred working styles, so I can work more effectively with them in the future.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
This session made me aware that everyone who has learned coding has gone through the same struggle that I'm going through right now. No one is born a natural programmer, everyone just has to keep working at it until they get good. It also reaffirmed my belief that I'm doing what I need to to be able to successfully get through Turing, even if sometimes it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels.

#### Relaxation
This was the mod 4 session I attended. It was somewhat similar to the Stress Management session, but was more focused on the coping mechanisms. I learned some additional ways to manage stress, as well as some good ways to de-stress from the pressure of Turing, one of which I fully intend to try during the break next week.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
My involvement in the Turing community includes attending all but one of the Wrap-Ups, the events (SAB events, Code Fair, etc), and some of the Happy Hours to celebrate/de-stress with the rest of mod 1, as well as people from the upper mods. I scheduled two pairings every week, and even spent a handful of hours walking a group of students from our mod through Mythical Creatures on Saturday to help them prepare for the pentathlon.
