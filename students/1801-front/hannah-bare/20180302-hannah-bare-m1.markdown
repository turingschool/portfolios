## Areas of Emphasis

Deciding to repeat module 1 of Turing's Front End program was a really good decision for me. Going back to school in a completely new language the first go around hit me quite hard and was a battle. Therefore, this time I had a lot of goals that I wanted to accomplish. These included personal goals as well as academic. Personally I recognized that I needed to take time to take care of myself: work out, sleep, and do something that made me feel like myself every once in a while. I really needed to feel more like myself and not a robot trying to fit the mold. I actually allowed myself to take breaks, meditate and call my parents. Academic areas of emphasis included getting more comfortable with these new languages and ways of communicating. I wanted to become more comfortable with javascript and be more of a navigator with projects. I desired to feel capable of being able to do my code not just once, but to be able to re-write it and explain it to others. I wanted to be more of a captain of my learning! Mentally, I wanted to relax and be able to take in information during classes. My anxiety took over my existence last module and I knew that if I didn't pay attention to it then I would have wasted my time repeating. I learned a lot last time, and I learned even more this time. In that relaxation I wanted to be able to feel more confidence and work on being less hard on myself- which I think I accomplished yet can continue to work on. Lastly, I wanted to continue altering my internal dialogue and continue pushing myself towards a growth mindset.

##### Static Comps
##### Description
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. I was asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, I was given a static comp and asked to recreate it. The objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.

##### Description
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).
Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## D: Professional Skills
In Module One, career development is focused on strategies to help students be successful at Turing. The following are key components of this success:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

### Gear Up

#### Stress Management 101
I love this gear up, although I was disappointed to not see the therapist do it last time there. I think that was super valuable to have someone not from Turing share their expertise in regards to mental, emotional and physical health. It was really awesome doing this one again and see my perspective change and retain more of it because of my module repeating. 

#### Working Styles
During this gear up I felt like I was able to really identify what my personality label would be at Turing. I felt like I was able to truly assess whether I am an introvert, ambi or extrovert at Turing- and I am definitely more on the introverted side. I think more than whether someone is an introvert or not, this is just one aspect that can trip up project pairs. For instance, my most challenging pairing was not in differences in extroversion, but in learning styles, motivation, and communication styles.

#### Getting Better at Doing Difficult Things
I loved this gear up. I loved that an instructor in mod3 taught this and was able to bring a unique perspective and twist on the information. In particular, I liked the idea of what is draining my cognative resources- are there distractions? Are there pressures? Are they my internal dialogue? Another aspect that I appreciated was that there was an emphasis on doing things that make you feel like you- which is very important for one's success and self-care. 

#### Mod4 Lead Gear Up: What's your favorite flavor of sh*t sandwich (and does it come with an olive?)
This was really valuable. I've worked in similar working environments basically my whole working life and it was really awesome to explore what really are corporations, small and large, what does remote work really look like, and differences in startup stages. This gear up helped me learn more about what I want so that I can be clearer going into the work force as a web developer.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Ways that I supported the larger Turing community included being active in SAB, initiating conversations during our Friday retros with our cohort to get to know each other better, being an active participant during Bronze FE and encouraging others to join, pairing with other students and instructors, as well as picking up after the building if something needs to be done.
