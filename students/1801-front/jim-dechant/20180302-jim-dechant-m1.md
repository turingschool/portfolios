# Jim Dechant - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to get a good understanding of JavaScript, better understanding of the principals of design, to improve my CSS skills, and to become a better programmer overall. I felt I did well in achieving these goals through-out this module. One of the goals that I had set that I did not do as well as I would have liked was doing code wars daily. I got caught in the whirlwind and ended up using my time in a way I didn't expect going into the module, but I would definitely like to get more code wars reps in during my time at Turing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really enjoyed the individual projects this module, I loved the creative freedom that was allowed to me by the static comps, and I am pleased by how much I enjoyed javascript and how the language clicked for me.

***

#### Number Guesser

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [Evaluation Information](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/number-guesser/jim-dechant.md)

The start of it all... Sure made me feel dumb for a minute wondering why I couldn't link my JavaScript to my HTML. Turns out it doesn't get linked in the head element.. who knew.

***

#### Static Comp 1

Re-create the comp provided, keep that HTML/CSS muscle strong.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/jd-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

I feel that I did well on this project. Area's I could have improved was more ARIA functionality.

***

#### Static Comp 2

Re-create the comp provided, keep that HTML/CSS muscle strong.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/jd-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I feel that I did well on this project. Area's I could have improved was more ARIA functionality, and better design on my mobile media query (looking at you hamburger menus)

***

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I had a lot of fun with my group work this module. I very much enjoyed meeting all these new awesome people and learning from them as well as being able to teach them some stuff too.

***

#### Linked List

A user can submit a title and a valid website URL to create 'bookmarked cards' that did not have to persist on page reload.
These cards can be 'marked as read' or deleted.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [Evaluation Information](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/linked-list/jim-david.md)

I had a great time on this project. I had a wonderful partner and got introduced to debugger.

***

#### IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/ideaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [Evalulation Information](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/idea-box/seamus-jim.md)

I had a lot of fun on this project, I learned a ton and had an awesome partner. It was cool to improve on using debugger and learning about local storage. Probably my favorite group project of the mod.

***

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

Inherit someoneâ€™s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)
* [Evaluation Information](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/to-do-box/jim-dechant.md)

This project was a little bit frustrating for me trying to coordinate with my partner. I ended up doing this project solo due to my partner choosing to repeat the module. I did enjoy it and was challenged when trying to deal with local storage in a way that I had not encountered. Unfortunately, the challenge got the better of me but I was able to learn a lot of great things in my eval.

## D: Professional Skills

It was interesting to do these sessions over again after some time away from them. I was able to more clearly see the value of these sessions this time around. Slightly off, topic I would have been very interested in seeing if/how my strengths finders results may have changed due to my experiences over the last 4 months.

### Gear Up
#### Session Name

**[Growth Mindset](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)**

I was able to see how fixed mindset had hurt me in the past and made a big change into having and keeping a growth mindset in all the things that I do. Something I have started to notice after this session is how people speak. This can be a good indicator to which mindset they are in. I continue to watch myself and try to notice if I start to fall towards a fixed mindset and steer myself away from that.

***

**[Getting Better at Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)**

I've had to do some reorganizing of my 'cards' and be more aware of moving skills from one area to another. Breaking up skills into more manageable pieces so that I can get them into columns 'b' and 'c' sooner than trying to tackle the entire skill at once.

***

**[Working Styles - intro, extro, ambiverts!](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)**

I feel that this session provided the least amount of value for me this inning. I enjoyed it the first time I went through it and it was great to learn about the different ways people need to 'recharge'. I definitely had a misconception about introverts, extroverts, and didn't even know about ambiverts. I was a little surprised to find my self further towards the introvert side of the wall this time around. I learned you can be outgoing and involved in a lot of things and still be an introvert.

***

**[Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)**

A very under-rated gear up in my opinion. This session provides so much value that many folks don't utilize. I myself am guilty of that; when I get caught up in the whirlwind of Turing I find it can be difficult to manage my stress, and take the time to handle it properly. It is something I would like to be more aware of in the future and something that will be useful for the rest of my life.

***

**[Personal Stories and Connections](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)**

This one was interesting for me. Hands down I got amazing value out of this, but it came from outside of Turing. I was talking with someone who used to work for GE in China and I was amazed at how much of a difference a well crafted personal story can make.

I was explaining Turing's emphasis on building soft skills and personal stories and was asked to tell mine. I told him it was still rusty and needed work but gave him a portion of my story. He politely stopped me and told me how generic my story was and then proceeded to tell me my own story back to me. I was stunned at how good it was and couldn't believe that it was my same story!

I learned a lot from that conversation and have been working on making my story much better and look forward to future conversations with this individual.

***

**Learn Through Teaching - Mod 4 led Gear up**

I had a lot of fun in this gear-up. Having spent more time trying to teach people this inning I appreciated this gear up. It helped me to improve as both a mentor and a mentee. It also provided me with tactics that I could use to make more meaningful relationships with my mentors and to provide more value to those I help.

***

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have been fortunate enough to have gone through 2 modules with some amazing people and they really helped me understand how beneficial and awesome the community can be here at Turing but in order to experience that you need to reach out and give back. I was hesitant to reach out when I first started and I saw how un-beneficial that was, and how much value came from reaching out and forming that relationship with another student. With this in mind, I set out to take a larger part in the community this mod.

Knowing what it is like to be in the mucks trying to figure things out, and to be in a position to help students in my module was a wonderful opportunity. I learned a lot from those I helped and learned other skills I hadn't expected to learn this module. Also joining the S.A.B. this inning was a fun experience to see a little deeper into how the Turing machine works. I found lots of value from this as well and I hope to be an even better rep for my peers next module.
