# Jim Dechant - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

_This inning my goals were to do code-wars more regularly, continue to improve my GitHub workflow, and technical articulation. Another area I wanted to focus on was taking care of my health via exercising in the morning, after game time I felt a bit overwhelmed and exercising each morning fell off the wagon very quickly. Next module I hope to keep doing code-wars, keep improving all the skills I have developed thus far, and developing a better morning routine._

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_I felt like we didn't have any individual work projects this inning. Even though 'sorting suite' and 'complete me' were called solo projects they felt more like a class project. I feel like I would have gotten much more benefit if these had been paired projects. I'd say 'sorting suite' was the most challenging solo project this mod. Both projects were great for practicing array prototypes, recursion, and understanding the call-stack which helped me improve the skills I have been developing. Next module I would like to collaborate more with my classmates, but being careful not to lose out on learning while doing so._

### Study Habits

_I didn't change much from the last inning, I did have more later nights than before. One area I would like to improve in would be timeboxing. I would like to set aside an hour in the morning and evening for skills improvement, code-wars, repls, reading this pile of tech books that have been piling up._

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_I really enjoyed learning more about recursion and getting to practice with it. I also had a lot of fun trying to explain the call stack and coming up with different ways to explain how things were working under the hood. I feel the project would have been more beneficial to most people as a pair partner project instead of a class project. It was cool that there were chunks of collaboration all through the classroom but I felt it hindered the learning of some. This project is great for goals beyond Turing because understanding how sorting algorithms is a very important concept to know for job interviews and programs/apps you may work with in the future._

### Complete Me
* **Process** _3_
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **TDD & Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _4_

_I enjoyed building something that is used in most peoples lives these days. It was also fun to do this project through TDD instead of writing code then tests. As stated in sorting suite I felt that this projects as a class project hurt the learning of some, but it was cool to see different groups come together to work on this. I also think that this is another very important concept to understand for interviews and programming in general._

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Overall I really enjoyed the group projects, I was fortunate enough to have wonderful partners for both projects so it really helped shape the experience on both projects. I learned a lot from each project and was inspired to push my skills and workflow to higher-levels by both of my partners. What was challenging is when we both got to a point where we got stuck and fighting through that spot. This was a great practice in using our resources we had available, searching for answers to our questions, and reaching out instead of trying to solve something we didn't understand fully._

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Tyler McNamara_
* **Game:** _Burger Time_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_I enjoyed finishing it! This project resulted in many late nights, and I think the complexity of it made things much more difficult than necessary. Taking on and trying to finish a project of our scope (especially with all the new things we were not comfortable with at the time, testing, making dumb classes, assigning logic to certain areas) in the given timeline was very challenging. Though this can be a fun project I didn't feel like I got a good learning experience out of it. I think two 1 week projects focused on array prototypes, class interactions, parent/child classes, and testing would have been much more beneficial to me._

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_
* **Spec Adherence:** _4_
* **User Interface:** _3.5_
* **HTML Style:** _4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _3.5_
* **JS/React Style:** _3_
* **Testing & Sanitation:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _4_

_I loved this project! I felt like this was the only valuable project this module. I see the value in both sorting-suite and complete me but I think how they were delivered took a lot of the value away. I didn't feel like I learned much the previous month, and the stuff I was expected to know to pass mod two was hardly touched on in class and was expected to be done on our own time. This project is different from all that though, I felt like I learned a lot, I had fun struggling through and figuring things out and it was cool to make progress and breakthroughs with a partner again. Oh, and we got to use CSS again, yay! (would have loved to use sass, but we had issues with that... another time sass... another time.) Definitely my favorite project of Mod2._

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * [Agile](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_and_leadership.md)
  * [Feedback II](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)
  * [Storytelling II](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/professional_storytelling_ii.md)
  * [Feedback III](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_iii.md)
  * [Outreach & Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_and_networking.md)

_Having done these sessions once before I felt like I didn't get quite as much value on them the second time around, but it gave me an opportunity to see if I had missed any important nuggets of information, and also the chance to improve my personal story and work on my storytelling skills._

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * [Empathy & Privilege](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown)
  * [Group Think](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)
  * [Finding Common Ground]()

_I think these sessions are valuable, but what I see happening often is students get overwhelmed with the amount that there is to do and these sessions fall straight to the bottom of the priority list. I was definitely guilty of this during this inning. I think the Group Think session was the most valuable as Turing is its own little bubble and we can sometimes forget about the outside world, it was a good reminder of that._

## Community Participation

_At the beginning of the inning I spent a lot of time pairing with mod 1 folks, I cut this time down as the inning progressed so I did not fall behind. I also participated in S.A.B. Lastly I had a lot of fun getting to know my cohort mates better and meeting with some of them outside of Turing to hang out and enjoy small glimpses of freedom._

## Final Assessment

_Over intermission week I plan on doing codeWars, object repls, react tutorials, rebuilding mod1 projects, getting better at vim, and the mod 3 pre-work. What I am looking forward to the most about next inning is getting much stronger with reactJS and being ready to find work after the inning! To recharge I will enjoy some quality time with this Nintendo Switch that I pre-emptively purchased... Also, a mountain bike ride or 4 would be awesome._
