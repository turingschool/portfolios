# Jim Dechant - M4 Portfolio

#### [30 Day Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=b2lzaHRxMjgxY3JldWVrajFva2V2Z2E3NHNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Completing the program! I really wanted to go out on my own after Mod-3, having done a portion of the backend program and going through the frontend program- I have been at Turing for a long time! I am glad of the decision to stay and complete mod 4 and finish out the program the right way.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Senioritus. It was hard to keep motivation in this stage of the game. Many late nights and long weekends over the 10 months, being this close to the end made it hard to keep focus. 

What I learned from this was to look at the big picture and keep focus and fight those urges to just not do the things. It can be easy to fall behind, but if you do a little bit every day it is easy to stay ahead. Learning to reward myself after the things are done instead of before.

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I feel like I put a focus of getting back into healthy habits and routines, I made time to ride my bike each morning instead enjoying ease of travel with a vehicle. Kept up with push-up poms (along with Eric). Established our in class Job-Board, Meet-Up-Board, and countdown to graduation Timer. Establish a job opportunity (that may turn into a job offer) through networking.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

It hasn't changed my mind in regards to wanting to work in frontend, but it did re-ignite my curiosity for developing on the other side of the stack. This is something I plan on revisiting down the line after I get a better with the languages I was learning during Mod 1-3.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Communication and collaboration. Practicing working on teams while at Turing is something I feel was extremely valueable and will take into most everything I do outside of Turing.
