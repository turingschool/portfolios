### Static Comp Challenge

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

#### Feedback from Laura
What a project we delivered! I feel like I learned a ton working with you, Javascript is your  language! I appreciated the time you took to explain things with me when I had questions and I’m glad you were ok with coding next to each other for the first project. My only suggestion is to try and kick off the project with your next partner instead of surging ahead. I know you’re experienced in HTML and CSS, but I would have preferred to still work on that together or discuss the initial coding, but I’m glad there were still changed left for me to make and learning to be had! Towards the end of the project, I found myself dreading changing partners!”

#### Evaluation Comments -- Evaluated by Nathaniel 

#### Evaluation Scores

##### Functional Expectations

*Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
Does not save when quality changes

#### HTML

##### Accessibility

*Novice Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
*No alt tags for img elements

##### Style

*Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
*Poor Indentation

##### Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

##### Implementation

* Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#### JAVASCRIPT

##### Data Types

* Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

##### Conditional Logic

* Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

##### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

##### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

##### Objects & Prototypes

* Novice Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.  
##### DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

##### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs..

#### GIT & GITHUB

##### Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

#### DESIGN

##### Comp Recreation

* Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### PAIRING

* Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### Feedback from Angela

* I really enjoyed working with Stephanie on our project. She had more knowledge than me as far as Javascript goes, so she was really patient with me learning and putting in new functions to our code. I was really happy we were able to understand our code the more we worked on it together and googled new things we did not know. I appreciate her being such a good partner and being able to get along with me just fine since i was working a slower pace than she was. In future, it would be recommended that she try to meet up more in person and work together on producing more code.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* **Growth Mindset:** I think that this session was a good reminder of how we need to approach Turing and any sort of obstacles. We don't want to close ourselves off to potential possibilities just because we think that we can't do soemthing. It's important to think about the process, and not necessarily just someone's intelligence or ability. Also it's good to feel comfortable being uncomfortable. 

* **Working Styles:** I have always been a very extroverted person, although I do have some introverted tendencies. It was interesting to talk about different working styles with people who identify as introverts, and see how sometimes introverts and extroverts understand each other differently in the workplace. When an extrovert might just trying to be friendly, that might feeling overwhelming for a person who is introverted and needs more time to themselves. 

* **Getting Better at Difficult Things:** This Gear Up was interesting because we talked about how it's important that we don't burn through our cognitive resources. Also it emphasized the importance of our emotional mindset too. The article we read in that session, reminded me a lot of what I went through when I was learning Madrid in Spain. Sometimes our biggest enemy can be ourselves when we aren't gentle with the fact that learning new things takes time. 

* **Storytelling and Strengths:** This was a really insightful Gear Up for me because I purposely tried to find two people that I didn't know as much about. We were able to have a really genuine and honest talk about our pasts and what brought us to Turing. I have felt closer to both the people I spoke to, and I think that is also reflected in our relationships in and out of class. 

* **Debugging the Gender Gap:** I really enjoyed watching this documentary and seeing what to expect in the workforce when we finish Turing. I know that the documentary is a few years old, but I still felt really disappointed that this is our reality as women in tech. I left the Gear Up with mixed emotions, because I felt both motivated to keep paving the way for any young girls that want to be developers, but also really sad about the fact that I probably will face some sort of discrimination as a female developer. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've had 2+ pairing sessions a week, and I go to Joan Clarke meetings in the morning. I've also gone to some of the Health and Wellness lunches when I haven't had pairing sessions. Also, I am part of TAAAP which is how I have met some of the TAAAP alum and other TAAAPers in other mods. Also on Thursdays, I go to Brother's with other Turing students for some time away from code and $2 burgers.
