## A: Individual Work & Projects

### Swapi Box 

I loved this project! The point of this project was to take static data files and, using React, display the data to the page. Using Jest and Enzyme, we built a test suite for the application., the biggest win for me in this project was testing.

#### Evaluation Comments
Comments: Nice job!!

Rubric

Specification Adherence: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
#### Evaluation Scores

#### Functional Expectations
4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
#### Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
#### Css/Design
3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
#### Testing
3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
#### PropType Implementation
- Pass
#### README
- Pass

### HeadCount 

The point of this project was to take static data files and, using React, display the data to the page. We made each dataset into cards, which can then be clicked on to compare two datasets. Using Jest and Enzyme, we built a test suite for the application.

### MovieTracker 


The point of this project was to take use data from a movie API, using React, display the data to the page. We used Jest and Enzyme as test suite for the application.

#### Evaluation Scores

#### Functional Expectations
4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
#### Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
#### Css/Design
3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
#### Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
#### Redux
4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
#### Router
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
#### PropType Implementation
- Pass
#### README
- Pass

### AWC Dance 

This is my personal project, a social media app for dancers. In the front end I used React, Redux and Scss. In the back end I used Aws to build my own Api, authorize and manage users, set up my database and to deploy it.

#### Evaluation Comments

Rubric

#### Evaluation Scores

#### Functional Expectations
4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.
#### Code Quality
4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
#### Css/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
#### Testing
4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
#### Redux
4-: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.
#### Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
#### Code Sanitation
3 - Five or fewer complaints
