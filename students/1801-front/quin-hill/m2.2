## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_
I had many areas I wanted to focus on, but most of all I wanted to feel capable of doing any of the projects on my own if I had to. I feel that I accomplished that goal and that I had a much better understanding of everything I did, from scope, to array prototype methods.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I was very proud of the individual projects I did. It was much more fun working on them than it had been last inning. I would get very excited as I got close to solving a problem. I was sad when Megan decided not to continue, because I really enjoyed working with her on the personal projects, and I feel strongly that I do my best work in pairings, when I can talk through a problem with someone.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

I would say that my study habits changed naturally. At times when I had felt completely overwhelmed last inning, I was intrigued this time around. I wanted to figure out that last missing bit when I got home. I felt much more relaxed about everything and was able to just pick up on everything my mind had shut out last time around.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed the process of working through heap-sort with Megan. I don't remember specifics of getting there, but I remember being excited about figuring it out. It was especially helpful in really thinking through a problem that required multiple steps within the same function. I think it required me to have a real understanding of what I would be getting at each step and how to manipulate an array at each iteration to get the desired result.

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

complete-me was very frustrating. It was slow getting started, then started moving along. I enjoyed determining and implementing the logic of optimize, which got me about 90% of the way there. However, it failed me for the final 10%, which was extremely tiring. With the help of my mentor, I would finally able to find the flaw in my code and get it over the finish line. What I like about complete-me, is that it shows how programming can be used in the real world to optimize UX.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

game-time was fun. I was partnered with David, who is a strong coder. We moved along very quickly after a few early hindrances. I was very happy with the way we thought it through and implemented it. It helped me with understanding how to use arrays and objects in a very visual way. 

### Weathrly

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed working in React on Weathrly. I was partnered with Spenser, who was very quick to pick things up and we were able to make a lot of progress very quickly. I was very happy with the result. I was happy to have a much better understanding of how to pass props and data from one component to another.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I paired with some mod-1 people. I paired with some people in my mod and created an object for my mod to practice array prototype methods.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I think I'll try to work on some personal project in react over the break. I was also considering trying to teach myself a little Swift.
