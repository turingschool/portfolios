## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects we had in this module were swapi-box and our personal project. It was interesting to feel how I had developed since my first time through mod2. I had preferred to work on projects in pairings then, but now I found myself getting picky on how the code was written and growing frustrated over differences in coding styles.

#### Swapi-Box

* https://github.com/quinhill/swapibox

Swapi-Box was the first project I worked on with multiple and nested API calls. We used the Swapi API https://swapi.co/. I was proud that I had made a dynamic function, that would process all of the API fetches, triggered by a user click event.

I did find that I was too focused on the coding and refactoring, and that my testing and linting took the hit for that.

#### Soccer-Scores

* https://github.com/quinhill/soccer-score

For my personal project, I made a live score app for soccer. It would make fetch calls to the SportMonks API https://sportmonks.com/, to get data for all the games of the day, the teams of those games and their players. With Router, the app would render a page for each of the individual data sets (all games, detailed game, team, and player). I used Thunk middleware for all the fetch GET requests.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* Headcount2.0
* MovieTracker

I enjoyed the group projects, but found myself wanting to take on more on my own. I did profit from the different strengths of my partners, however. There were often aspects of a project at which I found myself struggling and my partner would have the answer.

#### Headcount2.0

* https://github.com/quinhill/headcount2.0
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0

Headcount was a React challenge. We had to access and clean data to be displayed on the page as cards. Then we made them searchable and comparable to each other.

#### MovieTracker

* https://github.com/quinhill/movietracker
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker

MovieTracker was the first project I worked on that required a backend. We also used Redux and made fetch POST calls for the first time. The project used the Movie Database API https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en. We enabled users to create an account and favorite movies they were interested in.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported the community most in pairing with people to solve more complex issues in their code.
