# Quinlan Hill - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I decided to focus on prototype methods and becoming comfortable using them.

## Self-Evaluation

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Professional Skills**: 2
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: 1

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects definitely helped me in understanding prototype methods. I did find it frustrating not to have a visual of what was going on, which made it much more difficult for me. I discovered that I don't make much progress in big groups, but learn quite a lot working with just one or two people, where I can contribute more. In a group I find I am in danger of letting myself rely on others too much.

### Study Habits

I found it difficult to maintain enough energy to study after class. Especially during the individual projects. When I had a partner, I found it easier to invest more time after class and on weekends. I found that throughout the mod I had many different external factors that influenced my study habits. Running out of my ADHD medication, having to move in week 5 of the mod. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I didn't enjoy much about sorting suite. I found working as a group hard, because I understood what the code we put together, but I didn't feel I could have figured it out on my own, or that I contributed as much as I should have to profit from it, since there are always people in the group that will get there faster than I will. It did help me in my areas of emphasis. I learned how to implement some prototype methods I hadn't previously used. I really didn't enjoy the project, but I did understand the necessity to learn the concepts behind sorting and it forced me to learn things that I didn't have fun doing.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 2
* **Testing:** 2
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 2
* **Functional Expectations:** 2
* **Code Sanitation:** 2

I was sick for two days during that week and I had to get a lot of help to get this project done. With this project, I also felt I Like I would not have been able to solve it on my own. It forced me to gain a better understanding of objects and nodes, dot notation and bracket notation. I believe, just trying to solve the problem posed by the project and spending time on it, improved my level of comfort with javascript in general, but it was not an enjoyable process.

## B: Group Work & Projects

I really liked the pair projects, but as I mentioned before, I didn't feel I was able to benefit as much from working in a group. I would like to try to implement ways of working one-on-one more often, in preparing for things and studying.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Alan
* **Game:** Breakout
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

I enjoyed working on game time a lot and I was happy with the pairing. I liked the logic of the collision detection. The connection between different classes was difficult for me at first, but it taught me a lot in that regard. 


### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Cameron
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 3
* **HTML Style:** 3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 2
* **Workflow:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

I enjoyed getting to know react. I was challenged by external factors during this project, because I had to move over the weekend. I would have liked to spend a lot more time on it and I increased the workload for my partner, because of it. I am excited about what I learned on React and I know I will be using it a lot in the future at Turing and beyond.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _List here_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

* **Gear Up Sessions:**

I do find the conversations we have during gear-up important, but I also often feel too exhausted, or under pressure to work on something, to profit from them. I liked the motivation to reach out to people in the industry, which I have started to implement already in the form of lining up some job shadows.

## Community Participation

I had quite a few pairings with people from mod-1. I found that solidified my knowledge was quite affirming. I always do my best to be friendly and harmonizing. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_
I would like to cement my knowledge of react. I plan on coding out weatherly on my own, since I didn't feel I could have done it without my partner and I think it would also solidify my general understanding of materials we learned in mod-2. Other than that, I want to practice some driving to get my license and start jogging again.
