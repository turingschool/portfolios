# Angela Deslandes - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had a little bit of knowledge in HTML and CSS before entering this program. Since my current major is Computer Science, I wanted to gain more knowledge and hands on experience that I did not get in college. I have definitely learned so much in this Module and am satisfied with my progress thus far. I've continued having good study habits and maintained the work load to prevent stress with any projects. I am confident that I will be able to carry this same mind set in Module 2.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual Projects Include:

* Number Guesser
* Static Comp 1
* Static Comp 2
* Static Comp 3

  * Number Guesser was our only individual project that contained Javascript. The static comps we had to do were mainly html and css. For the number guesser project, we created a simple webpage layout for users that guess a number between 1 and 100. As you go further in the phases, there are more steps added in, for example, have the user specify the range themselves and not have it set to be 1 to 100. Our concentration in the static comp projects are to recreate a layout given to us, but while keeping the same structure. We also had to make the webpage responsive to all screen sizes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* Linked List
* Ideabox
* To Do Box Pivot

  * The group projects consisted of 3 paired programming assignments: Linked List, IdeaBox, and ToDoBox. Each project expanded on the previous and added new features requiring us to expand our javascript, jQuery, and html/css skills. The final paired project, ToDoBox, was an interesting exercise in which we were given another group's IdeaBox project and tasked with parsing, re-factoring, and adding new features to effectively pivot the IdeaBox to the ToDoBox theme without scraping the original code base.

Person Feedback from Partner (Camilo Snapp):

“I feel fortunate that I paired with you during my first real build of an application. Thanks to your perseverance we were
able to complete the project throughly. I felt that these good qualities allowed us to be successful. Despite unforeseen
difficulties. I enjoyed your positivity when we completed a step. This is something I sometimes miss because I focus too much on the next problems. It reminded me that we are accomplishing the tasks at hand. Don’t let your fear stop you from breaking down the problem. You can always analyze the problem in a birds eye level and break it down. Ask you self what am I trying to accomplish in English and then break it down from from a big problem to smaller problems. Then Google on to translate solving the problem in code. Being a good programmer is really learning how to solve problems and become comfortable being challenged and not knowing the answers. It felt like more than 4 days but we learned so much. Keep in mind we just developed a full application!”

Person Feedback from Partner (Stephanie Ospina):

"Angela, Thanks for your contribution on this project, this was definitely a hard one but we finished it!!  Thanks for your patience and hard work, your CSS and HTML knowledge really helped us, also you have great communication skills and you're very dedicated. Overall we did very good, I think we just need more practice with JS and Jquery and get better at reading other people's code. Good job and keep it up!"

## D: Professional 
Skills

### Gear Up

#### Working Styles

* [Working Styles](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

  * Working styles was an interesting Gear Up. We discussed the 3 different types of work styles (introvert, extrovert, and ambivert) and I found myself going to a group of people who are introverts just like me. We were all able to relate to a good amount of things that we do the same. It's funny because one person I talk to the most at Turing is categorized as an extrovert, according to that session, and we get along great. I was able to find out a lot about myself that day and discuss the different ways on how we all would work together.
  
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [Getting Better at Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

  * This particular Gear Up made me realize that there are a lot more people like me than I realized. Most of the students at Turing go through the same kind of struggle but we all work together so we all can improve. I have definitely gained more knowledge and experience here in 6 weeks than I did doing a semester at a regular college, and it feels great to be where I am right now. I just need to keep powering through and it will be worth it in the end.
  
#### Health & Wellness - Stress Management

* [Stress Management](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

  * I found out that there are 4 different types of stress and discussed ways to reduce it. Managing stress is really important to have a healthy lifestyle. I learned that I just need to take a step back every once in awhile to calm down or take a break and go do something I enjoy, whether it is doing yoga/going for a run or taking the time to prep good meals for lunch everyday.
  
#### MOD4 Gear Up - Ethics in AI

  * This was a great gear up that some of the module 4 students set up. We basically broke into a few groups, read articles about different subjects in AI and had a discussion about them. My group read over an article about the Cultural Significance of Artificial Intelligence and I was able to learn a few new things in the process. I am eager to learn more about this topic in the future so I can stay knowledgable in all fields of technology.
  
## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Starting at Turing, I didn't have a lot of knowledge or experience so I wanted to devote my time to practicing code and studying new material. So I havent joined any particular groups or taken an leadership roles. But I have been pairing quite often and talking to other students in my module, and others, for help if I have any questions. I have been doing my best to also learn by teaching where I feel confident. Every Saturday and Sunday I spend several hours at Turing or another location with fellow students to improve my coding skills as well.
