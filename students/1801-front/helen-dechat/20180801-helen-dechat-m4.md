 ## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Simply, my biggest achievement was  following through with all the expected assignments and deliverables. By Mod 4 I was very tired. The enthusiasm that fed the energy to get through the first 3 mods was gone. This mod was about discipline and work ethic. 
 
 ## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
 Pushing through my lack of motivation. However, the struggle showed me that I definitely want to pursue a coding career. I started the program knowing that it was possible that somewhere in the middle of the program, I would realize that it’s not really for me. Once I hit the wall, I knew I needed a break, but still... I really, really like to code.

 ## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
My capstone partner and I built an app which features realtime chat using Socket.io API. Also, I'm pretty sure I emptied out the vending machine doughnuts on a weekly basis.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
It confirmed something that I began to suspect much earlier on. I’m more of a backend person. I’m not so much into the styling of visuals, design, css etc. I have much more enjoyed the logic of javascript functions, testing, and setting up redux architecture, creating endpoints and databases etc. I have no regrets about choosing the front-end program. I love working with React and Redux and still have so much to learn. But, I will definitely be going through the backend curriculum on my own and I'm excited about that.

 ## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
I have a better understanding and appreciation of my own problem-solving methods. But most importantly, I can build a website!
