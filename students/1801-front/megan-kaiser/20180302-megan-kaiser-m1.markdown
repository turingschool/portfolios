# Megan Kaiser - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I began my studies at Turing in order to learn as much as I could about becoming a web developer, which I have excelled at so far. This module I significantly improved in the areas I already was strongest in, and as a result won't have to use my cognitive resources as much during the rest of my time at Turing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The personal projects I did this mod were focused on personal growth, as I sought to learn  new approaches from the prevoius mod. I pushed myself to finish phase four for every project, and was proud to accomplish that in every personal project.

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. I went to phase four and make a unicorn game for kids to play. 

##### evaluation comments:
Loved Unicorn Guesser! Very cool extension! Also, cool that you got the 'done' button working!
Code for phases 1-3 looked clean
css-consider organizational comments
js-try finding duplicate lines of code and breaking out into functions

It was hard to not work with someone on this project, when asking for help no one knew my code well enough to actully help.

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike). Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

##### evaluation comments: 
Refactored too much, shouldn't be getting rid of global variables. I had some duplicate lines of code due to the no global varibles.

##### description: 
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked to learn about my partners working styles. I gained valuable experience white boarding with Hannah, as well as  learning critical multitasking skills with Jack. 
 
#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/linkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### description:
It’s time to try your hand at building a small application to store website links.
In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:Two input fields, One for the title of the bookmark, One for the URL that the bookmark should link to, One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page, A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display: The title of the bookmark, The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL), A button to “Mark as Read”, A button to “Remove” the bookmark

##### evaluation comments: 
Through Phase 4 with some bugs,
Clear read bookmarks button not working,
Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up,
Nice job with README

#### 2doBox

##### description: 
For this project we were given code from a pair of classmates that created idea box. We were instructed to pivot the project into another project, were we created a platform that houses a to-do list. We also added new features including better ux/iu design of disabling the save button when there is insufficient information in inputs as well as created a completed check button for when the user has finished the task.

## D: Professional Skills
I found all of the PD sessions very helpful, and learned from strength finder that some of my strongest features as a programer include responsibility, adaptability, context, futuristic, and arranger. As I repeated the module, I realized clearly how I should have used these critical skills much more aggressively the first time I went through mod one. I know my  Linkedin and Twitter were both professionally sound before I began classes at Turing, and feel excellent about their current state. I also made my Github significantly stronger over break using the tools I learned during my first attempt at mod one, and fortunately this time around I had to make very few changes. I am currently working to make my story more about me, and less scripted-feeling. I will continue to work on it during break until its perfect.

### Gear Ups

 ###### Stress Mgmt 101
 Redoing this gear up didn't make me feel stressed whatsoever, unlike my first attempt. It was very productive for me to revisit stress and I now feel much well equipped to hand it in the future. I was happy to clearly remember things we learned about the brain instead of just vaguely knowing we talked about them, but this time I can remember the hind, mid, and frontal cortex.
 
 ###### Working Styles
 I have never viewed myself as anything other than introverted, but I've recently realized that you aren't one thing all the time. You can one work on tasks one way at the office but another at home, etc. I was shocked that I wasn't the straight introvert I imagined, but actaully right down the middle. I'm flexible at a lot of things but going full extrovert isn't something I think I will overcome over anytime soon.  
 
 ###### Getting Better at Doing Difficult Things
  It was super cool to watch that video and learn about cognitive resources. Thankfully the resources I use on javascript were so much smaller than last mod. I don't have to think about git and only had one git merge error all mod, compared to last mod when I experienced them weekly. My emotional state this mod hasn't been as level as I would like, but I'm working hard to improve it and will have that down successfully for mod 2. I continue to use my growth midset and work on making my cognitive resources smaller everyday. 
 
 ###### Mod4 Lead Gear Up: Introvert to Influencer	
   It was interesting to learn about being more outgoing from a video that told me to "fake it until I become it". 
At the time I thought that was crappy advice, but after my boyfriend and I discussed it in detail that night I realized the video was actually right. 

## E: Community Participatio

### Playing a Part

 Since I was repeating this time, I speant a lot of time helping my classmates improve their work. I was a TA for Try Turing one weekend. I led a study session  last weekend for a group classmates to go over wish list as a group. I'm thankful that I've been able to have been a shoulder to cry on for others, and that people who have choosen to repeat are asking me for advice. And as always I continue to tell people about Turing and hand out some cards to people.
