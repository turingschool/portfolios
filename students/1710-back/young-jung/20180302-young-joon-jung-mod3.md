# Young Joon Jung - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis  
I set out to learn about API and how to create and consume them. I also wanted to start thinking about preparing for the job hunt.

I struggled during this mod when it came to my learning, I felt very confident during the first two weeks after doing well on Rales Engine but the brownfield project and having a lot of new information about new concepts with not very much reinforcement rattled my mental capacity and my confidence and I didn't learn as much as I could have. I felt that lack of confidence through to the final eval where I performed badly and my final project which didn't meet my expectations.  Although there are some areas where I feel weak on and will spend time on improving, I feel that I am ready to move onto the next level.  I feel that there was too much pressure on the job hunt during this mod, maybe for some that is fine but I struggled and needed to back off on thinking about the job hunt. Yes, getting grads placed sooner is better for the grad as well as for Turing's reputation but learning is important as well. Maybe move the job hunt pressure towards the end of the mod with less pressure.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[hiking-friends](https://shrouded-castle-30025.herokuapp.com/)**
> **[Github Repo](https://github.com/seoulstice/hiking_friends)**
>* The intention of the app was to create a rideshare for users to either look for trails to create rideshares to and/or for users to join created rideshares.  
>* I felt that my app idea was a good was and I enjoyed working on this app and I have plans to continue with this idea in Mod4 by rebuilding it in a different tech stack.  I tried to implement Facebook Oauth in order to eventually use their 'Mutual Friends' ability and eventually gave up and ran into issues where I fell behind my intended workflow and started worrying about meeting my MVP.  I also tried to make too complicated of a beginning user story and spent too much time on big picture problems when I should have been tackling a smaller user story.  In the end my app did not quite meet my MVP but I am still proud of what I built.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/seoulstice/rales_engine)**
>* 
>* I had a great experience working on this project, I learned a lot about building APIs and had a good experience collaborating with my group partner.  I also learned a lot about testing API requests.  

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/seoulstice/le_pivot)**
>* This app was a brownfield project for a group of 3-4 people to tackle with the intent of implementing extra features and users stories and tackling concepts such as multi-tenancy.
>* This project was very difficult, in the beginning my group did not do as good a job as we should have on organization and wire-framing and that definitely led to problems down the line.  I had a good experience working with my teammates though I didn't feel that there were aspects of the project that I didn't get to touch so I didn't learn much about.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> I felt that the Gearup about Microagressions was helpful because we often sometimes say things that could be taken as a microagression when we might not intend to be that way.  The Tragedy of the Commons GearUp was interesting because it had a visual aspect that demonstrated the concept in a more understandable way and it showed how tech can be used to inform people.I participated in the Mod4 lead GearUp about introverts which I found helpful and hope to use some of those concepts during my future job search.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Over the break between Mods 2 and 3 I spent time with Ellen Mary at a local elementary schol with a group of Turing students where we spend time with kids in a computer science program and allowed them to show us their projects and to show them our projects.

#### **Posse**
  >* I have no spent much time with posses, I mostly utilized that time trying to keep up.
  
#### **Playing a Part**

> I plan to volunteer again with Ellen Mary and other Turing students over the break between Mod 3 and Mod 4 at another local Denver school.
