## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

After failing to meet the standard my first time through Module 1 with 1706, I
came into 1708 feeling a mix of emotions including self-doubt, worry, and feeling
like an imposter.  At one point I had considered taking 6 weeks off to self-study
and coming back in with 1710 but after thinking about it and knowing that my
failure wasn't due to lack of effort more I felt comfortable with the decision to
go into 1708.  My goal from the start of the module was to learn to code, to go
from completing zero projects in 1706 to proving that I could learn to code in 1708.
I feel that I have been successful in my goal, through my effort and the help of
others who offered their time to me I feel that I now have a good grasp of Ruby syntax
and style and can code.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I still struggled in the beginning with my ruby syntax and style and method length.
Over time and help that I received in Andrew Wooten's pairings I have a much better
grasp of refactoring and how to chain methods.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project surprisingly has been Battleship.  Battleship was a project that
I couldn't even get past the start menu during my last iteration of Mod 1 and I made
it a goal to try my best at it and I ended up finishing it late in the night before
the evaluation, with an extension.

My least favorite I guess would be Black Thursday mostly because of how much of a
convoluted some of the relationships can be but it's good practice.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I have learned that I need to be organized in my thoughts when starting a project, I
wrote down a lot of my thoughts after reading the spec of Battleship and I felt
like that helped me a lot.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I have improved my use of Git/Github, I have learned how to pair with people, I have
slightly improved my ability to explain things to people, and I have learned how
to use the strength of two minds to tackle complex problems.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up session this module was the one conducted by Mod 4 students
titled "The Robots Are Coming".  This Gear Up session was my first choice
because of my interest in AI/Machine Learning and the implications that these
technologies have for the future.  I don't have a least favorite Gear Up.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I wasn't able to contribute as much as I would have liked to as I mostly kept my
head down and concentrated on learning the material and getting projects done.  I
did offer help to those in my cohort and answered any questions asked of me and
hopefully in the future I'll be able to help more people as I improve as a coder.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to involve myself more in some of the different lunch groups and I'm
also interested to see how posse time is used in the future, my group had talked
about playing with a Raspberry Pi.
