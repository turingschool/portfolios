### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
My biggest achievement this module was making the switch from Ruby/RoR to JS/jQuery.  I was worried that picking up a second language would be difficult but it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.  This has given me a lot of confidence moving forward into my tech career.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
My biggest struggle in Module 4 was learning React.  There wasn't as much time spent on teaching React to us so that made it a little more difficult - I tried to implement it on my capstone project but became frustrated and eventually decided to use plain JS and jQuery instead.  The one thing I learned from this struggle is that sometimes you just need to roll back your expectations. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I felt that Module 4 was challenging for me because of external factors and as a result I did not perform as well as I would have liked to.  

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Module 4 was an eyeopener for me because it was my first exposure to a front-end framework.  I don't know if this has changed my job plans post Turing as I still prefer backend but I will definitely make time to learn a front-end framework(React) so that I can present myself as a well rounded candidate for potential job openings. 

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
The most important lesson that I've learned at Turing is that perserverance and community can take you a long way.  When I made the decision to return to college a few years ago, I never would have imagined that I would be starting a career in software development in 2018.  It has been a long and difficult journey and there have been times that I have felt defeated but I know that with hard work and help from my community that I can learn anything.  I will carry this new found optimism forward into my career and I hope that I will be able to help others in the tech community like I have been helped.
