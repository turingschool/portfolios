# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to get an intuitive understanding of Ruby so that I could get a clear understanding of what was going on under the hood. Also to get better at using other platforms that I would be using regularly in development such as atom, terminal, github, ruby-docs etc.

I feel I was partially succesfully in getting the intuitive understanding I was after. I have a good idea of how things work, but it just isn't fluid yet, the thought process is clunky. On the other hand I feel I was quite succesful in getting better at using other platforms I would need to use daily in this field.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with getting used to the Turing schedule. Balancing my time properly was a challenge; I would get tunnel vision on either homework or projects which would cause me to fall behind on the other. I learned to develop a schedule that would better accomidate my workload.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed all of the projects, I found it fun to take an idea on paper and turn it into a functioning program. 

My favorite project though was Enigma, I really liked all the pieces that went into make the encrpytor and seeing them all work to output a encrypted message.

Least favorite was between date night and event reporter, date night just made me feel out of my league and I was hoping to not feel that way for another week at least. However I learned a lot and made it through the project. Event reporter was rough for many reasons, but I was particullary frustrated with getting that project off the ground and going. I did like it as a lead up to black thursday though.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned to reach out faster (no more than 1 hour of struggle), it helps you learn something, introduces you to new members of the community, saves you lots of time, and helps you along with your project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Spend the first day right. A good dtr, going over the project specs, and coming up with a good roadmap before jumping in.


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Growth Mindset was my favorite gear up. The mindset keeps me going through the tough times. It make seem difficult at the moment, but that's because I don't fully get it yet, maybe I need to study more or in a different manner- but if I keep after it I will get it. 

I liked all of the gear-ups, but if I had to pick one I'd have to say 'Getting better at difficult things', and I only say that because of the timing, I think it would have been more useful earlier.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
Participating in the turing held events, demo night, wellness lunches, yoga, guest speakers.
Created a channel for the 1710 cohort to communicate and share networking information (linkedIn, github, slack, etc) with each other. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to be a resource for the incoming cohort, I also want to be a helpful member of mod I am in as well and to be a part of more community events.
