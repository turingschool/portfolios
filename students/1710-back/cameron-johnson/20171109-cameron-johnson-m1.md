## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My goal this module was pretty simple. I entered with a goal of learning as much as I possibly could.
There were times when I could have dug a little deeper than I did, but I chose to
try to learn as much as I could about everything we covered over digging all the
way into one subject.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I had a hard time getting the hang of enumerables. After some pairing with mentors
they became more clear. The main thing I'm struggling with now is working with hashes.
From the struggle I've had I have learned to not get discouraged. There are so
many resources online to help understand something you're confused about and
there are also lots of students who have struggled with the same thing and who
more than happy to share their knowledge!

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project in this module is probably the Black Thursday project.
I really enjoy working in pairs to develop code and this project is helping
me to learn a lot working with hashes and enumerables.

My least favorite project this module was enigma. I wasn't very advanced working
with CSV files and enumerables. This made this project fundamentally more
difficult for me to understand and get together.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

How to struggle! By that I mean how to react when I get stuck in code. I learned
to try to push through the struggle for about a half hour or so while reading
documentation sources before reaching out to another student or mentor. I have
also learned a lot about getting set up to start a project. This part of my routine
usually involves a lot of pen and paper drawings of diagrams illustrating the
way I plan on building my relationships between classes and other pieces in the
project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I have learned the real benefits of working in groups to develop code. The
differences in productivity between one person working on code versus even just
two was shocking to me. I have really come to appreciate the value of having
an extra set of eyes to catch that typo, or another brain to break apart some
of the logic of the projects. I have also learned to effectively break apart
the workload of a project and split responsibilities between group members.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite gear up session was the first one: growth mindset. This gear up was
intriguing to me because it encouraged me to change my thought patterns about
things I found difficult before. What I learned to think instead of "I'm just not
good at this," is "I'm not good at this YET." This idea really changed the way I
tackle a problem when I start to find myself discouraged from a struggle. This
give me a positive outlook that enables and also encourages me to push forward,
to try to learn more, and to work toward that hypothetical "yet." I find that
concept truly empowering.

My least favorite gear up this module was probably the Dealing With Difference:
Introverts and Extroverts. The gear up itself wasn't flawed. I identified myself
as an introvert and was paired with other introverts. Perfect, right? I would
have thought so, but I found that even in this small group I still felt excluded
and like my ideas weren't worth writing down (most of my suggestions were ignored!).
I found it frustrating which led to me not getting the full experience the gear
up was designed for.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I contributed to Turing these last six weeks by being fully invested in the program.
By this I mean that I actively participate in group conversations, try to
contribute during lessons and am overall easily approachable to my classmates
and any other student who has a question or anything else. I have organized and
led study groups outside of school as well. Anything I can do to learn more about
programming and extend my network, I try to do.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

One thing I wish I had participated in more are the community events. I did join
the queerqoders but we've only had one meeting. I would really like to join in
the Code Fair next module. I did have a lot of fun checking out everyone else's
projects and I would really like to be able to share my own ideas to engage
other students the way I was during the Code Fair.
