# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I came into Turing wanting to learn a new way of thinking and to also have a new challange in my life. Also I find it quite magical how much you can do and how much of a positive impact on the world you can make with programing. Well to say the least, I am found that challenge. Towards the beginning of the mod I was having an extremely hard time. Not to say I'm near where I want to be or should be. But I believe I have learned alot and have been moving in the right direction. I plan on repeating because I feel like its just starting to sink in. Which on week six is a little to late. Also I don't want to barely make it by and not get all the way through projects. Thats why i believe me repeating. The knowledge will be so much more valuable to me.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Honestly the hardest part for me was at first wrapping my head around the abstract thinking that is required in programing. I am now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and the concepts are starting to be etched into my head. I think at first I was making it harder on my self then was necessary. At times when I have sat down with my teachers and they would explain a concept to me. I realized that I was trying to run around the block ten times. When in reality I only needed to run around 1/2 of the block. 

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My first project that I really enjoyed was the linked list. I really enjoyed that project due to the challange of at first trying to wrap my head around the concept of what was actually happening. Then once it clicked and I saw how it functioned. Alot of the fog that was drifting around my head started to blow away and through the little holes of fog i caught a glimpse of how this was working and how some programs work in general. That facination is what brought me here in the first place.
  
  I also really enjoyed my last project mastermind. I really had a blast with this one. One reason is because alot of the concepts I finnaly started to understand and it didnt feel as much as a brick wall at every single turn as the previous projects. Also I really enjoys that I was able to add some .png art and ascii banners to make it feel a little more me. I was also able to get all the way through the project and into the extra credit with my knowledge that I have accumulated thus far.
  
  I would say my least favorite would be event reporter. Reason being is because at the time of the project I was having a really hard time with the scope of classes and how to work with csv files. Which as you can imagine didn't make the project easy at all. But I took it as a challange and pushed ahead. Did I make it out of the swamp? Not really, but I still considered it a great learning experience.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned how to be able to figure out large, seemingly insurmountable problems and break them down into more digestible pieces. From those pieces, I then tried to complete each one individually and then piece them back together into the whole picture. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I really enjoyed the paired project that we had. A take away from that project was being able to come to a problem with Cameron and we each have a differnent idea of how to tackle it. But then commbining both of our ideas and making something that was better than the individual ideas. I also learned how to be able to work on a project better remotely with a partner and being able to stay on the same level of communication and not stray to far from the original plan we made for our selfs. At times me and Cameron had a really hard time on the project but we didn't let that stop us. We just kept pushing forward and tried to soak up as much knowledge as possiable at every road block.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite would be when Megan Smith came and talked to us. I found that so inspirational. What she has accomplished in her life and how much good she has been able to give back through technology is truly inspiring. People like herself is another reason im at Turing at the moment. I have seen how powerful and world changing tech can be. That is something I want to use my knowledge for when the day comes that I graduate Turing. I truly want to give back to the world and try to make it a better place for me and my fellow living beings that share this rock that we call earth.
  
  I truly did't have a least favorite gear up. All of them I felt I walked away with knowledge that I didn't have sitting down. Which goes back to another reason why I think Turing is such a great school. You offer so much more then teaching someone how to become a programmer. You give them knowledge and confidence that you can do it no matter how far off the summit seems looking up from the base of the mountian and I thank you all for that.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  Upon looking back I truly wish I would have contributed more. I guess the reason I havent really given back more is because most of this mod I have felt like i was drowing and for me personally when your picture of self (no pun intended) and this idea coming in that I will breaze through this, is shattered. I think I barely have enough time to study much less give back to the community here. Which isnt true at all when I reflect back on these weeks at turing. It was more so just me being overwelmed and telling myself that I didnt have time.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I plan on repeating this mod. So come mod 1 again I have a better understanding of alot of the ideas. But trust me I know I still have a long ways to go. Something I can and want to do is to help out fellow classmates come mod 1 again. I want to be able to help out with the concepts that I do understand. Because I know all to well what some of my future mod 1 mates are going to be going through. I at least want to be able to reach out a hand so they know. They are not all alone floating free in this vast sea of knowledge at Turing.
