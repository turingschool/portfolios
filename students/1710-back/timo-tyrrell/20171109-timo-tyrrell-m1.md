## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to pass the module and become incredibly comfortable with the concepts
of ruby. I intended to be a strong partner and a resource for my fellow classmates
I was much more successful this module compared to last module. I was successful!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with the monotony of repeating, watching my former cohort mates move
on to more challenging and exciting projects, and I struggled with the feeling that
I should be learning more than I was. I reached out to many mentors for advice on how
to deal with repeating, and I was humbled by completing some of their recommended work.
I struggled to pair on the first project, but learned how to be patient and how to
teach or explain basic concepts.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Enigma. I loved the history behind the project and it was the first time I felt
completely confident in what I was building. Least favorite was event reporter
because of the difficulty in being able to test the project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to reach out for help when I was stuck. I learned how to manage my time
and break a problem into specific components.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to communicate more effectively and how to practicex patience. I also
learned much more about git workflow strategies.

## Community

Blockchain put on by mod 4. Great conversation on how this new technology will impact
our lives and how we can best implement it.
