# (Timo Tyrrell) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to become a professional developer this mod. I intended to put together a professional resume and a professional
presence online. I intended to enter the job-search hungry and ready for employment. I hoped to impact the community in
a positive way as a leader. I hoped to help provide leadership and encoragement to my cohort mates. I wanted to learn and master
the new skills presented in Mod 3. These were my goals, and I worked hard to achieve them.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed after refactoring and having about an hour or so to implement all the features I did not get to


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I dropped the ball on individual projects. This personal project was by far the most exciting of the mod. Unfortunately,
I had to prioritize my financial situation and the job-hunt ahead of the personal project this week. I have a final interview
tomorrow for Crownpeak that I feel good about and I made all my bills by today (Mar 1st), but the project was not finished because
of this. I will complete it by next week if given the option.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We did pretty well on group projects this mod. I had fantastic teammates and the timing of the projects allowed for my full
attention and hard work.

#### Le Pivot

#### Rails Engine

### Gear Up

The most effective gear-ups this mod were the job-search gear up and the resume review gear-up. These both provided
incredible strategies and insights into how we can achieve our ultimate goal of getting a job in tech. The job-search 
gear up helped me prioritize my time and and organize my search. The resume review helped me hone in on the important 
highlights and get rid of the fluff. It helped me get to the point I am now where getting an interview is not nearly
as hard as it was. Jobtrack.io is a great way to stay up on the job-search and I will be updating this regularly moving
forward - unless I get the job tomorrow!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I gave a lightning talk on community for the school that I worked incredibly hard on with Ellen Mary. I was SAB for my cohort. I'm 
volunteering over the break at a high-school with other members of Turing
