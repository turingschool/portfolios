## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to become better in paired settings and learn as much as possible about building web applications. I also
intended to become more comfortable learning new material and utilizing outside resources to facilitate learning.
I was scuccessful with all of this. I feel much more comfortable learning new material than I did in Mod 1. I learned
how to use my strengths to help drive progress in a group setting, and I can get a web application off the ground and functioning within a few hours. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The number one thing I struggled with was styling. I learned that ignoring something never leads to progress and diving in even when it feel tedious is always necessary. I learned to enjoy styling by the little shop project, because of help from other students and doing the styling with the inspect/developer tools style sheets to see the page respond immmediately

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Favorite Project was Bike Share because I enjoyed working with and learning from a great pair and finally building something outside the terminal and text-editor. Least favorite was job-tracker because I struggled so much on my own and did not yet have the skills to build a quality application

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to utilize mentors and outside resources to help me learn on the fly. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned to take full advantage of your teammates as resources for learning. I learned how to manage a large project via waffle and how to be very specific with branch names and PR's.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

Jobs from Blogs. It helped me organize my thoughts for my own blog post, and it allowed me to recognize that one of my personal passions ––writing–– should be utilized to achieve my ultimate goal in attending this program. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Helped run productivity lunch and paried with mod-1 and mod-2 students. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
