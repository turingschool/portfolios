## Biggest Achievement of Mod 4
Completing 5 of the assessment challenges when on 3 were required.
* Why? I didn't know where I stood in the class or in general, so it helped boost my confidence.


## Biggest Struggle
Navigating communication issues
* When you’re both saying the same thing
* When your partner isn’t listening to you (or to your client)
  * It can be tempting to view such situations as stemming from sexism, but I try to just own the issue as much as I can.
    * What can I do to better explain myself? What could I have done better?

## What I learned from the Communication Struggle
* I’ve learned that I’m really driven and serious.
* I take my education and work seriously and need to find a place of employment where they want someone who’s serious and dedicated.
* I still don't have solid skills or confidence to interact with people who I find difficult to work with. I am pursuing this in different ways.

## What I’ve done in 6 weeks that sets me apart
I’ve given this program everything I've got.

#### I have pushed myself in every way to work as hard as I can.
* As a woman
* As a person of the LGBTQ community
* As a person living with a disability
* ...and have had soooo many computer problems on top of it all!
#### I know that I have Grit. I am tenacious.

## How did FE stuff impact what I want to do after Turing?
* I’ve seen a lot of job openings for Full Stack developers, and I feel more confident applying for these positions now that I have a bit of Front End experience
* I like Design and I’m interested in learning more FE tools

## How did FE stuff reframe things I learned in Mods 1-3?
The strict organization of files in Rails vs Wild West of JS:
* I like the standard organization of Rails because it’s easier to navigate
* I like the  freedom of JS to do things on a page that don’t follow Rails conventions.

I found ways to combine these elements in my mobile-version of PYT Dating in order to optimize the logical flow and reduce confusion for the user.

## The most important lesson or skill
...that I will take to my new life
* I am strong
* I am driven ( I like the thrill of achievement )
* I know what quality work looks like and I like producing quality work.
...and that means some people won’t like me.




## Thanks!
