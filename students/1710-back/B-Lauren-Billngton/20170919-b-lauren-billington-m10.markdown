## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* I set out to learn how to code in Ruby and to pass the Mod. I'm not sure if I'll pass. I think I have a decent understanding of Ruby but I can tell that I'm not as fast as other students in many areas.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I struggled with not knowing how to get help when I needed help. I also struggled with feeling like I didn't have enough time to repeat homework or projects - partly due to learning and partly due to personal emotional challenges that seemed to take up a lot of time.  I am not sure what I've learned from these. Even if I pass the mod, I will need to think about and find solutions of how I can get through the other mods with the personal challenges I have.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* I liked the braille project and Black Thursday. I liked that I got to come up with the code for the braille-to-text, and I felt really confident at the end. I have enjoyed getting to work on some methods in Black Thursday which I found challenging and interesting, like returning the day of the week of top sales(or whatever it was). I don't know that there were any that were a "least favorite" -- it wasn't that I didn't like some projects, but that there were some projects that I felt confused about and struggled getting the help I needed to understand and move forward.  


What did you learn from your independent projects?
* I learned that I over think things and get too abstract when I'm on my own. I tend to think things are more difficult than they are and waste a ton of time either reinventing methods that already exist, or thinking that something is just more difficult than it is.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* That I like having a person that I know I can ask when I have questions. But what that really means is that I need to find ways to get more help instead of waiting until someone is forced to help me.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* I think I liked the session on getting better at difficult things. The takehome from the video and articles is that to learn things quickly, you need to be exposed to tons of perfect examples in order to let your brain pick up on the nuances. I think that Turing could take advantage of this more -- I feel like I just spend a lot of time looking at my crappy code, and that the examples I come across when searching for answers to specific questions are often short and sometimes written in non-rubyistic ways. It would be great to include several weekly examples of good rubyistic code that demonstrate things that we are learning about that week.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I brought cake once. I tried to encourage others. I felt really excited about getting involved with the Joane Clark society, but it wasn't meeting at times that were good for me. I also wanted to try and get involved with the LGBT community here (even trying to spark conversation in the slack channels) but it doesn't really seem like there is much interest from other LBGT folks in creating more community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I'd like to help more with the Joan Clark society. I'd like to get survey results from as many Turing women as possible to see what it is that students need/want, and the different reasons they can't or don't attend JCS stuff.
