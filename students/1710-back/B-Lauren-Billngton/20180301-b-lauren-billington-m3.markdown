# Lauren Billington - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn all the things! My goal coming in, from taking time off, was to be able to jump in at the beginning and stay afloat. I feel like I learned a lot more than I anticipated :)

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/BLaurenB/fakehub) (Optional)**
I wanted to make sure that I finished this one strongly and understood the concepts. I also tried to work on styling.


> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/BLaurenB/hu)**
Hu used API calls and scraping to generate data that I could present to a user to help them see if their ideas may have merit.
I learned a ton, and really enjoyed this project. I had a lot of obstacles but I really want to keep workong on it.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/BLaurenB/Rails-Engine-API)**
Write Queries and an API!
This was a great project and I really enjoyed working with Lee.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/BLaurenB/Little-Shoppe)**
Making a multitenant application from a brownfield single tenant app.
It was great to work with Nico, but we felt very pressed for time. I would have loved to get to the more advanced tasks, but I was shouldering the majority of backend tasks.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://gist.github.com/BLaurenB/ccb3d6a5c095c56ab44b72b614a7c6fb)
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
I didn't realize this was a thing...I can write up a blog post that I have notes for - two actually. One is about how API's are like humans (you present a language, a set of values, ways to exchange information or exchange work).  The other was going to be a short post on how to use Faraday with a POST method where you need to send keys as params.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  Music posse met once and that was cool. I would like to have a posse where we do code challenges
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience> Not sure sine this time it didn't seem to work out.  I do like that it puts you in touch with a few more people.
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?> I'm not sure.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>
I've remained an honest, kind, helpful person. I don't contribute to gossip and I try to encourage people.
