## Areas of Emphasis
### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
Mod 2 Goals:
1. Know how to build each piece of a basic rails app
  * I know what needs to be done to CRUD out the app, and I've gotten a lot of practice since the mid-mod. I've put in a ton of hours this mod to keep up, and I'm feeling very comfortable with each piece, more so TDD now than ever before.
2. Learn the differences/benefits of each different SQL database that we use
  * I'm not sure how much we have touched on this one, but I do feel like I know SQL well. Always up for more tutorials on that though.
3. Establish a method for building rails apps and keeping track of everything
  * I have embraced TDD from much of what my mentor has been working on me with. How to make a simple one, how to make a more complex one, before :each, let!, etc. I feel most comfortable doing CRUD that way, and I think it helps me build better structures. I also like to diagram a lot more than I did earlier in the mod and reference that diagram often. Wireframes are super helpful too.


### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I know that Turing in general will be a struggle for me, so I'm trying to just keep feeling comfortable with struggling. I had been out of school for ten years, and nothing in my life has ever been this difficult before. I really didn't understand RSpec errors in particular, but I've learned a ton from them at this point.
I keep learning from the struggle every day, and I know that all of this will pay off in a matter of months. I keep working towards Molly's birthday in May, and I hope to have a job by then. Keeping my eye on the horizon is helping me battle through the fatigue I feel each day.

## Projects
### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorites - Little shop and Idea Box. I like them for very different reasons - I could really get creative with Idea Box, and it felt like the first project that was truly mine, the way I wanted to do it. Even though I was disappointed in my score, I learned a ton by just working through issues on my own. Little shop is great because my team is fantastic. They went with my idea for the shop, and ever since I've felt like a true partner in this group, instead of "the girl" <<< which is how I feel sometimes at Turing.

Least Favorite - Job Tracker. It just wasn't that interesting to me. But the routes and learning those were cool.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?
I CAN DO THIS. That was what I learned. I'm capable of actually completing something in Rails without outside assistance and I can make it look they way I want too. Its the holy grail for me, getting to work on my own and truly surprising myself.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?
My voice is valuable. Something that Dione said way back in Mod1 Round1 was that I should voice my opinions more, because they matter. That meant a lot to me because she knows how loud I am, and to hear that from a friend meant that I wasn't speaking up as much as she knows I can. I think I've succeeded in that this mod, and it has helped me understand more and teach more at the same time.

## Community
### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite - Johari Window was interesting because I didn't know how others felt about me, and how much those feelings can line up.
Least Favorite - Outreach and Networking. I'm just older and it feels like these gear ups are taylored to 22 year olds sometimes.

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I lead my Posse and the Imposters Lunch and attend JCS every week. I hope I was helpful to those who attended Imposters, and I'm looking to branch out with it next mod with more helpful sessions and structure. I think my Posse had a good time this mod. I want to bring in more mentors to chat with next mod too. I really want to lead my Movie Club posse though so I hope that still happens.

### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I want to do more support for Mod1 throughout the mod. I know we have a tendency to slack off during the end of the Mod, so I hope I can be more consistent.
