# Katy Welyczko - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to be able to devote as many hours to this module as I have in the past, and I have fallen short. I know that to be successful at 
Turing I need to do that, and I focused too much on networking and job prep. 
That being said, I feel that I am strong with calling APIs now, it just took some extra work after the mid-mod to make that click. I want to 
do this over again and really rock it this time.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* I think I enjoyed this project the most even though I was not very successful at it. I do wish it had been mandatory so that I would have put in a bit more effort. I hope to do this one much better the next time. 

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I am still hoping that this will be a demo night winner. I'm playing to my strengths as a pm with also a developers perspective of this Google Home device and how we can better utilize it in the workplace. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Honestly, I hated both of these group projects. This one made me furious because I wasn't able to get help from my partner, he insisted that a rake task and seeding were doing the same thing, and he didn't test his methods. I tried my best to get what I could done on my own, but I could have used way more pairing in this project. 

> **[Le Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* The Pivot, while super helpful in getting us job ready, wasn't great. I have a hard time not being able to make styling decisions, I like to work as a team, and I think we all just fell short here. I wanted to make it more than it was, but I was guilty of letting it slide too. I liked fixing the bugs very much, but a lot of the new features took longer than I expected to implement, and it was really stressing everyone out.

## C. **Gear Ups**

>* [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)
I think that the best thing to do to avoid microagressions is to active listen and shut up. You're not able to understand how someone else is feeling if you are talking over their feelings about a situation. Just listen to others and don't keep those to yourself, if you're on the other side of it. 

>* [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
This session didn't motivate me. I know that there is an issue with gentrifying, especially in Denver, but maybe this gear-up didn't rightly show how we can fix this as programmers. I had a good discussion with my group about being advocates for women and minorities within and outside of Turing. Beyond that, I'm not sure what the takeaway was. 

>* [Whats your flavor of shit sandwich?](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_6.md)
Erika and Emily did a great job of explaining how different workplace structures are different. I enjoyed the talk that we had, just that the guest speakers went a bit long. I would have liked to hear from Erika and Emily more. 

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
> I lead two JCS meetings this mod. 

#### **Posse**
> I lead my Armstrong Posse and I'm doing all I can to keep us together at this point. The interest posses tried to knock us down but I still get about four or five members coming every week. We pick up lost people too along the way. 

#### **Playing a Part**
> I did a pairing with some Mod1 ladies who were going through their first projects. Other than that, most of my efforts have been outside of Turing networking and connecting people I know with students looking for work.
