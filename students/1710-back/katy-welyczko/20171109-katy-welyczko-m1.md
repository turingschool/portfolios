# Katy Welyczko - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  Really taking the time to understand the material while we were covering it in class and coming up with thoughtful questions. The first time around I just had no idea what was going on, so it was much easier to grasp this time. Taking this mod over again was one of the hardest things I've had to handle so far, but I'm so glad I did it.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Working with a pair was surprisingly hard as that was my favorite part of the last inning. I always just want to move at my own pace now and I don't feel like I can do that. I need to work on more communication and I need to get out of my bubble a bit more. Its not like my personality at all to be that way, but I feel like as a repeater, I've had more pressure on me than before and I just have to perform well. Thats been stressful.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I actually loved Enigma. It was really cool and I wish we could have finished. Thats one that I might go back to if I ever get the time.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I liked working on Event Reporter because a REPL is always fun.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Just working more with a group where I take more of a leadership role has been a challenge. I was the driver and my partner was mostly the navigator last time.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
The "Toxic Masculinity" gear up was my favorite. The Mod4s who led it were great and I think about this issue a lot as I'm about to dive into a male-heavy field and I've never been in this situation before. Its good to come up with some coping strategies and to try to understand life for those to deal with this toxic attitude.
"Getting Better at Difficult Things" was my least favorite because I just don't have a "lens" that I communicate through. There are a lot of facets that I live my life through, so I'm not sure about the questions that were posed.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I lead Imposters on Wednesdays, and that has helped me get to know more Mod1 students even though it seems that attendance is down. I'm going to try more direct outreach next inning.
I also attend most JCS meetups and I lead my Armstrong posse so I've had a lot of fun inside and out of my cohort.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
More Imposters talks and doing a spike or a lightning talk in front of the school. I need to get better with public speaking and I'd love to do the Code Fair.
