What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I was really happy with my final project this module. I have always been keen to learn about mobile development and it was exciting to see that the concepts I had picked up at Turing were readily applicable to the world of app development. It was really exciting to see that if you have the concepts down code is just code no matter the language or framework you are using to accomplish a certain task. 



What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Getting JavaScript down early on in the module proved challenging. I had grown very comfortable with ruby and found some of the methodology behind JavaScript strange and cluttered at first. However, with time I begun to see the similarities between the two languages and my skills grew. Balancing school work with the job hunt was also challenging and I feel this is something unique to module four that I had to deal with.



What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

For me the best thing about Turing is the community, its why I chose this Bootcamp over the countless others in the country. This module I have aimed to be a resource to those struggling in lower modules. When I started out, upper mods helped me get to where I am now. I just want to do the same to those that are starting out their journey in web development. Sometimes this can distract me from my own work, but its something that is important to me so I continue to do it. 



How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Before coming to Turing I knew I would naturally gravitate towards the front-end. With a background in UI/UX, it naturally sparks my interest. I chose the backend programme as it was something I struggled with a lot more and knew I would need the Turing community to get through. Overall I have really enjoyed learning both and I feel my knowledge of the back end will only help me even if after Turing I choose to focus predominantly on front end technologies. 



What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?


Before Turing I would shy away from things that I did not know how to do. I liked my comfort zone and knew what tasks I could achieve and in roughly what time frame. At work I often dreaded being given something that I did not know how to do. Turing has really changed this. While I still have a quick burst of panic when I am given something unusual. I now am able to take a step back, break it apart, come up with a plan of attack and get the job done in time for the deadline.
