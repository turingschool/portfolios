## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

A strong foundation in Ruby. I wanted to know more than just syntax but learn how to write clean easily accessible code that was adaptable to change. I also wanted to learn the 'big picture' stuff i.e. what makes ruby special/frustrating, why OOP, what problems does it solve for the community etc. Before the module I had written some VBA at work to automate various routine processes but I knew I had picked up some bad habits. Going into Turing I wanted to be mindful of this and make a conscious effort to 'iron' these out. I knew Turing was going to push me out of my comfort zone but I wanted to get better being comfortable when things get uncomfortable.

Another goal I set for myself this module was integrating into the Turing community. Being an international student this was really important for me. I knew I was going to be spending a lot of time at Turing so I wanted to make it feel like home. I was keen to talk to as many people as possible from all parts of the school and get involved in multiple extra activities.
 
In terms of success I feel my code has become easier to read and the bad habits I picked up before (bad indentation, cryptic variable names etc.) are starting to fade by the wayside. There is of course more work to be done but it is exciting to see these improvements coming to fruition. In terms of integrating into the Turing community I feel this has been on the whole successful. I have really enjoyed getting to know people from different cohorts and love all the extra activities on offer at Turing (especially yoga!). There are now almost too many people to say hi to when I walk down the corridor!



What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

TDD was difficult for me to get my head around. I did not even know it was something developers did before coming to Turing and it took me while to get used to the thought process. I also struggled with the sheer amount of material that was thrown at us over the first module. In my past I have always liked to take my time with learning new concepts and because 'typical’ schools tend to move slowly I have been afforded this opportunity. At Turing it was clear I would not have the same amount of time to let things sink in and needed to change my learning style.  

By struggling with TDD and spending time going over it with my mentor I learnt how important the concept is, especially when working on a production level code base. By learning about the 'bigger picture' of TDD I saw how valuable it is, as without tests a developer can be too scared to make any changes to their code. In terms of struggling with the pace of Turing I realized that you can often learn the most if you shut your laptop during class and really listen to what is being said. Write down what is crucially important and do so in your own words so you are really sure the concept makes sense to you. 


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Enigma. I loved so many things about this project. Firstly, it was paired which made everything more fun and exciting as I got to bounce ideas of someone else. I really think I have allot more enjoyment with code when I get to write it with someone else. Its always so interesting to see how their thought pattern differs to mine and how they would have implemented something. Secondly it was great to be working on something that was an integral part of my countries history. Had it not been for that code I would likely be typing this in German! The real world application of the project and the history behind it really put this project on top for me. 

Event Reporter. I struggled with this project. Testing was difficult as at the time I was not really aware of fixtures. I also found building something within a REPL confusing to get my head around. During this week I had family come to visit so I was frustrated as I was not able to spend the time on the project that I would have liked to. Nevertheless, I learnt allot from the struggle and the feedback was really valuable. Next time I will be sure to plan effectively when I have more outside commitments in order to maximize my time spent on a project. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned how to just 'start' on a project. I know that sounds strange, but often the hardest thing for me is starting. When I go through a project spec I can sometimes become overwhelmed, so many things to consider, so many edge cases that need to be factored in etc. This panic can often at times freeze my progress. After some time working on independent projects I learnt not to worry and to just start somewhere. I now find as long as you just start somewhere the project spec requirements will gradually begin to fall into place. 

I also learnt when and most importantly how to ask for help. Working alone it is often easier to get stuck on something for an extended period of time. I set a rule with myself where after 30 mins of trying something with no result I would ask an upper mod for help. This proved helpful in creating progress but with time I realized that when asking for help you have to be careful. Some upper mods are better at leading you to an answer than others. I always learn so much more when I am lead to an answer and not just shown how to make a test pass. I am now careful of who I ask for help as I know just receiving an answer will not help me in the long run. 


What did you learn from your paired projects?

From the paired projects I learnt how to effectively get my thoughts across to someone else. I really improved my ability to communicate ideas over a white board. Maybe its because of my background in design but I feel much more comfortable explaining my thought process when I am able to draw it out for someone else. 

Additionally, I learnt how important it is to read the project spec fully and not just dive into creating a solution. During Enigma I was so excited to start working on the project I missed a crucial piece of information about how the classes should be designed and lost my team unnecessary marks. Even at school not reading the question properly was a problem I had. It seems to have traversed into coding and I need to be careful to watch this going forward. 


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

Learning to tell your story: I really enjoyed learning about the life stories of my classmates. One of my favorite things about Turing is how everyone comes from such different backgrounds but are all striving for the same goal. This gear up allowed me to reflect on how interesting the Turing community is and allowed me to form a deeper connection with many of my classmates. 

To be honest I don’t really have a least favorite I have enjoyed all of them so far. For me the one I would slightly critique is the gear up on working styles. At one point in the session we were asked to identify as either introvert or extrovert. These traits clearly exist along a spectrum and this was talked about. However, the fact that this spectrum is dynamic and can change given certain situations was not mentioned as much. I personally think this is important to talk about. You can take a very extrovert person and put them in a situation where they will become introverted. Understanding this dynamic can often shed insight on how people label themselves as either introvert or extrovert. 
  


How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I had a wonderful time as a SAB this module. I worked on some great events for the Turing community (code fair, fall festival etc.) and we have many more in the pipeline (Homecoming!). As a rep for my cohort I have always tried to listen to my classmate’s suggestions and concerns. Retro gets more interesting every time and the discussions we have at the end on interesting topics seem to have everyone engaged. 

I always try to support the community in whatever way I can. From putting left out mugs in the washer to helping my classmates understand something that they may be struggling with. The Turing community is really important to me and was the reason I chose to come here over the countless other Bootcamps in the country. Its always so great to see everyone at Brothers on a Thursday blowing of steam after projects have been handed in and its so great to see strong bonds being formed this early on.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Give the module 1 students as much help as I was given during this module. But I want to be careful with how I give them help. Focus on leading them to the answer rather than just telling them how to do something so a test will pass. I also can't wait to be on the planning committee for the homecoming, the group has some great ideas and I think it will be an awesome event. 

I would also enjoy representing my class as the SAB again (if they will have me!). I don’t know if you are allowed to do it twice?
 
On a side note: my yoga is definitely improving whilst at Turing so it would be great to lead a class next module!
