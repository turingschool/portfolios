# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

This module I really wanted to understand the big picture of how the web works and be able to build a rails app from start to end. I was really keen to build projects that had a strong UX/UI to them. I wanted to fuse a lot of the design thinking I had picked up in my past and see how this would translate into the apps I was going to build. It was lots of fun creating applications a user could interact with in the browser and this made module two a lot more exciting for me compared to module one. 

In terms of success I think I have learnt a lot this module. I have a clear understanding of the fundamentals behind HTTP, cookies and sessions. These topics were totally foreign going into this module but I now feel confident explaining them to someone else. I also can work myself around a rails application and although I occasionally get stuck on something I can normally work through it with google at hand. I am really pleased with how my projects have turned out this module and I think the strong focus on design will mean I have a portfolio that stands out when it comes to the eventual job search. 


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think this module I struggled with how much new stuff there was to get in your head. Last module there was lot too but it was more just about getting ruby down. In this module I feel like there was a much wider pool of knowledge you needed to learn with lots of new syntax. Keeping all this information in your head at any one time was hard. 

I learnt that you just need to get comfortable being uncomfortable, even though it may not make sense to you the first time, with practice and repetition it eventually starts to set in. I learnt the importance of always writing things out, often I would copy and paste tests that were similar but only needed a slight change to find that later I was not sure of the exact syntax. By always typing things out even if it at first seemed tedious, I was able to commit a lot of the new syntax to memory. 


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I really enjoyed Job Tracker. It was our first look into how rails worked and it was really fun to build an entire app from start to finish. I felt like I really understood everything that was going on in the app and the spec was clear and easy to work from. I also loved styling it in a ‘dashboard theme’ and when I pushed it live to Heroku it was like oh wow now I feel like a developer. 

Bike share was also super fun to work on. Yeah I prefer rails to Sinatra but it was still really cool to have all that data to play around with. My team was great and we had a really fun time working together. This was the first time I worked through a group project together as a team and although it took longer to complete as we weren’t able to divide and conquer I learnt loads. 


What did you learn from your independent projects?

From Job Tracker I really learnt how to CRUD resources and how associations work between a database. I started to use the schema designer at this point and it was so helpful when building out the application. I now always use it before diving into a rails project and am practically always toggling to it to check what I have access to at any given point in time. I also learnt a lot about how to style rails helper methods in this project. Learning how to assign a classes to things in rails that don’t look like typically html allowed me to build out a project I was proud of. 

From Crypto-box I learnt how the basics of authentication and authorization worked. This project also really cleared up nested routes for me and name spacing. Before the project I had a basic understanding of why you would nest a route but after this project everything became a lot clearer. 


What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learnt how to navigate atom a lot better. Often during Ping-Pong pairing sessions with my team I would have to jump on some else’s computer and show them something. Few of the cohort use VS code so my shortcuts in atom have definitely improved as a result of this. But I still love VS code so not thinking of changing any time soon!

I also learnt a lot about the different working styles of my cohort. Getting to work with new people I had to adjust to different working dynamics which is always both exciting and challenging. I also learnt a lot about GIT during the paired projects. I always feel this is something you are able to practice when working in a larger group of people. My workflow definitely improved and the whole architecture behind version control started to make a lot more sense to me. 


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I honestly enjoyed all the Gear Up sessions this module. The one on the attention economy was really interesting for me in particular. In my last job a huge amount of time was spent by my team, trying to make users stay on the page or come back to our platform later in the day. I think it was a really interesting topic to discuss at Turing. As developers we may have moral objections to building applications that purposely distract users from their life but often corporate targets mandate this. You can often find yourself at a crossroads where you are asked to design a feature you personally think will do more ‘harm’ than good.


How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I continued to represent my cohort as SAB officer. We had some really good retro and discussed a wide range of topics ranging from net neutrality to the recent decommissioning of large denomination notes in India. This module I helped to bring the new suggestions box to the kitchen and worked to ensure the new cleaning regime was adopted. I also got to work with the planning organizers of the winter festival, although we maybe ordered a little bit too much hot chocolate I think it was enjoyed by the community overall. Its sad that I wont get to be an officer next module but it has been a lot of fun representing my cohort mates! 

I have also reached out to module one back enders in particular. I know when I started Turing the module above me was super helpful so I really wanted to repay the favor. Working with the cohort below was actually really helpful to cement my knowledge of ruby, especially as we don’t get all that much ruby practice time in module two. 


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Next module I really want to start the internal mentor database. I think it is really nice to know a little bit about someone before you approach them as a potential mentor. It can make the working relationship much smoother and if you find someone who has a similar set of interests as you that first meeting is just a little less awkward. Currently we have this system in place when approaching alums as potential mentors, but wouldn’t it be great if students in module one could look at a database of currently enrolled students to find potential mentors in an upper module that they have something in common with. It’s a work in progress for now and may be something I decide to build out as my personal project in the next module!
