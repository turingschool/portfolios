# \<Nico Lewis> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I wanted to build on everything I had learnt in module two and gain a deeper understanding of Rails. In particular, I wanted to improve my use of active record queries and finally learn what an API actually was. I knew professional development would be particularly important during this module and I was keen to lay a solid foundation early on for the job search. This was the first module where I was no longer a SAB so I was keen to still stay heavily involved with the community at Turing. Above all I wanted to get comfortable with unfamiliar concepts. To be able to carefully read documentation and delve into the unknown. Overall I think I accomplished my goals and I learnt a ton in the process.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

This module I really feel like I grew as a developer, but I still feel like there is still so much more to learn. The more I learn about different concepts the more I begin to understand which parts of tech I naturally gravitate towards. I am now starting to have a much clearer idea of the type of role I would like to shoot for after Turing.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
This project had us consume the GIthub API and implement Omni Auth. SRP was stressed throughout with specific service objects dealing with the JSON retrieval. Effectively we were required to make a clone of the GIthub profile page so front end technologies were important.  

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

I learnt a ton during this project and was able to spend some valuable time with my mentor drawing out the entire handshaking process on the whiteboard. It really made me realize that I am a visual learner and that pen and paper is really best before I pick up a keyboard. I felt a big sense of freedom with this project and it made me feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from them along the way. Things definitely started out shaky at first (don’t they always at Turing) but once I got into the flow I felt much more comfortable consuming APIs

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>
Artegee. A marketplace to allow local artists to showcase their work. No price tags. No buy it now buttons. Users must instead build a relationship with the artist and negotiate a price that works for both. 

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I really enjoyed working on this project. In my past life I had designed the wireframes already for this platform so it was really exciting to be at a stage where I could make them come to life. This project really tied up all the loose ends I had with rails and I was really pleased with how the front end looked. There is so much more I would like to add to the application, and I am sure I will continue to work on it in the future. 


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
In this project we created our own API to serve formatted JSON to a client. It involved many complex active record queries and introduced us to serializes. 

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
Working with Anna on this project was great. We would book out study rooms and whiteboard the advanced active record techniques out. This was worlds apart from how I used to do active record (hop in the console and just hope something came back that looked helpful). By having a plan of attack laid out in front of us it was so much easier to actually write the code and by the end of it we were effectively making the queries on the fly. 

This project really opened my eyes up to another side of software development. Before this project I had no idea what an API actually was. It was really exciting to be working with something I had heard so much about when walking the corridors of Turing

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>
This was a brownfield project that had us take a typical e-commerce site and turn it into a multi-tenancy application. We were required to implement a host of new features that required us to get very familiar with documentation.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was the hardest project I have tackled whilst at Turing but it was such a rewarding experience. My team was smaller than the rest so we had to really hustle to get things moving and meet deadlines in time. This project really changes the way I look at a code base. Now instead of just trying to get something to work I start to think about developer empathy, flexibility and detailed code reviews when trying to implement a feature.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md](Microagressions)
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

This was such a great session. Sal led it so well and I think he was the perfect instructor to take it. I had some really good conversations with my classmates and I feel we all became much closer by the end of it. I now feel like I have a much better understanding of what a microagression is and what to do when I am around one. 

> [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown](Tradgedy of The Commons)

This was a really interesting session and I was able to have a really good conversation with some people from Turing I don’t normally get to talk with. We spoke at length about divisions between society are at an all time high and how this flow tends to change over time. We also spoke about affirmative action and how this could perhaps lead to greater levels of imposter syndrome within the work place. Overall I feel the Parable of the Polygons exercise was a great way to begin a dialogue about a topic that is difficult to talk about. 



## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

I was no longer a SAB this module so I wanted to make an extra active effort to involve myself with the Turing community. I helped to pair with a module 2 student and it was great to see that I still remembered the things I had picked up in module 2. I also became much more involved in the wider Turing calendar and attended some great talks and went to some really exciting Meetups in the area. In particular, ‘intro to accessibility’ which is a topic I continue to find myself interested in.  
I also took a much more active role in my posse this module. We now have a lot more people from junior modules so during our study hall time I would always shut my laptop and circulate around to try and help the others that were stuck on something. 


#### **Posse**

Our posse continued to be great this module. We had a wide range of events from ‘how to tell your story’ to asking a panel of mentors questions about how they found the industry. We also found time for some general socializing outside in the sunshine. I would have really liked to be in charge of the posse next module!


#### **Playing a Part**

I always try to help out my fellow classmates when they are struggling with something and try not to work with my headphones on so people fell that they can easily approach me with a question. I am also currently looking into giving my lightening talk on the UI/UX of forms at the next Denver UX Happy Hour meet up.
