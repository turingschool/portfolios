## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?  
* In this module, I hoped to learn:
* to code in ruby to a level sufficient to pass to Mod 2.  
* I also hoped to:
* make solid relationships based on our shared interest in coding and tech,  envisioning a long-term community of which I could be a member.

What did you struggle most with this module?  
* The first half of the mod, I struggled extremely with anxiety.  Some consequences of the anxiety led to additional struggle in terms of my professional communication and  learning success.

What did you learn from that struggle?
* I learned, through the structured support of the PIP process, very effective techniques to address the stress that was impairing my enjoyment of the learning opportunities Turing was offering.
* The PIP also taught strategies for addressing/avoiding instances of unprofessional communication.
* From the Professional Development classes and the Wellness Lunches, I learned some critical pieces of information about myself and critical techniques that allowed me to fully embrace the goals in the PIP.
* I learned that I can manage my stress, which I have fundamentally doubted for years.
During the PIP, I was able to identify some specific remedies that are transferrable to my future: eliminating caffeine at this altitude, because the caffeine mimicked some stress symptoms; practicing midfulness; keeping my husband in the information loop, rather than trying to protect him; taking more full ownership of my own learning.

What was the hardest?
* The first two-three weeks were by far the hardest, though they did not need to be.  My not having done the pre-work more than once was a mistake.  Not having worked beyond the pre-work was a mistake.  
* Most important for myself, during that two-three weeks, was the "stress".  

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* The Black Thurday is by far my favorite because my stress is under new management and I do really like the premise of the challenge.  I am the most engaged in this project as a coding-contributor, and I am actively learning, which is amazingly gratifying having recently thought that I could never be a contributor or learner.

* The first projects would just have to share the status of least favorite, though they are all good projects, because I could not achieve the learning that was intended. It was a time of laying the foundation for the PIP intervention, so I cannot regret them.   

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* This is hard to answer, since I am not sure exactly what learning occurred where.  I do think there is the side-effect of the stress that my memory of the first 2-3 weeks is not very good.  So parsing out specific code-learning would be hard.  
* I found the mentoring of upper mods, mentors, and sometimes fellow students to be really generous and helpful.  The absence of judgement, even when it was clear that my mind was not fully functioning, was so kind.  So learning that there were resources for me, even at my most bleak mind-set was a lifeline during the first projects.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* My first paired project was learning very specifically how a well-executed project can be tackled.  Examples include: 1. seeing pry implemented to help create tests.  2. Seeing tests drive development.  I also learned that I should pay more heed when someone is explaining to me, particularly by avoiding interrupting.
* During my second paired project, I used the PIP and the DTR to help structure our approach and to enhance our learning.  I formed a good working relationship with my partner.  We both really like coding and take a different approach, so learning from the differences was gratifying.    

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Why?
* The one that really helped me the most, so therefore my favorite, was the one about Introvert or Extrovert.  It helped me specifically think through some of the PIP stress management. I learned I am an extreme introvert, that I really need my buddy, who is my husband.  Hugely beneficial!!

What was your least favorite? Why?
* Honestly, I did not have a least favorite.  Each and every one was well thought out.  I am sorry to have nothing to offer for this question.  Honestly, my most important learning this mod was about managing my stress and being self-reflective. The Gear Up sessions played a very constructive role in helping me in my learning.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I offered to be (and did serve as) designated driver on Thursdays after Brothers, though I did not go there, myself.  
* I offered a really good encouragement for the Black Thursday project, which was to watch the video that Mike posted on the calendar.  
* I did dishes in the dishwasher.  
* I cleaned microwaves.  
* I put a "care bag" for our mod in the classroom.  
* I encouraged my fellow students to persevere.  
* I made tea and french presses for others.  
* If not the smartest worker, I did set an example of dedication by arriving most days by 6:00 and leaving 7:00-8:00.
* Even to students who are coding above me, I occasionally had a chance to share a tip with them, which I gladly did.
* Offered support to a friend who suffered a terrible bereavement

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to contribute by
* being a positive presence for everyone who interacts with me
* being a respectful listener
* by being an example of learning in the face of challenges
* by setting an excellent example of managing stress
* by supporting the learning of my cohort
* by expressing more appreciation to the instructors and others
* by expressing more appreciation for the opportunities Turing brings me/us
