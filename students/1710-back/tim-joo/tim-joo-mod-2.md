# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to accomplish a very solid foundation in building web applications in rails. I believe that I am successful in achieving that goal.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Executing a joins table. I learned how to set one up but it took a couple of projects and diagnostics before I got really comfortable with using a joins table outside of testing files.

Compiled vs Scripting Langauges

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite project is IdeaBox. It was independent, I had to learn how to use a gem by myself with documentation online.

Least favorite project: Ideabox. Carrierwave configuration for heroku was a mess, especially with AWS configuration.


What did you learn from your independent projects?
Things finally started to click for me this module.


What did you learn from your paired projects?
I hope that I learned from my feedback from Bikeshare with my partners in Littleshop. Bikeshare we mostly did everything together, and littleshop was developed with people splitting off pretty frequency so it was a learning experience having to develop on both workflows.


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite gear up was Growth Mindset because it was nice to learn from some of my original cohort members.

Least favorite probably had to do with the cold outreach professional development stuff. I have alot of experience in that due to my experience in corporate marketing.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I helped some of my fellow cohort members with some additional tutoring.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Contribute to open source projects.
