# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  To challenge myself to become a better me. I haven't been in school for a long
time nor have I had jobs that were mentally stimulating enough to be happy in them
so I decided to jump right into Turing and while I haven't become as proficient
in coding as I would have hoped by now. I've been growing a lot personally
and working very hard to prove to myself that I have a chance at this. I don't
know exactly what it will take yet but I feel that I'm getting closer daily.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I've been struggling to keep up. My learning style means that it takes awhile
for things to sink in and I've learned to take better notes. I've learned not
to take project criticism as hard and rather try to grow from it than just
beat myself up over it. I've learned that even if at the end of the day Turing
is too intense of a program, I won't give up and thats something that can never
be taken away.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  Enigma was a lot of fun because I could actually conceptualize the project well
  and liked the result of our work. It was the exercise that really drove
  what object oriented programming is for me.


  Perilous Journey was my least favorite because the node concept tripped me up.
it was also difficult to do the Event Reporter with less time being able to
work because of an event back home that I had to go to (brothers wedding) and
I was very stressed out trying to juggle school responsibilities and family
expectations. With the extra time I'm still not sure if I would have been able
to finish because again, I know I'm pretty behind but I'm trying really hard to
wrap my head around everything. Its a difficult program for sure but I'm glad
I'm going for it.


What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to read error messages better and learned a whole lot about
resiliance.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  That I at least have good communication skills and project management skills.
I also really like doing the driver/pilot style. One because GitHub can get
pretty cumbersome when you are new to it, and two because I feel like even if
I lack in programming skills I'm a really fast typist and know my shortcuts.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite was watching the Debugging the gender gap video and discussing womens
roles in CS, past present and future. As a straight white male it helped me understand
my privilege and think about what I can do to help others who don't have as much
privilege

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I made a lot of really good friends in the short time this module was. I love our
cohort and if I don't make it I'll miss them a lot but I know that they are right
here and we'll still be friends no matter what. I really like the Turing community
and I hope to be a part of it even outside of Turing when I finish the program.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I feel that I'll still be in Module 1 so I want to be there for anyone struggling
and be able to give them the help they need in the most easily understood terms
while still educating them about the lingo used in computer programming and guiding
them w/o giving them the answers to questions they may have.
