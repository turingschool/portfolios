# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out out to redeem myself for repeating my last term in module 1. I wanted to
fill in all the gaps that I needed to fill to make things clear.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with confidence maybe. Even though everyone else saw my improvement
between last mod and this one, I kept doubting myself and getting in my own head
about failing again. This mod and even during the break I've been hard on myself
and paranoid that I haven't improved enough to over come the expectation of me.
Reflecting on it all I learned the constant feeling of "walking on eggshells" may
have helped me push harder to get to the level I am at now.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Enigma was my favorite. It was fun breaking down the code and implementing all
the pieces in to tests and code. The story behind the enigma code and finding out
who Alan Turing was and how much of a hero he was, made me really excited to jump
on this project and pretend to do the same.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned better way to approach projects and how to break things down on
whiteboards to the smallest form to get a better picture of what is going
to be done.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to be more vocal with others, and not be shy about my ideas, tips,
and tricks.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite gear up was the gender gap movie gear up, because I learned something
new and opened my eyes to things we all may overlook at times.
My least favorite was the extrovert/introvert gear up, because I didn't enjoy
splitting ourselves apart and labeling ourselves on a spectrum. but I'm positive
theres a reason why we did it, even if it isn't in the directly.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I contributed to the Turing community by participating in productivity and
imposters lunches. I also extend out to the new mod 1 students during
and after class with what they are working on and how to get out of problems
they're on. g

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to help organize a lunch group.
