# \<Gabriel-Afflitto> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  This module I set out to become familiar with API functionality at a high and a low level.
  I set out to really come into my own as a developer and be able to really prove to myself and my instructors that I am a capable developer and have the necessary skills to perform on the job.
  I also set out to challenge myself more and be able to teach myself things that are not always taught in class

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 2 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2.5 |

  I feel like maybe I could have done a little more in regards to the professional development and overall community participation, but all my energy this module was directed towards the technical
  side of things.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

 **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
  This project was my first true exposure to API consumption. It consisted of consuming
  the github API and recreate the user profile page.

  At first, this project seemed very daunting and for the first few days of the project,
  I was not able to wrap my head around the project and conceptualize what had to be done and how.
  It was not until the last two days with it that I was finally able to get how API integration was working and how different endpoints give us different information and using that to retrieve
  the information. I learned so much with this project

 **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
 What I chose to create with my self directed project was an application that allowed a user to view song lyrics using an external API. Apart from lyrics, a user would have access to general information about an artist and be able to save favorite songs and artist to their database.

 I had a great time working on this project. I feel like me Heroku workflow has improved tremendously because of it; as with my understanding of the asset pipeline. I liked being
  exposed to more APIs and get a picture of what some limitations certain APIs have, while cementing my knowledge and getting more practice with Oauth and general request/response cycle


## B: Group Work & Projects

 **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
Rales engine was our first module 3 project and our first exposure to API creation

This project went well for us as far as team dynamic. Kelly and I really worked well together and I learned a lot about serializers and custom routing, as well as more exposure to complex SQL and ActiveRecord

 **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
Le Pivot was our first brownfield project and it was among 4 people over a two week span

The team dynamic went well on this project. It was a very long and I really feel like I came out of that project a better developer because of it. This project was a test of group interactions in a potentially stressful setting. This was a very helpful project and also made me have a greater appreciation for project management tools such as the Pivotal Tracker and wireframing in general.

## C. **Gear Ups**

I thought the mod 4 directed gear ups were pretty good. I attended the ethics in AI gear up and I liked the conversation we had regarding it.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I paired more than 3 times

#### **Posse**
  Posses kind of broke up halfway through the module so I mostly used the time as study time with
  other classmates
#### **Playing a Part**

Offered some advice to struggling students in lower modules as well as pairing
