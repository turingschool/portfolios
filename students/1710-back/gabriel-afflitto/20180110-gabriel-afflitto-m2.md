# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  In this module, I set out to be able to learn how to create basic web apps using frameworks. I set out to make sure I kept up with the pace of the class and understand things like the MVC, HTTP verbs and database functionality as they were being taught. I set out to come into my own as a developer and learn from my mistakes in module 1, and become a better version of myself. I set out to improve my git workflow, I also made it a goal for myself to make TDD a top priority in throughout this entire mod. I believe I was successful in this module and met my own personal goals.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled the most with styling in this module. I did not anticipate styling to be that difficult coming into module two, but it was. I learned that styling is very important from a UX perspective and that I shouldn't write it off. I will improve.
## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

My blog post is about ActiveRecord vs. DataMapper. It is very similar to my lightning talk but more in depth.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite projects in this module were Little Shop and Idea Box. I like being exposed to authentication/ authorization and being able to deploy a project to Heroku. I've had lots of fun building apps with Rails. As for Little Shop, I'm working with a great team and I like the whole cart exploration concept.

  I wouldn't say I had a least favorite project, but maybe BikeShare, only because Rails is much more convenient that Sinatra. Also, even though it's been very challenging, I did enjoy working on the Analytics on both Bike Share and Little Shop

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I got a much deeper understanding of one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. I also got a much better understanding and appreciation of TDD as I made it a point to have tests drive my development even if it meant I would take longer and not complete a project. But I did finish, so that was great.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  From my paired projects, I got a MUCH better understanding of git workflow and how branches can really prevent merge conflicts. Also, during Little Shop, one of my teammates has really helped me with ActiveRecord/SQL querying so that is awesome.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  The attention economy was my favorite gear up, it was very relevant to what we do here and it literally affects everyone in the country at this point, since there are many shady practices by companies. Like marketing smartphones to little kids etc.

  My least favorite was the feedback gear up. I feel like we have had enough lessons on feedback and it's something most of us have down at this point.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I offered pairing and advice to multiple module 1 students, since I struggled through module 1 I wanted to make sure their experience was better than mine.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to potentially give a lightning talk, maybe participate in the code fair, and always offer pairing to lower modules. Also networking is something I want to do.
