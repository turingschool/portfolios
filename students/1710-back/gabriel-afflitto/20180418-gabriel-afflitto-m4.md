# 1708 Portfolio Updates

## Learning Goals

* Gain comfort speaking about and defending their work and code using correct technical vocabulary
* Practice speaking in front of a group
* Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about themselves and their work


## Requirements

* Students will prepare a markdown document and submit a pull request to the Turing Portfolios Repository using the template provided (more detail below under ***Submittal***).
* Students will also prepare a 10-12 minute slide presentation to give to a panel of 3-4 reviewers.

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?  
  My biggest achievement of this module was the fact that I was able to pick up a new language in a  
  
  short amount of time. I really feel like I was able to take the key concepts I learned from each of the previous modules,  
  
  not to mention the ability to google and do research; the fact that I know which questions to ask when I'm lost. Another
  
  huge achievement was that I was able to stay focused and finish strong despite being here for as long as I have.  
  
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?  
  The capstone was definitely the biggest struggle for me. Having to plan out and scope a project for about three weeks  
  
  completely unfettered, whith minimal checkins AND having to work with completely new technologies; having to teach myself  
  
  with minimal guidance. As far as building a project, I learned to really refer to project management tools, always have a   
  
  plan b when it comes to the creation of a product as to have the best MVP possible, having to scope down depending on the   
  
  feasability of what you plan to build. As far learning a new technology, I learned to sometimes take a step back and make   
  
  sure you really know how the inner workngs of a technology works before implementing it and basically shooting in the dark.  
  It's ok to take a few hours and do some tutorials and read some blog posts; it will pay off in the long run. Roll with the 
  
  punches, have patience.  
  
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?  

  What sets me apart from my peers is that I have a relentless work ethic. I will not stop working until I am satisfied with 
  
  the progress, in terms of content learned or actual production. On many occasions I have been the first one in and last  
  
  one out at Turing. I told myself at the beginning of this journey that I would not give up no matter what, and I'm keeping 
  
  to it. I have a lot of people depending on my success, the most important being my year old daughter; so I have a constant     
  reminder of why I'm doing this and who I'm doing this for. It's very real for me and I feel incredibly lucky  
  
  that I have found something I love to do that also will lead me and my fam to a better life. My life experiences before and 
  
  even during Turing really put things into perspective and ensure that I will attempt to be my personal best at what I do.
  
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

  I really took a liking to JavaScript and an interest in other fontend technologies such as Firebase. Compared to all that we 
  
  did in Rails, it felt like we only got a small taste of JavaScript and it has left me wanting more, I plan on practicing 
  
  more JS and would also like to get a much deeper foundation and understanding of Node.js and Express.js. I would definitely 
  
  be open to finding a job in either backend or frontend JavaScript. Well it's a bit of a reality check in terms of all the 
  
  conventions that Rails has, then moving to something like JavaScript and React, which are both so unopinionated in terms of 
  
  structure and passing data.
  
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
  I cannot pick one specific thing that is most valuable that Turing has taught me, instead I have many. Turing has taught me  
  to roll with the punches. Before Turing, I was someone who didn't enjoy struggling much with anything and was not one to 
  
  keep at something if I wasn't good at it. Patience is another lesson that Turing taught me. To have the patience to sit down  
  with something and get a deeper understanding, then try to implement. To learn, all I need is to have the patience to   
  
  realize that rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will a project.
#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1708-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
