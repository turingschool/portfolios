# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
This module I set out to really grasp core programming concepts and logic. I think made a
a lot of headway in that pursuit. I've been pushed to my mental limit in many ways, and it's
taught me a lot about myself and where I need to improve.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with stress management and the demands of school. I struggled with the need to deliver clean, readable code quickly. If I have the luxury of time I can produce something really great, but having to produce great things quickly has been very difficult. I've learned that staying at school until 1:30am probably doesn't make sense. I've learned to listen to
myself. I've learned that testing, file structure, variable name and readability are as important if not more important than what the code does.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite project was probably Event Reporter. I enjoyed connecting a lot of different
tools together, I liked working with ERB and CSV files. I liked building my own REPL. It
gave me the opportunity to taste some different parts of programming.

Least favorite project was probably Black thursday. Not because of the concept or project itself really, more because of the circumstances. I would like to do this project and focus on it outside of needing to prepare for the Pantahalon. It's a beast, and I know if I had more time I'd be able to really do something awesome with it, but the size of this project has put a lot of stress on me. Pairing has also been a real challenge, I don't feel like there is very much balance in regards to output between the two of us and it makes me feel like I have to do it all by myself. I do my best to split things off and give my partner tasks that are crucial but she does not have the technical skills to do what is asked in the spec, and that just adds to the stress. I see the learning opportunities in this and I've gained a lot from this partnership, but it has definitely been a challenge.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I've learned how to recognize and temper my desire to just go and build code. I've learned to reach out for help when I need it. The coding vortex coding can by strong when I'm working
by myself I have a tendency go on without food or rest. I've been learning to take pomodoro breaks and step away from code when it's appropriate.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
People have very different working styles and abilities. I've learned that having stand-ups, retros and DTRs are crucial for successful paired projects. Also I recognize that I can learn
a lot from people who might not have the same technical abilities as me. Teaching has been really educational. Pairing allows me more opportunity for project reflection and goal realignment because there are two or more people questioning and criticizing the process

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

MY favorite was probably the timeline gear up. It was nice to pull back and look at my life
and how far I've come. Least, was probably the introvert/extrovert gear up. It seemed
somewhat simplistic and not really useful for me.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I'm a member of Pahlka and I also started a meditation group that meets every Wednesday.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
More yoga, more meditation, more Pahlka, I'd also like to DJ at a Turing party.
