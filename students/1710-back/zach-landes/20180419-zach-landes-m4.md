What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I was proud of my capstone project. I worked hard and I think I have another good project for my portfolio

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?


Working with a client who has no code background was probably the hardest struggle. I think I learned a lot from the experience. Mainly that two weeks is not enough to make a client happy, with anything really. I would approach this very differently in the future. I would start by downsizing the MVP dramatically so that the client has more realistic expectations.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I built an app that has a lot of functionality and seems shippable. It also looks good, in my opinion.


How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I learned that there is a lot to learn outside of the Ruby world. It inspired me to pursue other technologies and to understand how every language is diffrerent and suited to different needs. I also like front end.



What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?


I learned that you can do it, just don't get too overwhelmed and seek support when it's the right time.
