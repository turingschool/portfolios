>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* \<Notes>

I was a part of SAB and tried to get more music going at school. I worked really hard and I think I learned tons.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
  I decided to do my own project for this one and I'm glad I got to try out hitting
  a different api. It was fun and pretty laid back compared to things that happened there rest of the mod

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
Timo and I crushed this project and I really had a great time doing it

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

I really appreciate the ethos behind the gear ups, and while a handful of them are great
(debugging the gender gap, attention economy, and a few others I can't think of)
in general I find them routine and predictable. Like for the 'relax' gear up,
I really would have appreciated actually relaxing instead of the standard break-up-into-groups-and-discuss-what-relaxing-means-to-you thing. I really don't benefit to much from that.


## D: Community Participation


#### **Posse**
Posses were weird this mod. Music was fun and then it all kinda went to pieces

#### **Playing a Part**
SAB member and karaoke instagator
