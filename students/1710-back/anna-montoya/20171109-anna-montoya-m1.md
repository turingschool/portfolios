# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I began this module hoping for a strong understanding of object orientation and the Ruby language. I also wanted to gain experience in paired programming collaboration and become comfortable debugging. I feel that all paired programming opportunities were successful and I was pleased with the collaboration that took place this module. While there was a lot of exposure and growth in each of the areas, I didn't take command of the concepts with the amount of depth that I had hoped.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I also struggled breaking down problems down into finer elements. As the projects became more complex I struggled with understanding the way that objects communicate in each instance. I've recognized that breaking down problems and moving through steps one at a time, the objects become more well defined, the problem more manageable, and the solution more clear.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was Enigma because it was the first thing we built that I could connect with the function of the program. I also felt that collaborating was a valuable way to learn and approach the project strategically. I also really liked Flashcards because it was really pieced out and required a lot of class communication. Even though I like that REPL allows you to see more concretely the way the program is behaving, it was a little disruptive to my coding process, which was challenging.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

Independent projects forced me to be resourceful--to seek information through the internet, ruby-docs, mentors, etc.. This is when I got most experience debugging, too. Because they were complex projects, there was a lot of trial and error and it was necessary to test assumptions, and be able to isolate an issue and identify where it was occurring.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I felt working in pairs was really beneficial. Because clear and consistent communication is necessary, verbally describing each aspect of the project helped us break down the project and determine exactly what we needed to accomplish and brainstorm/determine strategies for getting there. Describing issues and strategies to one another reinforced the concepts we were learning in the process.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I found all Gear Ups valuable in that they helped me better define myself as a learner and inform the trajectory of time at Turing and my future career. My favorite Gear Up was the most recent when Mod4 students lead. It's inspiring to feel a part of a community of developers working toward a common goal, all at different stages in the program. It helped reveal how I can be impactful by making small commitments even while I'm a novice and also see the larger implications and opportunities to positively impact society as I progress as a developer.

While I found the "Getting Better at Difficult Things" Gear Up interesting, it was less enjoyable due to
personal timing. I was anxious to turn this "corner" and feel higher level concepts sink in and it was challenging to discuss something that was already consuming my mind. It was still valuable content, though it didn't sit terribly comfortably with me at the time.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I became a part of the Joan Clarke Society and participated in some health and wellness sessions to contribute
to shared experiences through peer engagement. I've been an active participant in each Gear Up, and developed strong bonds within and outside of my cohort. Both in paired programming and working along side one another on separate projects, I've fostered relationships that inspire learning and growth mindset. I've also created consistent connections with multiple mentors who are alumni, as well as made use of peers in upper modules as resources. I look forward to paying it forward with lower modules as I advance in the program.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

As my skills are developing, I look forward to being a resource to those who are new to Turing. Having been someone who felt a lack of confidence in the content the first time around at an accelerated pace, I'll be happy to offer support to those who are having difficulty with the content and also provide emotional support to those who are feeling less comfortable with the concepts. I recently joined the Pahlka Civic Tech group and look forward to opportunities to contribute to conversations, ideas, and projects that will have more broad social implications.
