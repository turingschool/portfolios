## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I set out to accomplish learning the basics of Rails and building dynamic web applications.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled most in the first two weeks of the Mod, since everything was so drastically different than the first Mod. This was not unexpected, as Mod 1 was similar until I was able to get a grasp on the basic concepts and build my more advanced knowledge from there. I've learned that I quite capable of learning these technologies and to try to not let it affect me when I am struggling. All it takes is one aha! moment to get it down. I also struggled during the Ruby challenge, which made me realize I need to continue to go back and do ruby challenges to keep that fresh in my mind.

## Blog

https://medium.com/@madsen.tyler/why-your-rails-images-are-broken-on-heroku-and-how-to-fix-them-be48e386b067

* I had trouble deploying my mini-project to Heroku do to image errors and fixed them using asset helpers, so I wrote a blog post about how to do that.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* The mini-project and little shop were my two favorite. I enjoyed having a little creative freedom to make something that we wanted and were not strictly following a set of guidelines. My least favorite was Bike Share. While it was a good learning experience and nice to get some time with Sinatra, I felt like some of the directions were unclear.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* From my independent projects, I learned how to push myself and sort through documentation to figure out gems and other Rails features that we were not taught in class.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* In group projects, I learned how to take a step back and allow others to take charge in areas of the projects.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite gear up was the Attention Economy. It was a really interesting topic and I enjoyed discussion how we can be both profitable and ethical as budding developers. I also enjoyed the storytelling gear up this mod. It was great to hear others stories in greater detail and also working on refining my own. My least favorite are the feedback gear ups. While I understand the value and that I can grow in my ability to provide feedback, they are too numerous and often seem forced.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I contributed some to Pahlka, but found it to be difficult to juggle along with school work and life.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* I would like to contribute by entering into the code fair/demo night, as well as building my network amongst other students and alumni.
