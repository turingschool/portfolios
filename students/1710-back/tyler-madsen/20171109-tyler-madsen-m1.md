# Tyler Madsen - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* This module I set out to become proficient in Ruby and build solid foundational backend programming skills that allow me to quickly learn new technologies/languages that I will undoubtedly encounter during a software engineering career. I believe I have been quite successful in accomplishing this goal. There is obviously more I have to learn, but for having only coded in Ruby for a couple months, I feel quite confident in my skills, as well as my ability to continue to grow and build upon what I have already learned.

* I also set out to build a community that will help me to achieve me goals and set myself up for getting a job post-Turing. While I feel like I have started building a solid network within the Turing student body and have joined a student group that I enjoy being a part of (Pahlka), I can work harder on building a better network of alumni and other mentors who are professionals in the industry. This is why I joined the "Cold Outreach" week 5 gear up, in order to develop the skills to do so further.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* Coding-wise, I struggled most with File I/O and ERB in realizing which data structures are output by those classes and their methods. I learned the importance of utilizing all resources that are available in order to figure them out. I also struggled with being overly controlling in choosing code/design decisions for my paired project. I learned to take a step back and realize that the collaboration aspect of the project is just as important as the code and completing overall functionality for the project.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite projects were Black Thursday and Enigma. I enjoyed Black Thursday because it is the most complex problem with the most moving parts that we were tasked with. Black Thursday also seems to be the most real-world relevant project we have done so far. I enjoyed Enigma simply because building an encryption machine was a fun task to accomplish.

* My least favorite projects were A Perilous Journey & Event Reporter. Though I understand it's usefulness for learning linked lists, which are a common interview question, linked lists seem like an outdated practice that the industry is holding onto for the sake of holding onto it. While I enjoyed Event Reporter for teaching me the basics of ERB and File I/O, I also disliked it simply because it is the project I struggled the most with.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned that I am capable of solving "complex" problems on my own and in a group. My past coding and logical/analytical experience shined through in my ability quickly understand and break down the problem at hand. I also learned that there is often an "Aha!" breakthrough moment when faced with a problem that almost always occurs, so I wouldn't let myself feel too down if I didn't understand something right away. I would either find help in solving the problem or move onto something else until I could.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I learned that paired programming is significantly different than independent programming. When it comes down to design decisions, everyone has their own opinion and it can be difficult to balance those varying opinions. I never worried about having to code entire projects by myself - yes, it may take more time out of my day, but I found the true challenging part is the collaborative decision making process.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite Gear Up was the Storying Telling session. It was great to begin hearing other classmates interesting stories about how they got to where they are at, why they joined Turing, and what their plans are afterward. In addition, working on and practicing telling my own story was helpful and will be helpful for when I am applying for jobs.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I contributed to the Turing community this module by joining Pahlka, a student group geared towards building applications and providing technological solutions to those in need who may not be able to afford to do so otherwise. As a start to help other Pahlka applications get off the ground, I am part of a group that is building an organizational tool, which the entire Pahlka group can use to manage their projects. I also contributed to the community by helping fellow classmates work through problems when they needed help and I was able to provide it.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* Next module I would like to continue my work in the Pahlka group. I would also like to reach out to more Alumni and mentors, in order to further build my professional network in Denver.
