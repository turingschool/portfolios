# Tyler Madsen - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn how to build and consume APIs, which I believe I have a solid fundamental understanding and ability to do so. I also wanted to learn how to use oauth and speed up projects.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**

APIcurious provided a good opportunity for sandbox time to learn how to consume an API and test with VCR & Webmock. It was also valuable for learning how to setup Oauth and refactor code in a professional manner.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**

I highly enjoyed the creativity and self direction of the solo project this mod. It was a challenge to consume multiple different APIs and weave the connections together into a coherent application.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

Rales Engine was a great project to begin learning how to build an API. I enjoyed using advanced ActiveRecord and SQL techniques in order to build a useful business intelligence API.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**

Working on a brownfield project was a completely new challenge that we had not had the opportunity to work on prior to this mod. Fixing and building upon someone else code is very challenging and I learned a lot in how I should build flexible tests in order to limit them from breaking when others are working with my code.

## C. **Gear Ups**

We had some good gear ups this mod. Our class had some great discussions around micro-aggressions, which should be ever present in our mind. My takeways are being more thoughtful about when I could be micro-aggressing or stepping in when I noticed someone else doing so. I also went to the Introvert to Influencer gear up, which my main takeaway was to talk about myself as if someone else was talking about me. I noticed a difference in how I talk about myself vs how I would like others to talk about me, and there shouldn't be a significant difference.

## D: Community Participation


#### **Posse**

My posse has spent time doing CodeWars and also mentoring the under-mods. In addition, I begun attending the Machine Learning posse to start developing those skills.

#### **Playing a Part**

I have contributed by pairing with mod 1 and mod 2 BE students and helping them with their projects.
