## My Story

I started my career in digital marketing where I held roles in both paid search advertising and search engine optimization (SEO), which is the earned side of search advertising. In the paid search role we had access to vast amounts of click data, which I learned SQL in order to query and pull subsets of that data. This allowed me to make all sorts of data analyses - time of day, day of week, geographic location, and pretty much anything under the sun to determine where to implement client budgets. I enjoyed writing SQL and developed some skill at it, but about a year into the role found the opportunity to switch to SEO. I wanted to do so, because I was interested in working more directly with clients websites, instead of working in AdWords, the Google platform for making keyword bids. In the SEO role I learned HTML, CSS, & JS on my own time, not only because I was interested in developing using these technologies on my own, but to be able to provide better analyses and recommendations for my clients. In the role I also brought over my learnings from the paid search role and spearheaded the databasing of SEO click data, teaching my co-workers HiveQL, which is similar to SQL.

I quickly realized that the software development aspect of each role I held was easily my favorite part and wanted to devote myself full time to pursuing a career in software development. This is what led me to Turing and is what Turing has provided me. I enjoyed both frontend and backend technologies, and still do to this day; I am excited to start my career in software development.

## What was your biggest achievement of the module?<br>

My biggest achievement of the module is building a fully functioning application in a completely new language and set of technologies that I hadn't touched previously. Having built a React Native application that I plan to use over the course of about three weeks proves to me that I am capable of figuring any new technology if I put my time and effort towards it. I have developed a process for learning and figuring out languages and technologies I do not know.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?<br>

Learning how to pass data and functions, particularly those that require user input was difficult to figure out using React Native. I learned how to pull state out to the highest common container/component that needs that state and pass it in using props. Passing callback functions is still very difficult. In the case of using some sort of form, you also need to set state in that component so that you can pass the user info into the callback function that was passed down. Some of this code can get pretty messy, but I think I could organize it better given a second opportunity.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?<br>

This inning, I believe I went above and beyond in choosing a project that was well outside my previously set bounds. Admittedly, I knew we could create the Dominion React Native app given enough time, but I was apprehensive about our ability to finish it on such a short time constraint. Not only were we new to JavaScript and React, but we went the extra mile diving into React Native, mobile development, and game development. We spent hours pouring over documentation, reviewing other games built with React Native, researching packages and other technologies we could use in development, planning our file organization and architecture, and then executing on that plan to build a fully functioning mobile app version of Dominion.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?<br>

I have always enjoyed frontend technologies and my experience working with them further this mod solidified my enjoyment in working with them. I found building both frontend and backend applications concurrently provided a great opportunity to change up what I was working on and declined burnout on the project. It provided a balance to the creative and logical parts of me that both have a desire to be fulfilled through software development. I did realize that I very much enjoy the defined structure and best-practices that a framework like Rails provides. React has flexibility, but I found myself at times unsure which direction was the best to go down without having previous experience in development. Having said that, I do feel as though I now have some determined opinions about React with a project under my belt.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?<br>

The most important thing I have taken away from my time at Turing is that the combination of a solid work ethic, learning process, and community can allow you to achieve anything you set out to do. My time at Turing is the hardest I have ever worked towards a goal, hard work which was justified in my acquisition of a job that I can't wait to start.
