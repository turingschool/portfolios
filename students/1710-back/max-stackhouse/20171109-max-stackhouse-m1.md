What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* Gain a solid understanding of ruby code and progress to an advanced intermediate level, yes I feel I was successful
* Learn ruby syntax and style conventions as well as OOP priciples, yes I was successful

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* Balancing living in Ft Collins with school and fitting into the community. I feel like I've made some good relationships with other students, so I am happy in that regard. My commute which I originally thought would be a complete struggle turned out to be one of my best times to get individual work done. I basically have 3 hours every day of built in study time.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* Binary Search tree & Sorting Suit were probably my favorite because of the complex algorithms used. I enjoy working out those complex problems and getting stumped, but then figuring out a solution.
* Black Friday was super fun, especially once the functionality was built we were able to focus on making the program faster. It was interesting to see how much of an affect core structural assumptions (Hash vs Array) had on the performance.
* Event Reporter was interesting because of how big the project was, but I feel like it is too similar to Black Friday. I would've loved to do battleship instead.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* Individual techniques to build programs. Ways to overcome my personal deficiencies such as rushing into problems without proper planning.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* Patience with a partner that is at a different spot in their learning.
* How to plan with a partner so that we can accomplish our goals.


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* Code: Debugging the Gender Gap. This topic has been a hot one lately in media and I've wanted to hear other peoples perspectives on the ideas. Also, the movie was a great way to see the perspective from women and what happen. It helped me relate with some of their feelings about feeling inadequate, because I've had them myself.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* Organized a few lunch-time group bike rides. Not a ton of participants but it has been a good way to get closer to classmates with similar interests.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* Continue to offer low-key exercise events to encourage others to come out.
