## Areas of Emphasis

My main goals for this module were to investigate more advanced patterns of rails development and learn what rails is like in a professional environment. Learn about advanced refactoring methods and how to architecture an application to improve performance. I felt like I was able to master the Rails basics and learn some of the tools that can be used to improve performance. I wasn't able to apply too many of the concepts outside of caching API calls / calculations, but I feel comfortable with the ideas and feel I could implement a solution if confronted with a problem.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I really enjoyed this module. There were a lot of interesting concepts being presented and I learn best when introduced to concepts and instructed to play with those ideas and apply them. The projects in this module were great and I especially enjoyed Le Pivot.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[BatteryWiz Repo](https://github.com/Maxscores/batterywiz)**
> **[BatteryWiz](https://batterywiz.herokuapp.com/)**
>* \<Description>
An application that allows a user to input their location and energy consumption by month. Then, it calculates what size of solar system you'll need to produce enough energy for the household every day of the year and the size of a battery you'll need to power the household throughout the night.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a very challenging project because in order to make these basic calculations I needed to manage many different models that all work together. Every Solar Installation has a production model, consumption model, battery, and solar array. Additionally, organizing the math while keeping the calculations fast enough for a web service was a challenge.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine Repo](https://github.com/Maxscores/rales_engine)**
> **[Rales Engine](https://rales-engine-1710.herokuapp.com/)**
>* \<Description>
Built an engine that serves business intelligence data at a variety of endpoints. Additionally built a jQuery landing page that serves as the documentation for the site.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
Enjoyed this project a lot. It basically confirmed that backend programming was what I want to do. I love building efficient structures and building a sales engine is exactly that. It was cool to build something that can be tapped into to build another page feels powerful. My favorite takeaway from this project is how easy it is to spin up an API in rails to use to serve data to the rest of the site. Combining the rails backend with some small jQuery features can really push a site over the edge.

> **[Le Pivot Repo](https://github.com/Maxscores/le_pivot)**
> **[Found Sound](https://found-sound.herokuapp.com/)**
>* \<Description>
Found Sound is a multitenancy ecommerce site that allows users to create stores and sell their books, records, instruments and musical equipment. My main features was the API and live chat functionality.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
Hands down my favorite project of the module. I think a big part of that was the team I had. We were all dedicated to the success of the project and wanted to make something great. I feel like the biggest takeaway was how difficult it is to manage a project and make the design decisions as a team. The group as a whole got excited about tackling the challenges presented to us and finding a solution as a team was fun.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>
My favorite gearup this mod was the Parable of the Polygons. The website we were sent to was interesting and I loved how the demo really showed the affect what would happen if everyone wanted to be near people like them, but not people that are different. Since then I've been thinking a lot about including others not like me in the groups around me.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
> I continued to lead my original posse every week, unfortunately the new posse rules kinda killed the posse, but we still had 4 or 5 people every week and we used it as a social time.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  We mostly just hungout and chat about life, turing and jobs. It was nice, we all wanted just a low key hangout time to unwind.
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  Meeting people from other mods that I wouldn't otherwise. I felt that the original posse format where we had randomly assigned student groups is awesome.
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>
  It has gotten me out of my immediate bubble of classmates
