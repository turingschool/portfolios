## Areas of Emphasis
### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
Mod 2 Goals:
1. Know how to build each piece of a basic rails app
  * Definitely successful here. Felt comfortable implementing whichever piece I need to in a rails app. Still working on establishing best practices for each piece. For example, still struggling a bit with making input forms intuitive to the user.
2. Learn the differences/benefits of each different SQL database that we use
  * We've really only used PostgreSQL and haven't spent much time learning about others in class.
3. Establish a method for building rails apps and keeping track of everything
  * I definitely live or die with the user stories. My process basically starts by reading what the stories I need to create are, then creating feature tests to cover those. When I go back to review the site I tend to only stick to user stories and sometimes rely too much on automated testing without much manual testing. Overall, I believe I was very successful in establishing a process that I feel works well. I felt my ability to plan & test before I code has been steadily improving.


### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

One struggle this module for me was staying engaged near the end of a project. I noticed on Job Tracker and Rails Mini Project, that by the end of the projects I wasn't giving my full effort. Not sure what exactly was the root cause of this, but it is something I want to be more conscious of next module.

Also, I can definitely feel that I'm overall getting more fatigued from the school schedule. I feel like these struggles are related and probably a little bit justified, but I can also take care of myself better.

## Projects
### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorites - Bike Share & Little Shop. These were my most favorite because they were group projects. I've really enjoyed the group projects this module, because it allows us a bit more freedom to work on the areas of the project that are personally interesting.

Least Favorite - Job Tracker. Kind of a frustrating project because of how it is framed. It isn't given much importance, so motivation is pretty low for it.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?
I can't rely on pure automated testing when building forms and tools for humans. Really need to test out functionality more in the browser rather than just relying on tests. Also, how easily I can get distracted on an open ended project without having a solid plan in place. Definitely need to work on getting a better plan together for my future Individual projects. Definitely need to work out a better plan if I try my own prompt again. Felt like that was a big part in my poor performance there.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?
Got a lot of practice with being very specific about what to work on. There are a lot of things that can be assumed and if teammates make a different one than you, you're going to be redoing parts. Also, learned how hard it is to break up pieces of a site before others have been implemented.


## Community
### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
The Community Gear Up about Open Source Ethics was interesting because we got to talk about ethical perspectives and think about each one from an ultimate philosophy method.

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
Helped Pair with a few Mod 1 students and my classmates. Also, contributed to a few Turing lessons/tutorials to fix typos. Built a rails challenge for my classmates.

### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Continue to help tutor other students. It is definitely hard to make the time with my commute, but there have been opportunities.
