# 1710 Grad Portfolio

## Requirements

* Students will also prepare a 10-12 minute slide presentation to give to a panel of 3-4 reviewers.

#### Questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
In mod 4, I felt like my biggest achievement was the capstone project. We were able to take a challenging and complex board game and turn it into a playable React-Native app. Neither of us had experience with React or React-Native, so that was a bit of a challenge. Overall, it was totally worth it. I felt like we learned a lot of new things, and most of them were how not to do things.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
The capstone project was definitely a struggle. Mostly because we were going in blind as far as structure/architecture goes and had to figure things out along the way. These struggles were hugely beneficial, because it showed me that when I'm jumping into a new technology there are going to be different ways to utilize the features of it. Even though I can 'build' an app using React-Native it probably isn't going to be structured as well as I can do with a Rails app. This is how learning on my own is going to be, just jump into it and try to figure out the best way to do things.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I chose a capstone project that I was excited about building and using, but also was challenging. Challenging problems and excitement for a finished product are what drive me to work hard, so having those both part of my final project definitely helped drive me to stay focused and engaged with school. Especially since I will be graduating with a job.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Mod 4 was interesting. It definitely didn't feel as challenging as Mod 3, which truely felt like the peak of the learning. However, it did show me that yes, I can learn new technologies on the job. One of the things I liked the most and will probably stick with me is contributing to open source projects. I really enjoyed adding onto the Refined Github browser extension and got a huge sense of accomplishment from doing it. It is a high profile project, so getting a contribution there is cool and I'd like to keep working on it. Ultimately, I loved working with JavaScript and will most likely be using that for side-projects because building chrome extensions and client side stuff is fun.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
That is much more fun to work on a team that is enthusiastic and excited about what their doing. I want to join teams that are like that and pursue projects that are being built for the right reasons.


#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1708-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
