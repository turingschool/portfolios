## Mod 4 Portoflio Summary

#### What was your biggest achievement of the module?  

*This module has tought me more about the necessity of "being comfortable being uncomfortable" than any previous module.  Ending module 3 and feeling prepared to work as a professional rails engineer had me feeling very accomplished and sure of myself.  Diving into completely new technologies like JS, React, Node and jQuery has driven home the reality of what it's going to take to expand my skills as a professional developer.  
 After becoming proficient in one technology it's easy to tell yourself "ok, now that I've done that, learning anything else is going to be a breeze." The reality is that it never gets 'easier', you only learn to be more comfrotable at doing difficult things. 

#### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?  
*The biggest struggle for me this module was learning React.  It wasn't the nitty gritty syntax that was challenging, but rather grasping the overall concepts about what React 'wants' from me.  Although I had learned this lesson several times over, I waited a very long time to close the computer and get the pen and paper out to illustrate the concepts.  Once I got around to doing this, everything began to click.  Moving forward this is going to be remain an invaluable tool for grapsing new concepts. 

#### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules? 
* Coming into module four, my career propspects were strictly limited to Rails Engineer. I had been exposed to Javascript a few times before, but had beein feeling that it's best to stick to what I know.  That I'll be more successful doing that. What module four tought me was unbridled confidence in running head on into a new technology. I recently applied for a Python position, and after a great phone interview was told though email that Python was a pre-requisite.  I contacted them assuring with a confidence that I've seldom felt before in my life and said that I can learn this and be successful at it in a matter of a few weeks. I've heard talk that the curriculum for mod 4 might be changing for back end students in the future, but I would stress the importance pushing students to learn new languages and frameworks.  It is incredibly empowering.

#### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job? 
* Turing's practice of making you get upand speak in front of a crowd is an immensely valuable skill. Especially to speak about topics you're not necessarily an expert in.  I can often feel that because I don't consider myself an 'expert' in something I have no business getting up and talking about it. Up until college I was very engaged in theatrical endeavors, and gradually left that begind as I grew older.  Turing has reinstilled a confidence in public speaking and I believe that is an invaluable skill in life for setting yourself apart from crowd.
