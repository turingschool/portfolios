## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- To attain a grasp of basic application building and database/ data relationship management.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- I struggled both with learning activerecord/ sql and getting a grasp on the much larger file directories that a rails application has.  The moment that it all clicked was glorious!  From this I learned the value of repitiion.  After going through blogger several times I came to a point where when I saw one step, I immediately knew the next few, until the whole process of creating MVC relationships clicked.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite project was definitely the Rails Mini (Gif Generator).  It was my favorite because I was very intimidated by APIs going into it and had avoided learning anything about them.  When we were presented with the three options for projects and gif-generator was labeled "spicy," I definitely felt like I was taking the plunge by selecting it.  This made succeeding at it that much more enjoyable, especially given that it was a solo project.

- My lease favorite project was Job Tracker.  Although I learned a lot from working through it, my CSS was very rough at the time.  I remember having put a few days into it and being proud that the functionality was there, but when I showed one of my friends the website it was very deflating.  Even after that I spent considerable time trying to style it, but the final product was an eye-sore.  This left me feeling like I wanted to completely forget about it.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I learned that despite the intimidation of a rails project, I can build an application from start to finish in only a few days.  This is a very empowering feeling and has me brainstorming for ideas of personal applications to build.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
- Although we were introduced to working models like Driver/ Navigator and TDD in module one, I had been very resistant to the ideas.  The paired projects in this module have tought me the value of co-designing a program and of using a test to set your expectations for functionality, then building the program to meet those expectations.  When confronted with a problem in "Little Shop" we were able to discuss amongst ourselves what the right strategy would be, often taking the best parts of all of our ideas to create a better solution than we could have come up with on our own. 

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
- The one I attended on "The Attention Economy."  If we had more time I think our group could have talked about that for hours.  There were so many things to consider like the ethics of big companies getting our attention, the value and quality of the information we are getting, and the where this current paradigm of media debauchery is headed.  It was a great way to spend an hour.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I attended a few imposters meetings and made more of an effort to spend more time with fellow students outside of Turing at  after school events like the Thursday group at Brothers and Oskar Blues.  I also assisted several mod 1 students with working through some of their assignments.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I'm very excited to do a lightning talk a the wrap up on 2/12.  I hope that afterwards this will lead to more one on one and group discussions on the topic of stoicism. I also hope that the principles I'm discussing will help students better handle the pressures of the curriculum here at Turing.  I'm also hoping to hold a meet up the first weekend that we are all out on our next break to go to loveland pass and ski.
