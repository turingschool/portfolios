## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

- My goal this module was to achieve a working understanding of the different
ruby data types and interaction patterns.  I envisioned building something by
the end of the module that would have rely on multiple classes and hierarchies to
handle, structure, and manipulate data as needed.  Taking a step back from the
technical aspects of this module, I hoped to raise the bar for my own standard
of sustained effort and self application.  My original idea of my personal limits
had more to do with continuing self motivation, while over the course of the
module I learned that the mental resources and energy play a huge role in my
development.  Budgeting my metal resources wisely is a skill I will continue to
practice.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

- I'm tempted to say it was the rigorous requirements and attention to detail
for the assignments, but over the course of the module I have grown to like
how toughly the work is graded here. My biggest struggles came from keeping up
with the multitude of assignments often happening all at once.  Coming into
class in the morning and realizing we had a homework assignment on the Google
calendar that I had overlooked or an assigned reading for a lesson that day
would throw me off kilter faster than anything else.  At the heart of that is
the sense of falling behind everyone else, and being left out.  The fast paced
learning environment here can bring the walls closing in on you fast if you
have missed a lesson or concept. What I have learned from being confronted with
these feelings several times over the course of this module is how to confront
uncertainty and self doubt and to push forward regardless of insecurities.  I
have learned the value of being scrappy and gained a deeper understanding of
the role my confidence plays when facing a challenge.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

-My favorite project this module was A Perilous Journey.  I valued this project
over the others mainly due to the fact that it was concise and succinct crash
course of how to confront and deal with problems.  Looking back, the overall
scope of the project wasn't anything that outstanding but it was the act of
facing a concept that initially seemed out of reach and over the course of a week
grasp and gain a working knowledge of.  Thanks to my father, I've always had an
affinity for most things "wild west" so I found the theme enjoyable too.

My least favorite project had to be the Event Reporter.  Mostly because the subject
matter was very dry and lackluster, however I understand the real world application
of building a database like that. I struggled more with that project and the
ERB HTML export than I have with most other concepts introduced to us this module.
However, I do believe this is where I made the greatest strides forward in
improving my ruby syntax and style and creating short methods that adhere to SRP.
Although I know I got a 2 in the syntax portion of that project due to one line
of experimental code which I had forgotten to remove from the night before being
over 80 characters, something definitive "clicked" during that project in terms
of building cleaner code.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?

- If I had to put my finger on one thing that my independent projects taught me,
it's how to ask for help.  Beginning this module I would say that is the one
thing I struggled with the most. I was always a loner throughout high school
and college and prided myself on learning to do things on my own.  It wasn't long
after the start of this program that I realized I would fail if I didn't reach
out and ask for guidance. Given what I have learned from hearing graduates
from Turing speak about life as a developer, it's an absolute certainty that
being successful and being a loner are mutually exclusive.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?

- In complete honesty I'll say that I had been anticipating the paired projects
much like you might anticipate an impending hail storm: you're pretty sure things
are about to get chaotic and there's not a whole lot you can do to stop it. Also
in complete honesty, my dread was misplaced.  My experiences pairing with Nicholas
and Cameron were far better than I would have guessed six weeks ago.  Once the
grounds for communication and expectations had been established during the DTR,
I found it was really easy to work and make collaborative progress with my
partners.  The value of the DTR cannot be oversold.  I don't mean the form itself
so much as I do sitting down and being upfront with your partner about what sort
of expectations each of you has and gauging each others working styles. It was
immensely helpful to work with another student in an intimate setting like that
and see what sort of things they do better than you, and how my style can be
improved. I'm looking forward to larger collaborative projects in the future.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite Gear Up was the Professional Identity session.  I really appreciated
getting sound professional advice on branding and finding employment as a full
fledged developer. It was a grounding reminder that my time at Turing will come
to an end and I will have to rejoin the workforce with a new skillset.  My least
favorite Gear Up session was the Feedback session.  While I valued the framework
for giving constructive feedback, I found the practice of dissecting examples
of feedback and attempting to categorize them pretty trivial.  The classes of
feedback were represented as being black and white, when in reality it's more
ambiguous and could be better represented as a vign diagram. I recognize this
is likely being taught to us as there have probably been issues with feedback
in the past, however I found most of it to be common sense.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I contributed to the Turing community by taking every opportunity to socialize
with other students inside and outside of the campus.  I made a strong effort
to engage in class discussions as well as assist other students with coding
work when needed. During paired discussions I made efforts to sit down and get
to know all students in and outside of our cohort.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- Next module I'm looking forward to refining my lightning talk presentation and
giving it to the whole school during a wrap up assembly. Additionally I am looking
forward to revamping my Posse, as by week four no one started showing up any
more.  I find great value in the posse get togethers as it's a great chance for
students from all modules and each program to socialize and gain insight into
what the Turing experience is like for all the students here.
