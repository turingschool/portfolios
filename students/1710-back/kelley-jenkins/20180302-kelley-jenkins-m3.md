# Kelley Jenkins - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> Coming into Mod3 I knew there was a lot about API's. I didn't really understand what an API was when I began this mod so my main goal was to understand API's, how to use them and how to build them. I wanted to recognize when I was getting things and give myself credit for my understanding. Another goal was to get my resume and professional development peices in order. It's something I struggle with so this was  a big one.

>* \ This was a tough mod and the toughness kind of came out of nowhere. I was feeling good in the early weeks but then there was a major shift in the middle of the mod. The dynamics seemed to have changed both as a class and individually and I definitely struggled to adjust.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>*  I enjoyed APICurious and thought it was a good exploration into consuming an API and getting the information you wanted returned. It was nice to explore at my own pace. My main takeaways from this project were getting comfortable with Faraday requests and parsing the response. In addition it was good to practice pulling out the request into a service, and pulling information from different parts of the api response was helpful for getting used to accessing information through hashes and arrays.  

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* Description: An app to connect formerly incarcerated individuals with employer who hire people with criminal records, and mentors willing to assist them in the job search and transition back into society. 
>* Takeaways, your experience: This was a really good reality check! My main takeaway form this experience is really just how much goes into building an app on your own. I was really excited about my project and a little bit disappointed by the progress I was able to make on it. I think it was also intersting to see how many different directions a project could go in once you get it started. It taught me how critical a really good plan of attack is and how much you need to really think through what you're making. In addition, I discovered how challenging it is to make an app realistic especially when relying on users to build the database. Technically I feel like my project could have used some more features, but I must recognize that this was my first forray into javascript with the google maps api and I spent many hours just trying to navigate that peice. I wish I could have taken it a little bit further. I would like to keep working on it and refacactor a lot of the if/else's that ended up in my views. To make this app m 

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Description: Building out an API based on existing CSV data where endpoints return JSON objects for a variety of categories along with business analytics.
>* Takeaways, your experience: Rails Engine was probably my favorite project of the mod. I really enjoy the sequel/activerecord and data analytics. I also had a really great experience with Gabe. We worked well together both put in a lot of effort which paid off in a successful project.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Description: Brownfield project that involved taking a single e-commerce shop and turining it into a multi_tenancy application, along with many other technical features. It was designed to be similar to the types of projects you might face on the job.
>* Takeaways, your experience: I found the Pivot quite challening. I struggled to find my place in the project and felt my confidence dip. The organization and planning component is usually something I really enjoy and value on projects however I found it hard to organize and plan in a way that made sense to both me and my teammates. I liked the multi-tenancy component and felt I understood the process for that part of the project along with the authorization/authentication component. It was cool to see Stripe implemented, although it was not my stretch goal I did rely on it to save credit cards. I wish I had learned more about the PORO and presenters that a member of my group worked on. I think that knowledge is really useful and would like to find time to really dig into presenters and decorators.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* Posse's were kind of a mess this module. I met with mine a couple of times but it was rare to get everyone together at once. I really enjoyed getting to know the upper mod students when I was in mods 1 and 2 but this mod especially has been a challenge. I find it nice to have a break from coding and talk with others in the school about their experience. I think there needs to be a bit more structure if they are going to be successful but at the same time it's nice to have a break from mandatory learning. 

#### **Playing a Part**

> I have tried to be more involved in community groups such as JCS and Imposters. I think I've done an okay job of this but honestly this was a very busy mod and I found myself at school till late in the evening most nights. It was sometimes hard to find the energy to also particiapte in the community.
