# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I knew Turing would be a huge adjustment in terms of life and learning. I knew it wouldn't be the same as previous academic endeavors, so I set out to adjust my learning as qucikly as possible in order to gain a firm understanding of the fundamentals of Ruby and OOP. I think it took a little bit longer then expected to adjust to the Turing style, but I'm happy with how it's turned out. I think the last two weeks I have really felt more comfortable with Ruby and OOP in general. I think overall I have been successfull in figuring out what works for me and I am happy with my understanding, though I recognize that there is always more! 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I definitely struggled with adjusting to the uncertainty of how I was doing in the program. The amount of information was overwhelming and I worried that I was not catching on as quickly as everyone else. I had a lot of emotions at one point and I had to really identify what was going on. I needed to mkae sure I took some time for myself and to breath. In the last few weeks I have made a conscious effort to do just that a couple of times a week and I've noticed it has helped significantly with my stress and allowed information to sink in mroe than it was previously. I have definitely picked up strategies to take into the next mod and I hope I can manage my time and the workload effectively. 

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I enjoyed Perilous Journey and Black Thursday the best. I felt like I was given enough information going into the projects to be able to get them started in an organized way. I think Perilous Journey was laid out very clearly as to what the expecations were and what we were trying to produce with our code. Black Thursday has been hugely helpful in that there is a lot of repetition which has reinforced the concepts. I also like how Black Thursday gives us a glimpse into what backend programming can do in real life scenerios. 

My least favorite project was probably Event Reporter. I really struggled to even begin that project and did not feel like I had adequate knowledge to produce the results that the project was looking for. I think it would have gone better if there had been slightly more guidance, because I think it was an important project with important concepts that I would have liked to have more formal instruction on,  especially leading up to Black Thursday. I feel like we do a lot of work with CSV files but have limited instruction on them. While I have learned a lot through the projects it would have been great to have some reinforcement with a class or two. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I had a harder time with independent projects. I learned that I really need to reach out and ask for help when I'm stuck. I liked being able to try different things with the code and seeing how my logic progressed. I didn't feel like a got very far with the independent projects but I because my functionality sometimes lacked I learned a lot about keeping my code organized and clean. I am confortable with Ruby syntax and breaking down methods. I learned about calling methods from other classes, parsing through csv data and creating REPL's. I can see how these are critical skills for moving forward and am glad for the knowledge I did pick up during these independent projects. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned a lot from my paired projects. The first one was quite difficult from a pairing perspective and I was feeling pretty bad about my progress at that point so I think that made it difficult for both of us, however I did learn a lot about my own behavior and what I need to do to be a better partner. I have really enjoyed working on the final paired project. We are utilizing pairing techniques, communicating well and I feel like I've improved drastically on using git and branches along with pulling information and methods from different classes. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I enjoyed all of the Gear Ups for the most part. I think they really make you examine yourself and your impact on people around you. My favorite Gear Up was probably Debugging the Gender Gap because I felt like I learned a lot about it as well. As a woman, I feel some aspects of the gender gap in my life but I haven't really experienced what the session was highlighting. Gaining a better understanding of what is actually going on in the industry and how I can be more aware of my fellow colleagues and classmates experiences is as good for me as it is for the males in the session. I also really enjoyed the Mod4 led Gear-Up. I thought they did a fantastic job and it was fun! My least favorite Gear Up was probably the Extrovert/Introvert one. It was nice to get up, move around and work with people you don't usually work with but I felt like there were a lot of people in the same range of the scale and I think the groups in the middle were kind of jumbled in terms of intro vs extro so it was a little hard to come up with ideas and work styles.  

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was a member of SAB this module. I participated in all of the events that SAB/ Turing put on and attended some of the events like Demo Night and Wellness Sessions. I lead our class Retros and really tried to make everyone in my cohort feel listened to and heard. It was a tough mod and I hope I made people feel like Turing is an inclusive environment. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would love to get more involved with some of the student groups next mod. I think the Phalka group sounds really interesting but I didn't get a chance to attend this mod. I also would like to be a little more active in terms of participation/leading things now that I am more comfortable at Turing. I also want to try to participate in Gear-Ups a little more. I sometimes hesitate to share my views and I would love to be better about that.
