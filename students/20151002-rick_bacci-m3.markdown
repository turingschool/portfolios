## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came into this module with a better understanding of some of my weaknesses as
a developer. I always thought that I needed to learn a professional
workflow and I would be well on my way to succeeding. This is certainly
important for a developer, and something that I must continue to work on.
This wasn't my main problem. I have a tendency to 'go down the rabbit-hole'
when working on projects, and don't realize that i'm doing it. I needed to
work on a way to realize when I was doing this, and take a step back and
re-evaluate the situation.


### End of Module Assessment

    * [GitHub URL](github.com/rickbacci/ontarget)
    * [Production](https://ontarget.herokuapp.com)

Completion:      3 - Developer completed all the user stories and
                     requirements set by the client.

Organization:    4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated
                     their progress in real-time.

TDD:             2 - Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design
                     (85 - 90% coverage).

Code Quality:    3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

Performance:     3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.


    I had alot of fun doing this project. I know that I need to work harder
    at getting peer feedback sooner. If i would have done this, then I
    would have discovered some gaps in my code sooner.

    I also need to look at what defines a requirement being 'complete'. A
    few times in this project I had basic functionality, but didn't quite
    relaize the amount of work remaining.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Twhatever

    * [GitHub URL](github.com/rickbacci/twitter_clone)
    * [Production](https://twhatever-175.herokuapp.com)


Completion:      3
Organization:    4
TDD:             3
Code Quality:    4
User Experience: 3


    We were asked to duplicate an app by accessing its api. I chose to
    work with twitter. I approached this project in a different manner than
    I did I my previous attempt with instagram.

    I wrote out my user-stories for the minimum requirements for the project
    and used that as my litmus test. If something popped into my head that
    would help to facilitate those goals, then I would add it to the project.

    If something was a neat idea worth exploring, then I put it in the
    backlog, to look at only when my base requirements were accomplished.

    The result was that I finished all of my requirements and delivered a
    sound product.


#### Rails Engine

    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/rails_engine2)
    * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

    In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API
    which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

Completion:   3 - 5 failures
TDD:          4 - TDD was at bottom rung of a 3 but seemed to test well not in crunch time.
Code Quality: 3 - Code quality was good and code was well refactored.
API Design:   3 - Api was set up ok.
Queries:      4 - active record queries were very good. Didn't see much ruby in queries.


## Team

### Projects

    I was a part of one team project.

#### The Pivot

    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Drew242/the_pivot)
    * [Original Assignment](https://technically-employed.herokuapp.com)


Completion:      1:   Team completed the user stories and requirements partially.

Organization:    4:   Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

TDD:             3:   Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

Code Quality:    2.5: With so many missing features, there were definitely
                      missing code monsters which would have been what
                      made the code hairy.

User Experience: 2:   Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

    We were encouraged to explore something that we didn't get to work on
    in previous projects. I chose to work on the cart for this project, because
    I didn't get to implement one previously. I also spent a lot of time
    working with css and bootstrap, which is something relatively new to me.


    We didn't get the result that we had envisioned in this app. I think there
    has to be a way to have better communication of where everyone is at with
    their user story. This would enable us to hold  others accountable,
    and for us to be able to help each other as well.



## Community

    I do my best to help anyone that asks. I did not pair with any students this
    module. I did work weekly with 2 mentors.

### Giving Feedback

    I gave feedback to all of my peers that requested it thru dm's.

### Playing a Part

    I try to pass on what I know to others. Helping others feels good especially
    when I'm stuck on something. I also tried to pass on any tips or tricks
    that I have learned, and generally be available for others.
