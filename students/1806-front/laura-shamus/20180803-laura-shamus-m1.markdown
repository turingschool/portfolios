# Laura Shamus - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, I had no experience in coding. I was determined to learn as much as possible and get a solid foundation in web development. I surprised myself with how much I learned and how quickly I picked up on concepts. I created solid study habits this module and learned how to manage my time.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects included: 
Number Guesser
Static Comp 1
Static Comp 2
Static Comp 3

#### Number Guesser

https://github.com/lkshamus/Number-Guesser

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

Static Comp 1 

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

https://github.com/lkshamus/LS-comp-challenge-1-

This project was fun because I was able to choose my color palette, fonts, and use my own photos. This was one of my first times using grid and flexbox and was excited to learn how grid and flexbox can help make a site responsive. I needed to make smaller media queries; I didn't realize an iphone was 320px! 

Static Comp 2

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

https://github.com/lkshamus/LS-static-comp-2

I worked harder on this project to perfect my smaller media queries. I was happier with how this comp came out than static comp 1. I paid more attention to detail and used hoover states on many of my buttons. 

Static Comp 3 

https://github.com/lkshamus/LS-static-comp-3

This was by far the hardest static comp so far. I worked on this comp every single day starting on the date it was assigned. I tried to make my comp look as exact to the original comp as possible. I had to use more media queries than I ever had in the past; including many media queries for both larger and very tiny screens. Overall I did the best I could with the time and resources that I had. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Linked List

https://github.com/thetabloom/LinkedList

Create an application that allows users to bookmark websites. 

This was my first time pairing with someone in a coding project. My partner and I had very different working styles but we made it work. Using GitHub felt weird at first but it was a learning experience for both of us. I was pleased with our final project that we turned in. 

HTML
  Use aria labels
  Make sure things are indented correctly - check out the style guides!
  Utilize semantic html more - ie. header tags instead of section with class of header

CSS
  Consider using organizational comments
  dry it up

JS
  Work on indentation - follow the style guides!
  dry it up
  Use template literals!
  THink more in terms of events occurring - ie. addToCount instead of refreshCount

Git/Github
  Provide more detail in messages

Feedback from Lindsey:
Thank you for sticking with the project with me. I appreciate your knowledge and your positive attitude. You are super smart and you catch onto the concepts quickly. Thank you for everything you did to help me work through JavaScript concepts. I really liked how we were able to communicate frequently. I also am happy you liked my CSS, that made me feel really good. I'd encourage you to make more git commits. And if you see your partner is struggling with concepts, I'd suggest taking time to walk them through understanding thing or let them drive so they can get the reps in. 

#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/lkshamus/IdeaBox

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Create an application that saves Ideas by appending them on the page. 

This pairing was a little smoother than the previous pairing. We worked mostly remotely and had good communication. I learned more about Github. 

Comments:

a few details in the UI could use some polish to really tighten it up
JS has quite a bit of duplication, in a great spot to refactor and reduce duplication

Functional Expectations
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style
Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
CSS

Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation
Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB
Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github
Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING
Collaboration
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

TERMINOLOGY
Technical Vocab
Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

Feedback to me from Mark: 
Great mental stamina to grind through workload. Always Looking for a solution to a problem. Very goal oriented. Overall really impressed with solutions. I believed we both learned that we need to schedule breaks in our coding sessions and take time to go over our code. Also , using the git teamwork flow would have saved us a lot of time.

##### 2DoBox

https://github.com/JoelSmith123/2DoBox-Pivot

We had to refactor someone else's IdeaBox and then turn it into a 2DoBox! 

Notes/What To Work On:
  Keep working on making more commits/branches
  Nice layout and choice of colors on your UI
  Nice work on structure and layout of HTML/CSS
  Good start with adding aria-labels
  Continue to add more aria-labels/roles to HTML especially in the forms/inputs/buttons
  Nice start on grouping classes that share similar styles
  Still room for more improvement with grouping classes and reusing classes
  Good work using no global variables
  A few functions that are over the 8 line limit (try experimenting using jQuery which can also reduce lines of code)
  Good job on being mostly consistent using function declarations in event listeners
  Experiment storing the data in localStorage as an array rather than as invidial objects
  Experiment going through your qualities with an array rather than checking if the html is set to a specific value
  Good work on keep functions SRP

Partner feedback from Joel: 
You were really great at maintaining collaboration throughout the project. At no time did I feel disconnection from the parts of the project we were working on, and for each aspect of the project you were communicative with your ideas for styling, functionality, etc. I think that made the project go really, really well, and we didn't have any miscommunication over our ideas for the project. You had a great big-picture view of what you were trying to achieve and what parts of the project to prioritize to get where we wanted to go. I'd encourage you to use your strengths at collaboration and big-picture scope to your advantage, pairing on projects, working with teams, and it'll also help in your future job hunt as those strengths are very attractive to recruiters. 
## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness:
This gear up was interesting since it focused on our wellbeing during this process. We learned about the different types of stress and coping mechanisms. It is important to know that stress is normal but there are ways to make stress more manageable. 

Strength Finder:

This was interesting because I learned what my strengths are. They include achiever, learner, input, positivity, and communication. We talked about our strengths and weaknesses and if we agreed with the StrengthFinder results. 

Debugging the Gender Gap:

I loved this gear up because it hit close to home. I am a woman and entering a career that is male dominated. It is importsnt to me that we focus on creating an accepting and equal environment. 

Feedback:

We learned how to give and recieve feedback to our peers. This was very helpful because there was an emphasis on making sure that your feedback is given in a helpful and positive manner. Constructive critisism can still be given in a positive way. 

## E: Community Participation

### I moved to Colorado without knowing anyone so being a part of the community was very important to me. I paired with many other students as often as possible. I helped others when they needed help and I always asked for help when I was struggling. I really enjoy being a part of the community, it makes me feel like I belong in Colorado.
