# James Burbage - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to absorb as much information as possible and pass the module. I also wanted to be confident in developing. The process of breaking complicated problems down seemed simple in my unrelated previous life experiences, but in web development, seemed overwhelming. I wanted a better grasp at how to tackle my learning in this new feild.

### Projects

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description
* Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### Evaluation

### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/jb-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Description
* The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/jb-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description
* Now it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.


#### Evaluation

#### My Feedback

 * I appreciated your flexibility and sympathy when I had a very rough start to the project. I also appreciated when you told me to go home when I was mentally and emotionally drained. I am grateful that, when I mentioned I wanted to work on shoring up my CSS skills, you delegated a lot of the CSS for the project to me and trusted me to get it done. I am also grateful for how much you worked with me when things didn't go as planned (i.e. when I broke the stylesheet and had to start over), and communicated with me regularly. For coaching, I would have preferred using Slack instead of GitHub to sync up our versions of the project's code. I was also frustrated when we got together to work on the project and the index.html file had been updated significantly, in my opinion; In that instance, I could have worked with the new classes in the styles.css file, thereby making our code look cleaner. I felt a bit slow and stupid when we did the driver-navigator coding on the first day, because we were going so fast and I didn't feel like I was keeping up very well, so in the future, I would recommend checking in with your partner on the pace.

### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/ideaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description
* Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

#### Evaluation

* [IdeaBox Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/graham-james.md)

#### My Feedback

 * James is a great partner. His knowledge in js and jquery proved to be a cornerstone of our success in the project and I hope to work with him again in the future. James' attention to detail is second to none. I would suggest, in certain situations, that efficiency should take precedence over concentrating on the fine details:  We can always return and refactor a project to follow the rule of DRY but when we are on a productive sprint, it's best not to slow that momentum with activities that will not accomplish our functionality goals.

### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/2DoBox-James-Freddie)

#### My Feedback

* I appreciated your skill with time boxing extensively. Your experience from going through the mod once before was essential. You knew how to keep us motivated and rotating through tasks so we didn't get stuck on just one thing, but were able to get quick wins and morale boosts by switching tasks to something we knew how to do, or go crush a mythical creature and feel re-energized. I also just appreciated your sense of humor. We had a great dynamic between each other and were able to joke around and keep ourselves in high spirits when we were stuck working on something and getting frustrated with the code. I would say that the only piece of "coaching" feedback that I could give to you is to not over-do the rotation. I know it is the final week of the mod, and that we had discussed a couple of times that we wanted to ensure that both of us were successful at pentathlon, and that is definitely important, but it is also key to remember deadlines. We were able to accomplish so much of the project and I was so proud of what we got done, but I would remember when there is a project due sooner than another, even if the other project is more daunting or more important, it is necessary sometimes to put other tasks out of your head until the first deadline has passed and then you can refocus on the task you had more time to accomplish.
