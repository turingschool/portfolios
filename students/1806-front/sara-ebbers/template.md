#  Sara Ebbers - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

It was my goal to gain exposure to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Having no prior coding experience (short of the 7 day pre-work), I wanted to use mod one to cement my decision to learn more about coding and fully commit to this career change opportunity. I hoped to gain confidence in using the tools necessary for development, such as my dev tools, git/github, and sublime.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For this Mod I completed three Static Comp Challenges and the project Number Guesser.  Additionally I worked on WishList and Mythical Creatures to practice the skills I was learning.  

Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](n/a)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description: This was a basic game where the user guesses a number.  To accomplish the project we created input fields, buttons for submission and clearing, as well as resetting the field.  I utilized messages to point the user in the correct direction.  

Evaluation comments:
Fantastic user experience
Little more spacing between header and input
Small differences in between spec and your user interface
Clean and organized html
Cheers to the use of aria "name"
Keep organization of elements, classes, ids, etc.
Grouping elements together that share similar rules
Don't put text-align on all elements :)
Clean and organized javascript
Setting default disabled in HTML
Be careful of going after the same input and having to rename it multiple times depending on logic
See if there is something with the order of the javascript so that you only have one variable to your input instead of selecting it multiple times.

#### Static Comp One

* [GitHub URL](https://saraebbers.github.io/se-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Description: I recreated an image consisting of 9 boxes and a hero image, explored styling in a responsive way, choosing colors,
icon placement, and utilization of git.  This project was created using only flex-box.  I learned the +/- of this tool
and practiced manipulating placement in this way.

Evaluation comments: Increase responsiveness, work on background images, be aware of color contrast/blending, VH causes funky squishing,
consider how icons move with responsiveness

Scores: not scored

#### Static Comp Two

* [GitHub URL](https://saraebbers.github.io/git-github.com-saraebbers-se-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Description: I recreated an image consisting of a header and information cards, explored styling using grid, and continued
to work on placement alignment.  I learned how to style icons, utilized web-based learning tools, and continue working on 
design features.  I began to incorporate media queries, and explore how images needed to be altered for small screens.

Evaluation comments: Notice how long text/headings impacts card size.  Consider drop shadows/image overlays when utilizing
icons or text over images. Add in hover states, utilize all available space on media queries/page. Grouping areas (such as the nav)
section can help to manipulate it.

Scores: not scored

#### Static Comp Three 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/saraebbers/se-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Description: I recreated a dash-board image consisting of multiple areas of graphics, images, navigation, icons, and 
careful pagelayout/design.  I continued to refine my mediaqueries / breakpoints and the responsiveness of the page.  I added
multiple hover states, worked to meet the fine details of the comp (how buttons appeared, in size/style/color).

Scores: Part of Final

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

For this Mod I completed three "official" Paired Projects and learned how very valuable my peers are for continued learning.  I paired frequently in both a formal and informal manner.  This type of learning is vastly different than what I have experienced in the past.  It took a little while to learn how to effectively pair, but I am encouraged and eager to continue to learn in this way in the future!

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/saraebbers/linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description: For this project we created a bookmark application that accepted a title and url.  This was my first real attempt to work with dynamically created elements, dom manipulation, git management, and workflow with a paired partner.

some fine tuning layout details left over
good work divvying up the work, giving each other space to work on areas solo and regrouping to work on things together when you got stuck or needed a second set of eyes.

Scores: https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/linked-list/sara-tanj.md

Work on effective communication. 

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thetabloom/Idea-Box)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description: This project deepened our understanding of DOM manipulation.  We had to organize and plan for data management in local sorage.  Additionally we worked toward utilizing event listeners, ongoing understanding of git, and information persisting on page reloads.  

(evaluation comments)
### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

### CSS
* pull duplicate declaration blocks into their own class ie. `small-button` that applies to all small buttons

### JS
* Good naming conventions
* Good Style
* Always add all relevant data to markup so that you can access via dom

https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/lindsey-sara.md#noteswhat-to-work-on

Effective utilization of paired working time.

#### to-Do-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/to-do-box/ashton-sara.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Description: This project was our first effort at refactroring another person's code.  It was interesting to see the different ways that a problem can be approached and resolved.  In addition to the refactor, we had to ensure all basic functioning was in place for the project.  

Comments: Git/Github
Good number of commits - would like more detail in each
HTML
Good use of aria labels
CSS
Avoid comma seperated selectors
JS
Decouple the data model from the markup (our ToDos could be displayed as table rows instead of cards)
Pull duplicate blocks into their own functions and pass arguments where necessary

https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/to-do-box/ashton-sara.md

Utilize poms and move on to a new problem a little sooner.

## D: Professional Skills

During our professional skill development time we completed the Strengths Assessment to help identify areas we naturally add/contribute to the team.  It is my hope that I can leverage this information to formulate my identifty as a developer.  I continue to wrestle with expressing my story and to fully embrace how I will speak to future employers about what brought me to Turing.  I continue to be open to the possibilities as they are put out before me.  I will be updating my Linked in and hope through this process that I can begin to find the words.

### Why So Salty

This gear-up helped to focus on the way we show-up and positively or negatively contribute to the environment, whether it be in our homes, classroom, or place of employment.  I have considered this frequently throughout my time at Turing, as we are constantly balancing stress, self identity, change, and sleep deprovation.  I believe that I have found a way to positively contribute to my classroom through encouraging words, inclusion, and positive affirmations.  When I am not feeling positive, I take active steps that help to remove the stress, or aide in managing it.  

### Gender 
This gear-up helped to recognize how the gender balance can be shifted based on marketing, media, bias in interviewing and other biases to which we are consciously or unconsciously aware.  It also sparked great conversation about how increased diversity has repeatedly produced better products.  It is my hope that when I move into this field, I can be a voice that amplifies the soft spoken / underrepresented, and to advocate for how inclusion is not only the correct thing to do, but is also the thing that will benefit the consumer / company.  

#### Stress Management / Mental Health
awhat a tremendous gift our mod was given by the modeling of vulnerability at the beginning of our session.  Each person I have spoken to in this module has shared his/her own personal struggle with diagnosed and/or undiagnosed social, emotional, or physical stressors.  I continue to believe it it though sharing our vulnerability that we will be strengthened.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

What a great community to be a part of!  I have taken the initiative to encourage my peers to get outside and walk during lunch, I have had at least 10 different peers join me.  I have participated in paring with peers both at Turing and also in the community.  I have swerved as a sounding board/confidant to a peer who was struggling with how to process a relationship.  I have joined in a few social activities after school, and attended one possy meeting.  I continue to meet with my mentor on a regular basis.
