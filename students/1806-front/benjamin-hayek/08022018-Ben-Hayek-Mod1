# Ben Hayek - FE 1806 Mod1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module i set out to improve and solidify my skills in HTML CSS and Javascript. I wanted to gain a great understanding of how computer programming works, and how to work through problems one step at a time. I also wanted to better my muscle memory through practice and daily coding while understanding the problem i was working through. I had almost no knowledge of programming before attending Turing and while difficult it is nice to loook back at everything ive learned in the last 6 weeks.

B: Individual Work & Projects

Here are my individual projects which i worked on throughout the mod.

Number Guesser

[Github URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/Number-Guesser)
[Origin assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For this project I had to create a number guesser game that would generate a random number and allow the user to make guesses as to what that value was. If the users guess was too low it would display that, and vice-versa for high values. This was a good introduction to Javascript.


Clean html. Make sure not to leave extra html tags. Start using some aria roles/labels Organization of classes are good - Start experiement using "ems" especially with fonts Organization of javascript is also fantastic - Well refactored and clean - Keep working on the disabled and enabled functionality.

### Static Comp Challenges

## Static Comp 1

[Github URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/bh-comp-challange-1)
[Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. ðŸ’ª You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, youâ€™ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designerâ€™s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

## Static Comp 2

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project we made a basic page that added bookmarks to a new page on a submit button click.

## Evaluation

some buggy UI behavior and a few little fine tuning layout details left over , but overall good job
code is in a good place for a refactor

## My feedback 

I really appreciate that you took initiative when it came to the JS in this project. We were both trying so many things and I think you picked up on the concepts we needed a little faster. I also appreciate you answering any questions I had about your contributions, and asking about mine. Good communication is my favorite. I did have to ask for clarification on some of the more difficult JS functions you added more than once. I think this is just due to my learning style, so in the future you might consider that others will learn differently.

#### Idea-Box

[Github URL](https://github.com/brandido/Idea-Box)
[Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

## Evaluation

UI needs some polish, fonts aren't getting pulled in
code has some verbose areas and missing functionality
in a good place for a refactor

## My Feedback

Ben was a fantastic partner to work with and learn with.  I really appreciate his patience, diligence and reliability.  We agreed to focus on learning with this project vs. trying to deliver a perfect product.  Doing so allowed us to equally contribute and do a lot of pair programming to get a lot of knowledge growth out of the project. If Ben just keeps doing what he's doing with the easy going, agreeable but confident manner, there's little doubt he'll be a very good developer and fantastic team member.  Working one-on-one with Ben is a pleasure and I'm sure as his confidence grows he'll be able to help groups out quite effectively as well.

#### Idea-Box Refactor

[Github URL](https://github.com/Sabrincodes/2DoBox-Pivot)
[Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

## Evaluation

More atomic commits and branches
Work on adding aria labels, placeholders, and roles in forms/inputs/buttons
Remove br in HTML if it's only for styling purposes
Nice work alphabetizing the properties and structure of your css
Next step for CSS, cleaning up repeated lines of CSS and grouping them together
Nice work of using constructor function
Had one function that was over 8 lines
Had one anonymous function where it could've been a function declaration
Experiment using array prototypes next time over a for loop
Try storing your 2dos as an array in localStorage rather than as separate objects
Good refactored code in general. Good use of SRP functions

## My Feedback

Ben, you were really easy to get along with, very accommodating, and kind. If we were to do this over, I would say maybe map out what we wanted to do first, have a game plan and then get into it.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
At my time at Turing i believe i have made connections that will help me to continue my career. I have used the resources given to me to answer questions i had and continue to make my mark in the community. I wish i would've attended more outside functions, but it was difficult with the full plate of work given to us. In the future i would like to branch out further.
