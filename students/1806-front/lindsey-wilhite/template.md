# Lindsey Wilhite - M1 Portfolio Round 1

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out for an immersion designing and building websites, with the intention of learning how to work on the front end aspect of web-design. I had little to no knowledge of what this actually meant. I knew what I thought it would be, and Turing ended up exceding my expectations.
I found that I made huge strides, coming from a place of not knowing what to expect out of a bootcamp. I am not satisfied, and that is my driving force to continue on with this program and make the changes I forsee in accomplishing my new goals. 
My path has evolved from not knowing what to expect, to becoming excited and tenacious in building static comps, and finally overcoming my fear of failure, writing JavaScript. I want to get my fundamentals and vocabulary down, so that I can be successful and contribute to the community through my skills in the upcoming mods.

## A: End of Module Assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser
This was our first project using JavaScript. I found that I needed to revisit the terminology and fundamentals, after being introduced to it in class.

#### Static Comp #1

- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)
- Evaluation
  _ work on media queries for larger and smaller screens
  _be mindful of the borders between grid boxes so that they look like individual areas

#### Static Comp #2

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thetabloom/static-comp-2)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)
- Evaluation
  _ watch how the grids are over lapping
  _ work on responsive layout, be more specific about target areas so they fill the screen
  _layout looks good, until it is squished or stretched
  
#### Static Comp #3

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thetabloom/static-comp-3)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
- Evaluation 
  _wrap two grids in a div to style as one unit as though each are an indiviual element for media queries
  _use ul and li for p tags in this comp
  _wrap a div or use a direct parent div to style a bunch of similar elements, in the parent instead of typeing 
    each individual one in CSS
  _work on layout of what looks good for UI, using whitespace on the page
  -work on hover states

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Linked List

Paired Project: We created a functional list where we could save individual and CSS styled cards that we interpolated from the DOM.

Partner Feedback:
Lindsey was very eager to learn and fully understand every aspect of the project. She always scheduled pairing sessions with mod2 students to help us with different parts of the project we were having trouble with. She was available late at night as well for remote pairing. I am thankful she had a flexible schedule and was available to work on the project all day on the weekend as well. Lindsey did a really great job on the project and I am very happy with the reviews we received from our instructors. I realized that Lindsey and I have different working styles when it comes to coding. If I do not know how to write a function, I will just start writing anything, even if it is wrong, and try to trouble shoot the code. Lindsey on the other hand, likes to be more precise and have an understanding of what the function should look like before beginning to write the code. This difference in working styles led to a few miscommunications, as Lindsey brought to my attention that she felt I was moving too quickly in the project. My biggest coaching feedback for Lindsey is to not worry about being as concise on the first try of writing code, because no code is ever perfect the first go-around. 

#### IdeaBox

Paired Project: We learned how to used JSON/ local storage to pull information out of the Dom and store it, with this project.

Partner Feedback:
I appreciate your drive and desire to learn, I also appreciate working through problems and how you checked back in after a concern. In future pairings, it would be good to alternate driver/navigator positions more frequently.

#### 2DoBox

Paired project: We refactored an existing Ideabox project.

Partner Feedback: 
Lindsey, I enjoyed working with you and getting to know you a bit better. I know we didn't get off to the best start, but I was really happy when you made the call to throw yourself into this fully and keep trying. I think you've got some serious talent and that you really have the potential to get great at this whole coding thing. I really appreciate that you stuck to your methods of writing things down to make sure you took care of everything. I'm sure that when I tried to explain some of my code that I wasn't totally clear about things and wish I could give you a greater understanding of it all just by walking you through it. That being said, I think it would be really beneficial for you to go in and take apart the project we just worked on with the information I gave you as a base. In fact, now that we've turned it in and the project is over, you can really have no fear about going in and pulling on things. Even if you broke the master, there's zero risk. I think you could really learn by just going in and changing stuff around to see what it does.

## D: Professional Skills

Turing is not only a place to learn code, it is a place to learn how to work as a Professional. These Links Below are the start of my Professional Development as a Software Developer. I feel these are helpful in developing an identity as a software engineer and diminishing self-doubt.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As far as the Turing Community is concerned: I feel like I have engaged people every day in some fashion. I've spent time helping other students with HTML and CSS. I have engaged upper Mods with pairing. I stuck out difficulties in pairing sessions and completed my assignments. I've been open and honest about my process with my teachers and staff, and asked for help when i needed it. I communicated with the SAB advocating to them about cohort concerns. I've developed bonds with my cohort that I will treasure. I have also tidied up when I can.
I've truly enjoyed working on developing relationships with my cohortmates. I know that what we do inside of Turing will set the stage for how we continue our professional lives outside. I've worked on being available to help out others who are struggling, and I practice communicating my boundaries when I need to. I have been buckling down hard on pairing and studying, so when I can I try to be involved on a more individual level. In the future, I would really like to attend more posse meetings to see what they are all about. I am excited to see what connections I can make outside of the screen.
