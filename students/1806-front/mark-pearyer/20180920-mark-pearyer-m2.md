# Mark Pearyer - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This Mod I wanted to more vulnerable and stepout of my comfort zone when it to asking for help. I also wanted to fully understand everything new in ES6. I also had a feeling that Array.prototype.methods would be a huge part of Mod 2 and I wanted to leave Mod 2 feeling confident in using most of them. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual project was by far one of the most challenging yet really fun projects. It took me out of my comfort zone and I really had to theorycraft a couple of the methods on the whiteboard. This was the first real challenge of the bootcamp for me, and i grew a lot not only in technical skills, but softskills as well.

Passed

Autocomplete features are a very common convention for text inputs on search fields. In this project you are going to be building a low level version of an auto complete system in JavaScript.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects felt like a continuation of Mod 1, where I was doing a lot of teaching until I got to my last project. I was a little burntout at the end of gametime but I bounced back for Weatherly. What I learnt throughout these projects is that you have to adapt to each project and find creative ways handle situations. Also, the power of organization, planning, and collaboration is a great combination you should always strive for. 

#### Game Time

Passed

Learn object oriented programming (OOP) principles by building a game that is playable in the browser.

Functional Expectations
3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

Solid refactoring to include the Snake class & test it over the weekend but with tests like this make sure you are asserting a particular length first, then calling growSnake, then asserting the new length. Tough for me to tell by this test alone if the snake always has a length of 9 or if it's actually growing. What's it's original length?

JavaScript Style & OOP
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.
Workflow
3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

Really nice commit messages - consistent and readable. A+!

Try to never commit commented out code, like here. If you were to pull request this, it would make it really hard for the other developer to read the diff and understand exactly what's happening.

#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcusp619/weatherly-mp-tg)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Passed

Weatherly was the best experience I had with the planning, whiteboarding, organization, and balance of the workload in a collaborative effort. It makes a real difference when both partners are on the same page and supporting one another. I definitely will reflect on this project to try and re-enact the experience.

## D: Community Participation
I helped out Mod 1 students with projects and I was available for questions in the morning and lunch time. I also, checked up on the the 1806 students that had to repeat mod 1 and tried to keep their spirits high and help them out with anything. I taught mythical creatures twice as well.

### Playing a Part

Second time around doing SAB! This time around I really wanted to focus on being a voice for my cohort, as we are the biggest cohort in Turing and a lot of the problems that arised had not been seen. I also wanted to voice my cohorts suggestions to the best of my ability. It was a great experience being apart of SAB for the second time around, Im going to miss it.
