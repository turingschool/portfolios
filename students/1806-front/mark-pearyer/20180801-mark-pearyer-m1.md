# Mark Pearyer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I setout this Mod to get a solid foundation on Javascript, as well as improve my CSS skills. Prior to turing I was teaching myself how to code and I always shied away from CSS because I found it difficult to learn. I also wanted to learn from my instructors and peers not only technical skills but soft skills as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects is where I beleive I learned the most and was probably the most challenging for me. I have always neglected practicing and learning CSS, so the static comps were a great way to challenge myself, as well as get some much needed practice in learning CSS. "It's basically like throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks."

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were where we focused on our javascript skills and pushed ourselves to learn. This was exciting for me since I love working with javascript and figuring out solutions to problems. What was challenging was working with someone else and trying to find the right balance to where you both are learning.

### (feedback to me)
-Mark was great to work with. Mark was straightforward when we first got paired in letting me know his schedule, what he would work on and how. He was hardworking because he never fell behind schedule but instead knocked out functionalities for fun. He had a dedicated attitude probably because of his past in the US Navy. For coaching, if he was to pair with someone with a different skillset again, I definitely would recommend he pair in person more often. Our face to face pairing and remote pairing was well balanced for our particular skillsets. The guys is well-rounded as a person and programmer. I really don't know what I can tell him to make him better, in fact I kinda look up to him.
#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lkshamus/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### (description)
- Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

 -Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.
### (evaluation comments)
- a few details in the UI could use some polish to really tighten it up
- JS has quite a bit of duplication, in a great spot to refactor and reduce duplication

### (evaluation scores)
* Functional Expectations
 - Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
 - Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
* HTML
* Accessibility
 - Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
 - Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Style
 - Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
 - Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
* CSS
* Structure of Code
 - Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
 - Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
* Implementation
 - Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
 - Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
* JAVASCRIPT
* Data Types
 - Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
 - Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
* Conditional Logic
 - Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
 - Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
* Functions & Scope
 - Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
 - Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
* Arrays
 - Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
 - Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
* Objects & Prototypes
 - Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
 - Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
* DOM Manipulation
 - Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
 - Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
* Style
 - Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
 - Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
* GIT & GITHUB
* Git
 - Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
 - Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* Github
 - Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
 - Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
* DESIGN
* Comp Recreation
 - Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
 - Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
* PAIRING
* Collaboration
 - Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
 - Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* TERMINOLOGY
* Technical Vocab
 - Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
 - Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
### (feedback to me)
- Mark was available at all hours of the day/ night to work remotely on this project. I know he has a family that keeps him busy when he is not at school, so I am grateful for his flexibility when working on this project together. On the night before the project was due, we had two different approaches on how to solve our few remaining problems. We were working remotely and we both decided to solve the remaining issues differently, which caused other aspects of the code to crash. In the end, we fixed everything and our project turned out great. We both should have communicated more effectively this day so that we wouldn't have ran into the small issue that we did. 

#### 2DoBox Pivot

### (description)
- Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…
  We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.
  You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

### (feedback to me)
-I really appreciated the pace at which we worked throughout the project. I think we had a good DTR and stuck to it well throughout the project. I got a lot out of this project and we had a solid eval.Thanks for taking the time to talk me through a lot of the code throughout the project. We both wanted to improve our git flow and I felt good about how git went as well. Keep taking the time to do a solid DTR because in reflection it was very helpful for our pairing. Continue to remember to talk through the code as it helps move the project along and keeps everyone up to speed. Your communication and explanation was very effective.
## D: Professional Skills
I really enjoyed learning about everything in professional development. This transition from military to civilian life has been a real eye opener on how far behind military people are in soft skills.
