# (Justin Stewart) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to solidify my learning and understanding of javascript using ES6 and develop a foundational understanding of react
and the difference between basic concepts such as state/stateless and props vs state.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS - with work still needed in array prototypes iterators over the break.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects that I worked on with some collaboration with others, these projects showcase my understanding of the skills needed
to continue learning in my journey as a software developer.

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

My personal version of Frogger. This project was the first with multiple files which was challenging. Other challenges arose through
this project that I was able to pull together and produce a playable game.

#### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project was by far one of the hardest of the module. This project showcases the knowledge, implementation and understanding of 
a prefix-trie. Building this project in phases was one of the most helpful actions I did take, with challenges popping up throughout 
the project that i was able to trouble shoot with the help of others, and breaking this VERY complicated concept down into one problem
at a time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This project demonstrates no only my ability to work together as an effective team member. Planning, meeting deadlines and co-working
has been a huge emphasis since being at turing and this is something I feel like I have excelled in, and with this project in specific I
think you can truly tell.

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kayyali18/weatherly-AK-JS)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

A weather app that a pulls current data using an API that allows you to search for a current, hourly and 10 day for any valid location 
within the United States.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Being at the wrap ups and attending social events. I think there is this urge to push anything not coding to the side, but I
think playing a part in this community is prioritizing these exact things.
