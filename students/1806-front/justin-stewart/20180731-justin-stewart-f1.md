# (Justin Stewart) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to get the best understanding and to be able to apply that understanding of HTML and CSS to create functional layouts of webpages and applications. I understood coming into this module that programming it a long road, and that road would begin here with a foundation of javascript/JQuery. I feel as if I have that foundation I sought out to get with a long road ahead of me.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Number Guesser)

(This project was our very first project. The idea was to have a minimum and maximum possible numbers, the user would then try to guess that possible number. The user could guess until the number guessed was correct. The value entered had to be a number or you would recieve and error message.)

(I found your open communication and honesty with me throughout the project to be super helpful in knowing what your personal goals for the project were, and for evaluating my own role in the project. You not only showed attention to the project but you also showed care for my personal well-being, from asking me if I was comfortable with my role, to asking me if I had got enough sleep. There were several stages in the project where you had more knowledge of the tools we were using than I did, and in those times you were happy to explain to me what was going on and made sure I understood before continuing with the work. Thank you! It was our first time pairing; I really don't have any coaching. Just keep up the open communication with any future partners and you'll be great.)


#### (Idea-Box)

(I really appreciated that Justin and I were always on the same page when it came to all work on the project.  He and I really collaborated well and came up with some great solutions, especially concerning the more complicated JS parts of the project.  He was always available and definitely carried his fair share of the work.  He is smart and a really good partner. The only issue we really seemed to have is that we would go for hours and forget to commit or push to GitHub.  This, however, was an issue that we both had, so it was just as much on me as it was on him.  This is nothing that more practice working on projects with GitHub won't fix.)


#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [GithubURL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/2dobox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(This was a refactoring of an OLD Idea-Box, In the Spirit of refactoring their were creative contraints placed upon how we could write out code specifically in JS. This project flexed our skills and problem solving ability to work around specific challenges)

(Have not revieved feedback at this time)

## D: Community Participation

(Attending Demo nights, code fairs, and after hours socials)

### Playing a Part

(I've played a part by helping out as many other turing students as possible. I think one thing I've dont exceptionally well is get to know the individuals within my cohort. asking them how their day is going and just checking in. Turing does a great job of showing your the road to success, and pairing, staying after, and being a part of volunteer events has been something I've strived my hardest to do in the alst 6 weeks)
