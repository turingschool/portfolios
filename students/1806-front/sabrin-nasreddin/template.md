# (Sabrin Nasreddin) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis


I set out to learn as much as I could. I set out to learn the html, css and the Js we were taught and to also hone my my skills on how to learn best when it comes to web development. I figure Technologies will always change but I think if I continue my quest on growing and improving how I learn, while I pick up the skills I need now, I'll be able to pick up the new tech as it comes.  I also wanted to become more efficient  in the way I juggle all that is thrown at us so that I'm maximizing my learning in everything.

## A: End of Module Assessment

 I don't feel I passed the mythical creatures or stat-comp-3 parts. I do believe I have gained a lot of knowledge and have learned so much more than when I first started. I worked so hard, but I don't feel I'm where I could be to be 100% comfortable in MOD2.

Evaluation Scores- Novice
(feedback to me)= code is a little messy: watch indentation and nesting
remember that HTML structure and nesting is the foundation of everything you're building, so work to really lock in solid HTML before you start adding CSS and JS
watch for unused properties in your CSS
watch for long functions and think about places to refactor

Description =

A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
