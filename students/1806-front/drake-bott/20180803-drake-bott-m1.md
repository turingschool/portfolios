# Drake Bott - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Learn the fundamentals.  Coming into Turing I had no experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  My past experience with some light coding in Highschool from 2? years back was in Java, and 5? years ago in Python.  I feel that I have the fundmentals down, but I am definitely a lot stronger with Javascript than CSS.  My CSS works, but could be better I think.  My most recent partner evaluation hit spot on I think.  My partner pointed out that I often just shoot to finish what is required, but with the extra time I could be pushing myself further to learn more.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work for mod 1 is the Number Guesser project.  It was the first project assigned in the mod.

#### Number Guesser

#####  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bottd/Number-Guesser)
#####  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#####  Intro
* Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  This project was an intro to DOM manipulation, and my first time using javascript.

##### Evaluation comments: 
 * Keep in mind UX (user experience)
 * Add save button for min/max
 * Being able to use reset button without having to make a guess
 * Adding aria labels for inputs and buttons
 * Small refactor: use of multiple spans in title instead of using cascading styles
 * Cleaning up styles and removing repeated lines
 * Add some spacing for CSS and javascript for readability
 * Careful of nested if/else statements
 * Use function declarations for event listeners that have the same functionality to remove repeated code

##### Evaluation scores
 * Functional Expectations: Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
 * COMP RECREATION / DESIGN: Advanced Beginner
 * HTML: Advanced Beginner / Proficient
 * CSS: Advanced Beginner

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

After Number Guesser, the rest of our Javascript related projects were done in randomly assigned groups of 2.  These projects were Linked List, Idea Box, & 2DoBox Pivot.

#### Linked List

#####  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bottd/Linked-List)
#####  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### Intro
* Linked List was a simple application where the user has 2 input fields, one for a title and another for a url.  The user enters text into both fields and can submit to add it to the page.  This was the first time I had been adding new HTML to the DOM with javascript.

##### Evaluation comments
* HTML
    * Use aria labels
    * Utilize semantic html more - ie. header tags instead of section with class of header
* CSS
    * Love those organizational comments
    * Be sure to google syntax of media queries while implementing
    * dry it up
* JS
    * Work on indentation - follow the style guides!
    * dry it up
    * Use template literals!
* Git/Github
    * Need More commits!!!

##### Evaluation scores

##### Feedback to me
* I really appreciated your flexibility and patience during our first project. You took the time to let me talk through our code to make sure that I understood. I also appreciated your flexibility with our pairing sessions, whether it was remote or in person. Thank you! I encourage you to remain flexible and patient with your future partners that may be less confident in their coding abilities. These qualities made working together beneficial and enjoyable.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Description

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).  This project was the first time we used local storage.

##### Evaluation comments

* General: Check out the style guides!!!!!
* HTML: use aria labels on inputs
* CSS
    * pull duplicate declaration blocks into their own class ie. small-button that applies to all small buttons
    * style guide
* JS
    * Work on naming conventions - no need to say data type but think about using plural words
    * air on the side of being too descriptive
    * Love that you are leveraging prototypes and your constructor well
    * Separate the data model from the markup
    * Think about having a qualities array
* Git
    * Would like to see more commits

##### Evaluation scores

* Functional Expectations
    * Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
* HTML
    * Accessibility
        * Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
    * Style: Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
* CSS
    * Structure of Code
        * Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
        * Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
    * Implementation: Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
* JAVASCRIPT
    * Data Types
        * Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
    * Conditional Logic
        * Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
    * Functions & Scope
        * Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
        * Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
    * Arrays
        * Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
        * Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
    * Objects & Prototypes
        * Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
    * DOM Manipulation
        * Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
    * Style
        * Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
        * Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### Feedback to me

* I appreciate your willingness to take the time to make sure I understood everything. There was a while when I was pretty lost + confused on some of the functionality that was added but by the end of the project when we got together I was able to go through any of the functions and say what was being done. My biggest point of advice is developer empathy. I would say that on a larger code base or a larger project with a bunch of people it is crucial to name variables with as obvious of names as possible. Especially at the level we are at, even just a moment of needing to analyze variable names, function names, class names to understand what is being targeted is using brain energy which could be used making the code work. Its something that will of course get easier over time, but any time it is possible, if you use the most obvious name that anyone will understand it will make it easier for others to work with your code.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dhanciles/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

##### Description

* For this project we were given an old codebase for the Ideabox to refactor and then convert over to 2DoBox, adding more functionality.

##### Evaluation comments

* Notes/What To Work On:
   * Make sure the layout works on mobile/small screens, currently is a lil broken on small screens
   * Looks good on large screens, just a few fine tuning details around spacing, disabled states, and clearly communicating      * What is a clickable thing vs text
   * Make sure to prioritize ARIA
   * CSS still needs a tidy pass, there are a few properties that aren't doing anything
   * Missing the closing HTML tag!
   * Overall, well done!
   * CSS and HTML could use a last clean up pass to catch final details

##### Feedback to me

* Drake I really appreciated your patience and your willingness to try different things. Obviously throughout refactoring this code we discovered bugs on top of bugs, and took time to fix these issues. You stayed positive as we worked through things and we kept the  dialogue while figuring out how to solve problems, which is a great skill to have while pairing rather than just shutting the other person out. The best advice I could give you is to keep pushing forward on your projects and have more attention to detail. After pairing with you it really opened my eyes to how great of a developer you really are, and I feel you could be even better by pushing yourself to take projects to the next level, even though we'd already hit on the the requirements. 

## D: Professional Skills
* Throughout the mod we had gear up and professional development class sessions to learn more about professional and personal skills.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

In the Health and Wellness gear up we talked a lot about mental and physical health.  One big topic was stress and stress management.  I liked hearing what other people do to maintain their wellness and keep a handle on their stress.  One takeaway was self care kits.  I have not made one, but I think they are a really useful tool for people that need a way to handle a ton of stress.  It is something I would look to and possibly utilize if I found myself in that situation.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

The debugging gear up was about the gender gap in the tech industry.  I think it is good that people are taking an initiative to push for a more even distribution of men and women in this field.  One of my takeaways was that it is important to have people of a diverse background when developing a product.  An example of this is when airbags were first developed, the engineers were all average sized men.  This caused the airbags to be lethal for women and people of smaller sizes.  

#### Relax

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1806-inning/relax.md)

The relax gear up was my favorite gear up out of all of them, probably because I got a bunch of free kool aid.  I also liked it because we all got a chance to vent/show how we got past some stress.  My big takeaway was what some people do to relax, after this gear up I have started seriously considering taking short runs in the morning before I come in since I usually have a lot going on in my head when I wake up in the morning.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Since I wasn't really around much after class due to commuting, I tried to stay active in the couple 1806 chat channels being as helpful as possible and working towards answering as many questions as I could people had problems came up.
