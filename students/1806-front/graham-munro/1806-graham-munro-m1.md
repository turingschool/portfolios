# Graham Munro - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with no practical experience in Javascript/Jquery, HTML, and CSS. So my goal was to gain a practical working knowledge in those competencies.

##### Build an application to save your web bookmarks

##### Feedback
* More detailed commits
* More branches when adding new features or working on bugs
* Super clean UI
* Maybe add more messages for UX if it isn't a valid url/etc.
* Try adding aria roles/labels to inputs/buttons
* Careful of using too many divs. Try using more semantic html
* Good organization of CSS
* Experiment using percentages of height/width and pixels for padding/margin for honing in styling
* Good job of consistency of breaking out functions from event listeners
* Display none instead of hiding in javascript
* Remember if/else statements evaluate on true/false. If a function is already returning true there doesn't need to be a === check

##### Partner Feedback
You were an awesome partner to have in just about every way. We had extremely similar working styles so it was easy to work together. You were very understanding of my schedule limitations. You were driven in your goals and this made it possible for us to achieve them all. You are also very organized and this really helped out with developer empathy. It was easy to understand everything you did with the code and this made it so easy to add things to the code and to articulate what different functions were doing. My only piece of coaching feedback would partially fall on my hands. I think it would be important in the future for both partners to work on styling and functionality. I know we had planned things this way, as I wanted to gain your eye for detail with CSS and you wanted to become more confident in your Javascript, and I think we did just that. But looking back I feel that it would have probably been best for both of us to be improving both of these skills. I would not really consider this to be your fault at all, and I do think I learned some things on the Javascript end, but I do think in the future this might not be the best way for either of us to go about things and to maybe just divvy up specific parts of the project rather than whole languages to be working on.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gmasterofnone/ideaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Build an application to save your ideas

##### Feedback
* Work on adding aria roles and labels
* Careful not to add divs in order to fix styles if it is not necessary
* Nice structure of css, good organization
* Keep working on improving drying up styles resusing classes
* Good work on separating rems/ems for text and pixels/percentages when honing in on styles
* Great work on not using global variables
* Good separation of event listeners and functions
* Nice job breaking out functions into smaller functions
* Next steps, try putting ideas into an array in local storage for organization reasons
* With qualities, try have them in an array and moving up or down using the index

##### Functional Expectations
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
##### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
Proficient
##### Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
##### Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
##### CSS
* Structure of Code: Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Implementation: Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
##### JAVASCRIPT
Data Types: Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic: Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope: Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Arrays: Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Objects & Prototypes: Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
DOM Manipulation: Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style: Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
##### GIT & GITHUB
Git: Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
Github: Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
##### DESIGN
Comp Recreation: Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.
Collaboration: Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partnerâ€™s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
Technical Vocab: Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

##### Partner Feedback
Graham was very easy to work with. We made a lot of progress in our first couple of days and were able to complete the majority of the project very quickly.  I had zero issues working with you and collaborating with you on the project. I think you were a great partner and even though we didn't get started until Saturday we were able to complete a lot very quickly. If I had to pick one thing to say as coaching feedback, it would be for you to remember to take more breaks! I know you're very driven and that's great, but you don't want to push too hard and burn yourself out.

##### Refactor a former student's IdeaBox project and add additional functionality

##### Functional Expectations
Proficient

##### Git/Github
Would like to seem more commits, and more context provided
##### HTML
Use of aria labels to provide more context
##### CSS
Avoid comma seperated selectors, use a more broad class instead
##### JS
Separate data model from markup - constructor could be task - it is not a card until its displayed on the page
Consider using bracket notation for refactoring

##### Partner Feedback
Graham was a great project partner. He and I worked on 95% of the project together, and we had no issues with communication or other conflicts. Graham didn't mind if I 'drove' most of the time which allowed me to grasp exactly what we were doing and where we were going. We had many great wins and learning moments during this project and our strengths complimented each other's well. Graham was very patient and willing to celebrate wins (many high-5s were shared). At the beginning of the project, Graham was quick to interrupt me and point out if there were holes in my logic before I was able to realize it myself. This could have resulted in problems, but after noticing my mild frustration, he asked me what the best way to comment while I'm in the middle of a thought was. He then incorporated my feedback and adjusted his responses appropriately. Thanks, Graham!


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

In this session we discussed all the various types of stress. I learned that I go into a state of hypotension and that it is best in tht situation to listen to interesting music.

#### Code 2.0

I learned that diversity is the cornerstone to building great products because of commonality between the many contributors and potential users.  I learned not to assume, but to be inquisitive to learn more about your peers.

#### Not present for Relax due to medical issues**

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

While I feel that I could of played a larger part in Turing's community during Mod 1, I feel my overal contribution was meaniful and benificial to others.  For instance, often times I would be comfortable enough in a particular subject and stay late after school to help any peers that may be struggling.  I participated in DEMO day, which was really fun.  And I made a point to meet students from other Mods so that if I saw they were not having a good day I could try and cheer them up.
