# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing without much background in coding other than what I'd done for the prework, so my goal was really to try to absorb as much knowledge as possible on as many subjects as I could. I feel like I've learned a ton already and am beginning to feel like I understand coding more broadly. I can look at code now and mostly grasp what is going on. In addition, my ability to read the docs and to follow what is happening on stack exchange have greatly increased. I now feel like with enough time I can go and figure out almost anything I need to do.

* **E: Community Participation**: 2

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed the module. I've worked hard to do as many phases of every project as possible and also to make sure that I collaborated closely with my partners. I learned a lot at each phase of each project and did my best to challenge my self rather than just get things done.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The only individual project we did that actually required JS was Number Guesser. In all of my individual projects though, I tried to not only accomplish the assignment but see what I could learn while doing so. Therefore, when I did static comp 1, I built it mostly through grid, then started over and built it with flex in order to get a handle on both of them. Additionally, for Number Guesser, I really wanted to try to do all the phases and make it a fully functional game. In hindsight, I wish I'd paid more attention to UX. 

Individual Projects Include:

Number Guesser
Static Comp 1
Static Comp 2
Static Comp 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were a great opportunity for me to start to  see what coding will be like in the "real world." I worked with others and found a lot of value as well as a fair amount of frustration in doing so. A big source of my frustration came from my own struggles with git and gitHub, but I also think it can be hard at times to be patient (something that's true for me in all of my life) when I may want to move quicker than my partner. At the same time though, I learned a ton when I really had to go back and think about why I wrote the code I wrote in order to explain it to my partner. I also learned a lot from my partners who had different strengths from my own.

Group Projects Include:

Linked List
Ideabox
To Do Box Pivot

## Student: Kevin and Aaron
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

-

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

## Students: Lindsey & Aaron
## Evaluator: Holt
## Notes/What To Work On:
- Great job on functionality! 👍
- Some great examples of using helper functions to acieve SRP 🤗
- Would like to see more clear names (make function names actions, don't use words like "anything" for block variables!) throughout
- Make sure that git commit messages are consistent over time and partners - make sure you get clear on this in DTR in future. Should complete the sentence "This commit will ___________________".

## D: Professional Skills
I come from a background in sales, which means that I have had to force myself to learn strong communication skills over the years. Therefore, it is my hope that I have been able to maintain a good level of professionalism with my classmates and teachers as well as the greater Turing community during Mod1. 

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

Mental Health
This session was helpful to me as someone starting out at Turing and trying to think about how to make sure that I maintain strong mental health throughout my time here as well as once I leave. Even if there are some parts of this that I may feel like I know already, having these sessions as a reminder and some encouragement is very helpful. 

Bridging the Gender Gap
This is such an essential part of helping the dev community grow both in size and in knowledge base. The company I worked for in Boston had a series of key values, and one of those was "hire more women." Working there helped me understand, that not only is hiring a diverse staff important and the right thing to do, but it can have a strong positive impact on your bottom line as well. Bringing in a diversity of ideas is how you make a more dynamic product.

I was out sick during the last Gear Up session, so I will write about the Gear Up session I attended during my 'Try Coding Weekend'
Agism in the dev community
This Gear Up was mostly focused around a comment that Mark Zuckerberg made basically claiming that older folks cannot learn to code or at the very least cannot learn to code well. We discussed why statements like that are detrimental and discussed how we can make sure to stop that type of discrimination in the dev community.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
My biggest contribution to the Turing community was by helping my peers with their projects throughout the mod. As a mod 1er, it can be hard to find other ways to be involved, but I think through just being around, available, and engaged, I was able to start to settle in as a member of this community and will continue to find ways to contribute. Additionally, I have been dilligent about cleaning up after myself and even doing any extra dishes I find in the sink when I wash my own.
