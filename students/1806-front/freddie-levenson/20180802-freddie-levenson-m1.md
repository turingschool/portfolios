# Freddie Levenson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Mod 1 I focused on becoming skilled in the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Coming into the school with hardly any experience I wanted to be sure to build a strong foundation for the future. I also focused on building a good foundation for workflow for the future. Getting enough sleep, eating well enough, studying hard whenever any material was unclear, asking for help when it was needed, and utilizing any opportunity to help someone as an opportunity to both help a friend but also solidify my own knowledge of the topic were all things I focused on. I made it a goal that whenever in a group project I fully understood all code that was implemented, even if it wasn't something I wrote myself. I feel I did well with my goals and learned an immense amount while making strong bonds with my cohort mates.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

For this project I created a number guessing game where on page load the website generated a number between 1 and 100, and the game challeneged the user to guess the correct number. As the user guessed the website would let them know if their guess was too high or too low. When they guessed the correct number the application would tell them BOOM! you are correct! It was a really fun introduction to using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a functional web application through DOM manipulation, Javascript Logic, and basic Math.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Linked List

In this project we were asked to make an application where you could create bookmarks for yourself and they would be displayed in a separate list on the side. It was a test of our dom manipulation skills with more layers added on than in number guesser, including prepending items to a list, and deleting items from the screen. I learned a lot about event delegation, creating elements into your page using Javascript, and about working with a partner on a project.

- [Feedback to me from Graham]:It was a pleasure working with you, Freddie. Your outgoing personality removed a lot of communication barriers that enabled us to execute this project efficiently.  Your ability to easily understand our group code was also extremely valuable. I know that on a few occasions you looked as though you had an idea but rather than speaking up, you decided to go with the flow.  The ideas and concepts you did introduce in this dynamic effort were extremely strong and important to our success. In future projects, I'd encourage you to offer your ideas and feedback as the value in that will outweigh any gain in efficiency.

#### IdeaBox

In this project we were asked to create an application that would allow you to put Ideas you had onto a page, and then upvote or downvote the ideas based on their quality. We were required to make it so that the ideas persisted on page reload, adding another layer on top of linked list and teaching us the basics of local storage and JSON. I learned so much with this project, giving me the ability to leverage local storage and also challenging me once again to work with a partner. This project I was not at the same level of my partner, and rather than letting him drag me along behind him I learned to read someone else's code until it made sense to me and I was able to implement the same functions myself. This was a huge challenge that I had to overcome. I also learned a lot about remote pairing, as my partner was not as available to work on-site as I tend to do.

- [Feedback to me from Drake]: I thought it was super awesome that you were ready to jump in and start working.  I feel like a lot of times I work with people it can take a while to get started because they want to finish every possible other task they have first.  We did great on the project, and I was glad we were able to get some work done remote without having to be constantly looking over one another's shoulders. I don't think there is much to coach you on. You identified that you weren't feeling too strong on javascript and let me know that and we were able to work together to help your understanding.  I think that you did awesome, maybe just find some ways to practice your weak topics more on your own time so that you feel more comfortable working through the problems without feeling the need to apologize for being behind.  

#### 2DoBox

This project was a doozy. We were asked to refactor someone's version of IdeaBox who had made a pretty messy code base. We had to refactor it to fit the style guides, and also make it so that the project was fully functional. We accomplished this and then were asked to pivot the project into a 2DoBox, changing it from a place to store ideas and rank their quality, into a place to store tasks that needed to be accomplished and rank their importance. This was both a test in reading someone elses code and making sense of it, but also altering it to be clean and functional. It was a huge challenge but it was very worthy and I learned so much. It also forced me to sharpen the skills from IdeaBox, specifically local storage and JSON.

- [Feedback to me from James]: I appreciate your willingness to put a lot of time into our project. You seem very dedicated to accomplishing tasks through the project and it was awesome working with you. I really appreciate your communication throughout and I felt like we had no issues at all. For coaching, the only thing I can think of is that you need to take more breaks! But I do like the fact that you are driven and are so excited to learn throughout this process.

## D: Professional Skills

Professional development at Turing was a valuable experience. We took the strenghts finder test which was a higher level personality test than most, and showed us our strengths when it comes to work and social interaction. It was great to learn a little more about myself and how to leverage my strengths and also look at places where I needed to work on myself. We also learned about how to give and recieve feedback, something that everyone needs to know, especially in a profession where your personal work is constantly critiqued. Also we learned about Pairing and how to do it effectively, especially when you may not have the same strengths, learning style, or personality as the person you are going to pair with, which is often inevitable. Lastly we learned about storytelling and how to tell our personal story, and how that relates to creating an online presence for yourself.

### Gear Up

#### Mental Health 101

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

The gear up on mental health was really great. we talked about stress and the different types of stress that people encounter. We also talked about different ways to properly handle stress and to manage self care properly. This was great for me because it was an opportunity to examine myself a little bit and to understand better the stress that I have experienced throughout the past few years. I know that everyone experiences stress at some points in their life, sometimes all the time, and it was good to think about ways to manage it and to do our best to make sure it does not have lasting reprocussions on your lives.

#### Code 2.0: Debugging the Gender Gap

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This gear up was really important. I think that as a white male, sometimes it can be easy to cruise along in life without thinking about the negatives that other people are experiencing who aren't in our shoes. I tend to be very empathetic and try to think about other people's situations when I can, but too often I find other people saying or doing things which ignore the experiences others have. Specifically relating to gender and race, I know that the way I live my life is not common to others, even as simple as feeling comfortable in the city while there are many threats to others well being, especially as a woman. The same can go for the workplace, and it is crazy to see how old-world some of the common practices are. It was crazy to think about how people taught women about the tech industry, and I think it is important to do anything we can do to reverse this, and increase the diversity within the industry. Diversity of people results in a diversity of ideas and opinions and experiences, resulting in better applications and more problems being solved.  

#### Excited AF about AR/VR

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1806-inning/group6.md)

This was a really fun and informative gear up presented to us by the mod 4 students. I have very limited experience in AR and VR which is why I chose this session. I had the impression that we would be trying out some AR and VR, but instead it was a really interesting and informative lecture on the other applications of AR and VR, outside of the common gaming experience most envision. It was cool to think about the applications of AR/VR in health, construction, education, and beyond. 

## E: Community Participation

I have enjoyed participating in the community at Turing. Everyone in our cohort and those above us have been inspiring individuals to be around. I both utilized the opportunities to pair when I had problems understanding the material and also giving my time to others to help them along when I felt strong. Its never fun to see someone struggling and if it were something I was strong at, like CSS or Mythical Creatures, I was always ready to break things down in the way that helped me understand things, and I like to think that I really helped people understand things that were difficult to them.


### Playing a Part

Connecting with my cohort mates and those around me has been a blast for me. I have a tendency to be a little more outgoing than most and so I had fun making bonds with almost everyone here. Whether it was giving someone a pound at the beginning of the day making them feel included, or taking an opportunity to keep jokes rolling in class and give everyone a bit of relief from the stress, I tried my best to uplift the spirits of those around me. When I saw someone struggling I reassured them and reminded them that everyone struggles. I also gave people congratulations and respect when they were crushing it, especially if that was not the norm for them, to make them feel validated in their success. I also went out of my way to attend extra curricular events like demo nights and the SAB cookoff as an opportunity to meet others outside of the cohort and to create lasting bonds.
