#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/IntrepidPanda/NumberGuesserV2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/number-guesser/jessica-erickson.md)

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a number guessing game app, based on a list of phased functionality requirements and a design spec. Since I was still learning the Turing process at the time, I made a point of taking the feedback I got and using it to update my code, which I did not have the time for, but I don't necessarily regret doing so. There are a few bits of feedback I got on this project that have defined my coding style; Now, I use kabob-case in my html files, default to using multiple classes for styling selectors, use organizational comments in the css file and not the others, leverage the "cascading" part of CSS, and am more descriptive when naming variables and classes. 

As a direct result of this assignment, I try much harder to consider how to make web applications more accessible to people who use screen-readers, in addition to already trying to make them accessible for people who need larger font sizes. There are obvious accessibility problems in the final version of this project, particularly in using a mouse-enter event listener, but I hadn't thought of that at the time; I was mostly just excited about all the different kinds of event listeners I could use.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/IntrepidPanda/je-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project has a readme file that describes what it is.

Internalized feedback:

* Try not to use a black background where a full image should be.
* Control the sizing of elements so that they don't squish down proportionate to screen size.
* Change sizing and placing of elements to fill space, instead of putting in filler blocks.
* Make sure buttons are big enough on mobile to be easy to click on.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/IntrepidPanda/je-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project has a readme file that describes what it is.

Internalized feedback:

* Use color overlays on entire cards, and remove them on hover to really make them pop/make the website feel more interactive and exciting.
* Use hover states.
* Center items in the page, and control their spacing so that it is obvious they are connected.
* Display one centered card per row on mobile.
* Control the sizing of text through media queries to prevent wonkiness at smaller screen sizes.

#### Static Comp 3 *Pending*

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/IntrepidPanda/je-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This project has a readme file that describes what it is.

Internalized feedback:

* Don't let buttons jump around on hover.
* Size individual bits of content to be the width of the screen on mobile.
* Change the visual representation of tabs when the screen is too small to show their names.
* Make nested elements more apparent in html.
* Make multi-selectors in css more apparent.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/IntrepidPanda/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/linked-list/james-jessica.md)

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a web application that took a website name and url from the user, and displaying that input in a lovely card format. To do this, we generated new card html text for each individual submission, and appended it to the page. In order to remove the generated cards, or to mark a link as read, we utilized an event listener on the parent element, then used an if statement to define functionality for the "read" and "delete" buttons.

I struggled the most with this assignment, because it was the first time I had done a group project in two years and my social anxiety was flaring up something fierce, due to being in a new environment with new people. My project partner, James, was already well-versed in keeping up good communication, so I was able to quickly follow his lead in that aspect, but I still struggled a bit with asserting myself when I thought we were going the wrong direction in task delegation. Even so, I am proud of the work I did on the styling of this application, and did learn a great deal of JavaScript from James.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoelSmith123/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/jessica-joel.md)

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a web application that utilized local storage to allow users to track ideas. We took an idea title and an idea explanation from the user, generated a card to display on the page, and stored that data in local storage, using .now() to generate unique identifiers for each data set.

This was the first assignment I tried using jQuery with, so, while we were working on it, I was learning how to navigate the jQuery docs and learning what the jQuery equivalents for some JavaScript array methods were. I enjoyed working with jQuery, because it was faster to write, and the corresponding docs were faster to parse. I disliked working with jQuery, because errors would show up in the jQuery script, instead of the script we wrote, so bugs were harder to track down and fix.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustinTorrance/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/to-do-box/jessica-justin.md)

This was, by far, my favorite project to work on at Turing; We took a former student's IdeaBox code, and were tasked with making it functional, then refactoring it for a similar purpose. I loved working on this project, because I could see the ideas that the originator was getting at, and I was able to carry the code the last few steps to get there. I am also very proud of the work I did with this project, because I think I faithfully preserved the integrity of the original, instead of ripping out parts that didn't work and effectively starting over. I am also proud of the work I did to help my project partner understand the jQuery file and how it works. I am an amplifier in most aspects of my life, and it is nice to see that I can somewhat apply that to being a programmer, as well.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My participation in the overall Turing community has been more sparse than I would like, but I believe I have made a few valuable contributions. 

First, I have been very open about my mental health status while at Turing. In the first few weeks, I demonstrated what my self-care kit was and did a simple explanation of each part, in order to help others see how easy a self-care kit is to make and how valuable it can be in high stress environments. After that, several people have talked to me about how they appreciated me being open about my mental health status; Some people had struggles of their own, and weren't comfortable with being open about it, but did appreciate that I put mental health concerns on the radar, so to speak; Others knew people who struggled, and found my openness helpful and refreshing.

In addition to being a known quanity in regards to my mental health, I've also brought attention to how people like me might be affected by website design, use of new technologies (particularly AR and VR), and the structure of classes at Turing. This has led to several conversations with other students, ranging in scope from the morality of having PTSD-inducing VR experiences even available to how to make mental health treatment resources more accessible and easier to find. I have also given the instructors some feedback pertaining to the structure of some of the lessons that tripped me up, in the hopes that it might help anyone in the following cohorts who are trying to take on Turing with Social Anxiety/Depression/PTSD.

Second, I have been working on making a hydra test for the mythical-creatures javascript-foundations challenges. It will hopefully help future students understand how to iterate over an array of objects within a constructor function. I am currently taking in feedback on it, and will fine-tune and adjust it, before ultimately submitting a pull request.

Third, I have tried to help others learn as soon as I felt my own understanding was stable. When my cohort was working on Number Guesser, I helped several people find and fix syntax errors that tripped-up their otherwise-working code, and I helped some people understand that if we want to change any values from the original ones when the page loads we have to do so in an event listener. When we were working on Static Comp 2, I helped several people fix wonky flexbox behaviour so that their cards would row-fill from the left. While working on 2DoBox-Pivot, I tried to help my group partner understand how the original jQuery worked and how my proposed adjustments would fix some of the problems while maintaining as many of the original design choices as possible. In these last weeks, I have also gone over Direwolf and Sphinx with some of my cohort-mates who were having trouble completing one or two tests.

For the next module, I intend to contribute more to the Turing community, by pairing as much as possible with the incoming cohort, and by leading meditation sessions.
