# Jessica Erickson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I set out to work as much as possible with other people and to refine what I learned from Module 1.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jessica-Erickson/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This was the project that really helped me to develop my strategy of taking a large assignment and breaking it down into smaller pieces that I could solve one bit at a time. When I started, I was only worried about writing the tests the we were given in the assignment. After that, I focused on passing the first test for the first method. After I had that passed, I accounted for edge cases, wrote the tests for those, then moved on to the next method. This process has served me very well since this assignment, and I have been able to apply it to other things that aren't Turing projects, too.

PASS

#### (Weatherly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jessica-Erickson/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

I really enjoy React; It makes intuitive sense to me and requires a planning structure that I like. When I learned that I was to do this pair-project on my own, I was shocked and a bit terrified. Then, I started applying the process I developed during Complete-Me and reached out to my cohort-mates for help. I honestly can't believe I got as far as I did, and I definitely wouldn't have gotten that far without the help of my peers.

PASS

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jessica-Erickson/game-time)
* [Playable Game](https://jessica-erickson.github.io/game-time/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project was the most difficult project for me yet, because I felt like my project partner was far ahead of me in terms of programming ability. He was able to take a task and hammer out the code for it in the time it would take me to look up a prototype method in the MDN docs. So, for this project, I had to overcome my impostor syndrome and PTSD in order to get it done. I did this by constantly talking to my project partner, to check-in on what he thought of the division of the workload and what his expectations were for working in a group. Since my group partner was willing to have these conversations, I was able to actually learn from him how to just code without planning. I don't like it as much as my meticulous planning, but his process of throwing out code and seeing what works has helped me get unstuck on both Complete-Me and Weatherly.

PASS

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This inning, I have supported the Turing community primarily by supporting the incoming cohort. I went to the New Student Welcome event in order to show that the new students were indeed welcome. I have continuously reached out and supported students in FE Mod 1, both in the form of pairing and regularly checking in with them. I have also worked to connect people from the 1806 cohort to the 1808 cohort, through learning about the new students and cluing them into who they have things in common with in our cohort.

In terms of supporting my own cohort, I have tried to be as encouraging and helpful as I can. I listen to my classmates in order to confirm what they already understand. I reach out to those I see struggling with impostor syndrome more than the material to remind them that they belong here. I voice the struggles I have, so that the instructors know if a lesson plan or teaching style needs to be adjusted, and so that my more reserved classmates know that they are not alone if they struggle with the same thing. I explain my problem solving process whenever I am asked to and share my discoveries so that each project is that much better. I have pushed back on in-cohort criticisms when they are not helpful or timely. I have also started going to meet-ups and sharing what I discover there with my classmates, so that it is less intimidating for them to go as well.

As far as supporting the larger Turing community, I have participated in the choir posse, the imposter's lunch, the mindfulness posse, the Joan Clark Society, the pod-cast, and the Code and Show competition. I have helped out with Try Coding weekends when I have had the opportunity to do so. I have also made a point of trying to put away clean dishes in the morning so that people can grab clean cups for coffee, instead of trying to determine whether or not the dishwasher is clean. Otherwise, I check-in with and greet the people I know, and act friendly towards the people I don't.

For the next inning, I plan to continue all of the ways I have previously supported my cohort and Turing, as well as becoming the SAB representative for my cohort.
