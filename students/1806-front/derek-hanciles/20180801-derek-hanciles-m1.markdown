# Derek Hanciles - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

With this being my second time going this module, I definitely highten expectations for myself. After completing the portfolio defense and going through all projects from the previous module, A light bulb went off in my head and finally got the big picture of all the projects. Once it became apperent to me that I'd be repeating the module, my focus then pivoted to how I would approach the retake. Realizing the new challeneges each project presented, my goal shifted to completely all of the projects, but also coming away with what the big picture focus of each project was, and not sacrificing my learning experience by simply pushing to finish all projects. I'm posistive that I did not finish all my projects last time around and definitely left all evals frustrated. This time around I developed all static comps and projects, except for one to completetion. In conjunction to this I came away from every project with a grasp on the new concepts that were being applied, but my ability to execute and talk out code had significantly improve. I say all that to say this, my goals for this mod were to complete each challenge/project and rebuild my shakey foundation for a solidified, significantly more stable foundation which I can now use to learn higher and more difficult concepts. 

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

Upon completion of this module I have now come away with a stronger understanding of all concepts and now have the ability to apply them and take each further. I am no way complacent and know that I still have tons of work, and more reps to put in. Based on my development in this module I passed the end of this module and I am ready to move on to module 2. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

On this individual project I used the new approach and better understanding I developed over our 2 week intermission. I was able to push myself to implement phase 4 of this project and I had a lot of fun doing it!

#### Number Guesser 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dhanciles/1806-Number_Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is a game that randomly generates a number between 1 - 100.
The user can start the game by attempting to correctly guess the random number generated.
It is also possible for the user to set their own range between 1 - 100 in given inputs, submit the range to the game, and a new random number will be generated. (example: User sets minimum range to 30 and maximum to 60, the game will now be based off a random number generated between 30 - 60.)
Upon a correct guess in the new specified range, the minimum is then decreased by 10, and the maximum is increased by 10. (example: After correctly guessing a number between 30 - 60, the users new range will be 20 - 70.)

 - Nice job following spec; make sure that when you add things in (range inputs), they provide a good UI
 - I love that you were tackling iteration 4 - I think you are super closeðŸ’ª
 - Like we talked about, I'd recommend planning out your design before coding draw your wireframes, label variables, event listeners, functions, etc. so you have a clear vision of the flow of entire app. I think this will help with those couple of spots where you were calling functions in places you didn't want/need to be.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My focus on all of my paired projects was to actually get to know who I was working with so I could better understand their workflow, and better develop relationships. I put pressure on myself to make sure all projects reached final phase of completetion, but I did not want my partners to bear that pressue. The goal was to work together and help each other get better, and I definitely achieved this goals on all projects. Also had way more fun because I understood what I was doing and just enjoyed the process of developing and launching a project way more this time around.

I really appreciated how hardworking you were during the project. You completed the media queries solo after spending a few hours on them on a night we were both pretty tired and never gave up trying to make the project as good as possible before the deadline. You were also very open to new ideas and technologies, like using Waffle.io for project management. You leveraged your existing knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to speed us through early parts of the project. And all of our effort and teamwork paid off into the best eval ever. You were also really flexible with scheduling and meeting remotely, which I appreciated - especially with my tardiness and few technical difficulties on Sunday over Slack. For coaching, the only things I can think of would getting more familiar with Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts and upping your typing speed to be a little quicker during driver / navigator sessions. Maybe revisit those prework www.typing.io sessions and challenge yourself to get a higher WPM once a week in the JS/jQuery. I also just Googled 'sublime text tutorial' and this website popped up: https://sublimetutor.com/ specifically for shortcuts. I'm going to check it out, too

#### IdeaBox

A application/website meant to a save ideas and assign different qualities to the ideas built with JavaScript. Local Storage also must be implemented to allow ideas to persist on web page, post session.

Evaluator - Travis Rollins 
- Work on using ids on inputs instead of classes for query selecting
- Moving scripts at the end of the dom tree
- Keep working on consistency of css styles and organization
- Good job structuring javascript and organization of globalvariables,
eventlisteners, and functions.
- No more using alerts! =)
- Good job breaking out functions into their own single responsibilities
- Nice job using local storage
- Use event delegation for appended items
- Try using an array next time for qualities and moving up the quality

I appreciated your drive to get our project done and that we were able to put aside our differences to have a good evaluation. I would challenge you to reflect on the manner in which you communicate with your partner. Listening to your partner and allowing them to contribute to the project no only solidifies your learning but that of your partner as well.

Evaluator - Louisa Barrett
- make sure the layout works on mobile/small screens, currently is a lil broken on small screens
- looks good on large screens, just a few fine tuning details around spacing, disabled states, and clearly communicating what is a clickable thing vs text
- make sure to prioritize ARIA
- CSS still needs a tidy pass, there are a few properties that aren't doing anything
- missing the closing HTML tag!
- overall, well done!
- CSS and HTML could use a last clean up pass to catch final details

I appreciated how open communication was and our workflow went smoothly when we were working together.  I also think Waffle was a pretty cool tool to get a sneak peak at for possible use in the future.   I think we had similar work drive and were able to push out new features for our project with ease.  I think one thing you could work on is troubleshooting your code.  When things don't work right the first time, it seemed like sometimes you were somewhat lost on what steps to take to start attempting to fix it.  I don't think this really set us back at all and overall it is a somewhat minor thing to focus on.  You were a great partner and I think we did a pretty awesome job overall on the project.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

As someone who is repeating this module, one of the best ways I could have an impact on my community was by building relationships with new comers in mod 1 expericing Turing for the first time. I was able to be a leader, and be there for people when they needed to speak about the difficulties of this envionment and the pressures they would begin to feel. I feel like I had a great impact on our mod, but also maintained realtionships with people in higher mods to get a feel for how they were doing. Also I reached out to quite a few back end students and they were a joy to get to know better and know their experience at Turing as well.
