# Tanj McMeans-M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to fufill all learning obligations required of students in the Front End Mod 1 course, including:
-increasing my technical vocabulary and ability to talk about code in a way that demonstrates my understanding of programming 
-develop better skills in writing html and css in a way that is efficient, DRY, accessible for screen readers and optimized for rendering speed in web browsers
-expand my ability to write effecient, DRY Javascript/jQuery and use problem solving skills to successfully solve algorithms
-learn creative design principles including typography, color and gestalt rules and apply them to projects
-gain a better understanding of the tech industry in general, including the requirements of developers on engineering teams
-grow as a pair programmer and teammate on class projects

Notes/What To Work On:
some fine tuning layout details left over
good work divvying up the work, giving each other space to work on areas solo and regrouping to work on things together when you got stuck or needed a second set of eyes.

Functional Expectations:
partially into phase 3

(feedback to me)
Sara: I appreciate how you helped me to understand the need to break down pieces of code into small steps with frequent checks. When we set agreements for meeting times and they were not held and/or the timeframe was extended without mutual agreement, it impacted me by missing out on having the sense that we had a shared project trajectory. It would have been helpful to have these times honored. 

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TMcMeans/Idea_Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

An application for creating ideas that can be rated and saved to localStorage and persisted on page reload. 

(evaluation comments)
Notes/What To Work On:
Nice job using local storage and crushing a bunch of the functionality!
Taking it the next step up, trying storing the data in an array rather than as separate identities
Making buttons bigger on smaller screens
Try not to use flex on div which is acting as body (use grid or something else on body)
Cleanup on html and css commented out lines
Super great job on refactored css and structuring it well
Experiment using array prototypes over for loops
Try putting the logic where you append cards into one function

Functional Expectations:
Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

Notes/What To Work On:
Great naming conventionsðŸŽ‰
Loved that both teammates were fully able to explain entire project. Also the love and supportive space you created for each otherðŸ’— _ Fully functionalðŸ’ª
Start using array prototypes instead of for loops!
Consider organization - where event listeners are, order of functions, etc.

(feedback to me)
I appreciate that you spoke with me so plainly about your goals and what the agenda was for each day. This really helped foster a trusting relationship and ultimately allowed us to accomplish more. Keep measuring twice and doing once! While discussing the scope of our work to be done each day there were times where you would come back with more than we had discussed being completed. This sometimes created extra work for me as I had already been working on the section of project and had to go back to delete and then integrate the new code. I think it is okay to go beyond what was originally discussed but let your partner know so duplicative efforts can be avoided.

## D: Professional Skills

This is an overview of my Gear Up sessions. 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

### Gear Up
##### (Health and Wellness)

I think that this gear up was one of the most important sessions for understanding how to take care of myself during the duration of this program. We learned a lot about self care topics, including getting enough rest, sleep, eating healthy and staying accountable to my wellness with the help of classmates. 

### Gear Up
#### (Code 2.0) 

As a black woman, I really appreciate being part of this Gear Up session on diversity. I also think it was really cool to hear from Turing instructors and presenters that diversity is important to them, and that tech is not a meritocracy. 

### Gear Up
#### (Escaping Your Echo Chamber)

This was a really cool session about escaping echo chambers by the Mod1 students, it was awesome to hear other's perspectives on sensitive political opinions. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I think that I have been a valuable member of the Turing community by signing up to pair with upper mod students, being part of community events and generally having a positive attitude (when not stressing over projects).
