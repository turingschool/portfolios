------------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think that I passed the end of module assessment. I think I did well on the challenges of the week (DOM manipulation and mythical creatures), as well as the personal and group projects. I also have a solid understanding of CSS grid, and how to structure a layout overall. Additionally, I have a good grasp of the foundational JavaScript and jQuery topics that we went over in this mod. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned a lot while working on these individual and group projects. I was able to learn more about myself particularly through the group projects. I think that overall I did well on both the individual and group projects.

# Static Comp 1

* [Static Comp 1](https://github.com/cierrajw/cjw-comp-challenge-1)
* [Static Comp 1 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

### (description):

Static comp 1 was my very first static comp challenge, where I was really able to utilize grid and flex box and start to understand how they work. 

### (evaluation comments):

Great feedback, just could space the arrows on my side image better, and fix the < 320 media query alignment.

# Static Comp 2

* [Static Comp 2](https://github.com/cierrajw/cjw-comp-challenge-2)
* [Static Comp 2 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

### (description):

Static comp 2 was an exploration in more advanced grid topics such as auto fit and minmax. 

### (evaluation comments):

I did a great job with aligning things on the page as well as media queries, just could work on fonts to really make the page "pop"

# Static Comp 3

* [Static Comp 3](https://github.com/cierrajw/cw-comp-challenge-3)
* [Static Comp 3 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

### (description):

Static comp 3 was definitely a learning experience for me, and a challenge (mostly in patience, and media queries). I think I did a great job overall mimicking the original comp, particularly in desktop mode. I also explored other things like creating a bargraph with Canvas and also a jQuery toggle for the side menu. I feel that I have a great idea of how to structure a page by looking at it and planning it out, using CSS grid. 


### (evaluation comments):

I did a great job with structuring the page and my code, and I could do better with media queries as far as a liquid layout with the complex comp. I just have to watch a video or two, becuase I understand grid and flex pretty well, but the media queries got a little "squirely". 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were fun, and I was able to learn a lot from others, and teach others as well. The group projects were a great learning/growing experence as far as how I see myself as a developer now and in the future (at future jobs/teams, etc.).

# Linked List

[Linked List](https://github.com/cierrajw/linked-list)
* [Linked List Assignmentt](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

# Idea Box

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/cierrajw/idea-box)
* [Idea Box Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### (description):

Idea box was a next level exploration of JavaScript (particularly in terms of learning things like local storage), and I was able to really use and start to understand jQuery. 

### Evaluation

## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

### CSS
* consider moving element selectors to the top
* Love those organizational comments
* consider using classes more

### JS
* Great style and naming conventions
* Use constructor functions!
* Separate the data model from the markup - the way things are displayed will always change
* Think about having a qualities array

### Git
* Nice work!

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Exceptional Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
* Exceptional Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
* Exceptional Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology. Developer is confident and comfortable speaking to and answering questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

* [2DoBox-Pivot](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

### (description):

The 2DoBox-Pivot was a project that allowed me to really solidify some concepts such as local storage and JSON, as well as grasp jQuery even better. I was able to help my partner understand some concepts, and I was able to see him become a more confident programmer, especially with the help of his mentor.

- nice use of transitions when filtering cards
- good github workflow, make sure you're writing clear commit messages, some were a little unclear
- nice use of ARIA
- missing closing HTML tag
- still some unused/unneeded CSS, still could use a clean up refactor pass
- JS is tidy and well factored
- Fantastic use of terminology and really, really good at speaking about your code and the decisions that went into it
- really good team work! So awesome to see a team that worked so well together and enjoyed working together.
- REALLY GOOD JOB!!!!!

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community):

I think that I supported the larger Turing community in a couple of ways. One way is that I was able to help my fellow classmates who were in need of a push in terms of understanding their projects, or in terms of motivation. Another way is that I made sure to do my part as far as cleaning/maintaining our classroom space, and cleaning up after myself in the kitchen.

------------------

## Final Review

Overall, I believe that my first module at Turing was a solid run, and it was a progressive learning experience. On each project I learned more and more and gained more confidence in JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, HTML, and my general problem solving and teamwork skills.
