# Chris Chateau - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To develop a strong basis in HTML and CSS while improving my rudimentary understanding of JavaScript. I also hope to develop relationships in my time at Turing in order to build a network of contacts in the tech community.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 2.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I found Mod 1 to be both challenging and enjoyable. I take pride in each project I submitted. I am eager to see what Mod 2 holds and feel that I am ready to advance.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I immersed myself in each one of these projects. At no point did I stop working when I felt like I'd done 'just enough' to receive a satisfactory score. I found them each to be very engaging and continued to improve them up until the due date.

#### Number Guesser

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Description
* Do you remember that project IdeaBox?.. We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox. You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I completed two pair projects this module and enjoyed the collaboration process both times. Looking back, I feel like my JavaScript abilities increased greatly between Linked-List and IdeaBox

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Description
* Now it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

#### Evaluation

* [Linked-List Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/linked-list/chris-cierra.md)

* Cierra's Feedback: ```Hi Chris! I had a great time working with you. You were very persistent in trying to figure out how to add features and learn new things. I really appreciate your refactoring efforts, and how you made the code much more organized and readable. The only 'coaching' feedback I have is that we both could have had a more systematic approach to the project,  using apps like waffle.io or Trello, etc. to organize tasks as a way to avoid some conflicts. Other than that your collaboration style was very supportive and productive. Overall a great partnership and you did a great job!```

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Description
* Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

#### Evaluation

* [IdeaBox Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/casey-chris.md)

* Casey's Feedback: ```It was a pleasure to work on IdeaBox with Chris. He is a great developer with a quick mind. Our working styles were similar, and we completed the project without any interpersonal problems. I appreciated Chris' even-keeled demeanor and patience. My understanding of JavaScript improved ten-fold because of his willingness to slow his pace along the way and make sure I understood the concepts we were working on before moving on. Chris would make a natural and productive addition to any team, and I'd be happy to work with him again. Chris and I made a natural pair, but one thing we could have done better is share the load of who's 'driving' when we worked together. He understood the concepts more quickly and I would have benefited from having 'driven' a bit more so I could go a bit more slowly and digest the concepts at my speed.```

## D: Professional Skills

 * Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

 * In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community.

 * Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and gain awareness of the issues preventing tech from being an inclusive space.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have enjoyed developing relationships with my cohort-mates as well as students in the higher mods. Everyone I've interacted with has been incredibly supportive and helpful. People have even walked past me at pairing stations and checked-in to see if there's anything I was struggling with. As my coding abilities progress through the Mod's, I hope to repay this gesture to incoming students. I was also amazed the the supportive DM's I received from classmates and even people in higher mods regarding my static comps. It's an inspiring community to be a part of. I admittedly have not taken part in some of the recent community events as I'm hyper-focused on my own work, but hope change this going forward.
