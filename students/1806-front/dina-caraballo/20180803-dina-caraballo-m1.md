# Dina Caraballo - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with no prior coding experience and very limited knowledge. My goal was to learn as much as possible and gain all the tools that I will need to be successful in later mods. After weeks of work, stress, and the emotional roller-coaster that is Turing, I now feel prepared to advance to the next module. I believe that I have a solid foundational knowledge of html, css, and javascript.

#### IdeaBox - Paired with Derek Hanciles

* https://github.com/bottd/Linked-List
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

For this project, we were required to build an application where a user could input a title and body of an idea and create an idea card to be upvoted/downvoted/deleted. We were also required to utilize local storage.

## Student: Derek Hanciles & Dina Caraballo
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Work on using ids on inputs instead of classes for query selecting
* Moving scripts at the end of the dom tree
* Keep working on consistency of css styles and organization
* Good job structuring javascript and organization of global variables, event listeners, and functions.
* No more using alerts! =)
* Good job breaking out functions into their own single responsibilities
* Nice job using local storage
* Use event delegation for appended items
* Try using an array next time for qualities and moving up the quality 

## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

## D: Professional Skills
During mod 1, we were required to attend several professional development sessions designed to prepare us for working as software developers; assist us in developing our identities as software developers; alert us to gender/racial gaps and trends; and, assist us in developing tools and strategies for job interviews.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

In this session, we discussed managing stress and overcoming obstacles. This session made me more aware of how I handle stress and the things that I need to put in place to make sure that I am taking care of myself. After this session, I made it a priority to get at least 6 hours of sleep and use a pomodoro timer when working.

### Gear Up
#### Code 2.0

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md
In this session, we discussed diversity and biases. I was very happy that these subjects were breifly discussed as I will b entering a workplace that may-may not be diverse, after Turing. I am happy that Turing is becoming more diverse and that these topcis were addressed. As always, I reflected on my own biases and how they impact my decisions.
-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I was nominated by my instructors to be on the Student Advisory Board. I attended weekly meetings and served as a representative of my cohort in order to improve the culture and community at Turing. In addition, I was responsible for running our cohort retros (along with my fellow SAB rep) and taking our concerns back to the SAB in order to have them voiced and possibly effect positive change. Because of this responsibility, I also felt the need to check in with several students who appeared to be struggling with acclimating to Turing.
