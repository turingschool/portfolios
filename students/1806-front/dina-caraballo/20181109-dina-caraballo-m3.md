# Dina Caraballo - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this mod was to struggle more independently. In the past two mods, I asked for help as soon as I got stuck. While I got a lot of experience pairing with some amazing (and patient) developers, which is a skill in itself; I wanted to push myself farther to make more progress. I wanted to be job-ready and feel more confident as a developer by the end of mod 3. I feel that I have successfully accomplished my goal!

## A: End of Module Assessment

According to instructors, I passed all end of module assessments.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module, we were assigned two individual projects.

### Projects
* HeadCount2.0
* Binary Challenge
-----------------------

#### HeadCount2.0

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/HeadCount2.0
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0

For this project, we were required to build an application that compared district stats from across Colorado.

## Student: Dina
## Evaluator: None
## Notes/What To Work On:

- This project was ungraded.

-----------------------

#### Binary Challenge

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/MarvelMatch
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html

For this project, we were required to design and build an application using an assigned API and target demographic. The API that I was assigned was the Marvel Comics API. The target demographic that I was assigned was first year college students.

## Student: Dina
## Evaluator: Will Mitchell
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Work on testing redux.
- Continue to practice using redux to solidify skills.
- Very solid project.

## Scores
### Specification Adherence
* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a complete mastery of React architecture.

### Testing
* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.

### Redux Architecture
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

### Routing
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.

-----------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
* SWAPI-Box
* Movie Tracker
-----------------------

This module, we were assigned one paired and one group project.

#### SWAPI-Box - Paired with Alex Ela
## Evaluator: Christie Lynam
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice job!

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/SWAPI-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html

For this project, we were required to retrieve data from the Star Wars API to be displayed in our application.

## Scores
### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application completes all 6 iterations.

### Code Quality
* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design
* 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### React Router
* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### Testing
* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Wireframes
* Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

### PropType Implementation
* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Workflow
* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

-----------------------

#### Movie Tracker - Grouped with Mark Pearyer & Alex Rau
## Evaluator: Christie Lynam

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/Movie-Tracker-Frontend
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker

For this project, we were required to build a application that retrieved data from the MovieDB API and displayed the information.

### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.
  
### Project Professionalism
* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing
* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture
* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing
* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills
During mod 3, we were required to attend several professional development sessions designed to prepare us for working as software developers; help us to continue developing our own narrative for job-hunting; aid us in giving and receiving feedback; and, provide us with project management tools.

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I participated on a panel during a try coding event for teachers. On this panel, I shared my experiences while at Turing and (hopefully) helped some curious teachers to take the leap. In addition, I worked as a representative of Turing at Denver Startup Week answering questions about the program.
