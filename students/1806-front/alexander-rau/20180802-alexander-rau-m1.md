# (Alexander Rau) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I really set out to learn the material.  Computers are not something that I've had a lot of access to, and, thus, programming is never something I thought I would have the opportunity to do.  I was really excited to get this opportunity, and I was not going to waste it.  Learning-wise, I decided I was not going to worry about whether or not I understood the concepts or the code right away.  My gameplan was to act on as much of the advice that I received from people who have been through this Mod previously as I could and just make sure to, at a base-level, put in the hours.  This method really worked for me, as I definitely feel I have a good handle on HTML, CSS, and, my biggest struggle, JS. The most helpful advice I got from upper mod-ers was to pair often, and I did that.  I attacked that pairing calendar several times a week, and made sure I was DM-ing anoyone I signed up with at least a day in advance.  I also got a lot out of my mentor, with whom I have weekly meetings, and I scheduled with Pat when he was available, as well.  I made sure, in my meetings with my mentor, that I was not afraid to ask any questions and express any concerns or thoughts I had about the work I was doing.  I also apporached pairing with this attitude, as well.  Outside of pairings and mentors, I aproached this learning process as if I were exercising a muscle: the only way to get better is put in the reps.  I believe all of this has helped me greatly, as I have turned in all of my projects in a state where I was proud of the finished product, and I also feel like I have a much better handle on the material than I did when I started.  For me, my progress from then to now is palpable.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is an overview of the solo projects I completed this Mod, including: Number Guesser and all 3 Static Comp assignments:


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was my first major assignment, besides the basic, introductory website I had to create in the pre-mod work.  This introduced us to using JS (specifically vanilla), and it was also my first time recreating a page from a comp using CSS.  In this project, my code would generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the user can submit a guess in the input field.  Then, the computer would tell them if they were too low or high from the randomly generated number, and the user would keep submitting guesses until they guess the number.  In my game, I put in contingencies for if the user guessed outside of 1-100, or if the user typed in something that was not a number at all.

Evaluation comments:

- be sure to give proper indentation for my HTML

- review JS for refactoring possibilities (for example: I had a particularly long "if" statement)

- be nice to myself!

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/ajr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The Static Comp projects were assignments where we would receive a picture comp and were told to recreate it using only HTML and CSS.  We were allowed creative license with color and images, but the basic structure and functionality of the page should be the same.  This was my big intro to making a responsive web page (using Media Queries), and the first time I used Flexbox and Grid.  With this comp, I experiemented with color by using a cooler, more earthy color palette.  I also included aria-labels in my HTML.


#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/ajr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This second static comp assignment was more practice with CSS Flexbox, Grid and responsiveness.  We were given another comp to recreate, and we were, again, allowed creative freedom with the colors and images.  As with the previous comp, I used my own color palette, and I experimented to create a color palette that was pleasing and sleek/understated to the user.  Here, too, I included aria-labels in my HTML.


#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/ajr-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This third static comp assignment was, again, a comp picture, which we had to recreate using only HTML and CSS.  This one had many more moving parts that the last two, so I stuck more strictly to the comp, and concentrated my creative freedom on what I was going to do with each box when the screen was squished.  To me, this was the most fun part of the project, as it was like building and re-building a puzzle each time.  I used Grid quite a bit more here than in the previous two projects, having to reassign grid rows and columns at each Media break-point, and I used Flexbox on pretty much every element.  This is also the project where I really took advantage of hover states and put attractive, functional hover states on every clickable button.  In this comp, I tried to make my HTML aria-labels as conversational and intuitive as possible.  All of my buttons include a "Click here to..." type-sentence, my images of graphs state, briefly, what information is showing in the graph (and not just that it's "a graph"), etc.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here is an overview of the partner projects I completed this Mod, including: Linked List, Idea Box and 2DoBox Pivot:


#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/Linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was the second major project in this Mod, the first where we were working with a partner.  In this project, we were to create a website with input fields for users to add a link they wanted to save, and a title for that link.  Upon submission, the link with assigned title would populate as a clickable card on the right side of the screen.  Successive submissions would appear below the previous ones to make a list.  Each list item has a delete button which would remove it from the page, and a "Read" button to mark it as "Read", so it would stand apart from the unread links.  We also included live counters to count how many read and unread links are on the page.

Evaluation comments:

HTML:

 - loved that we used aria labels
 
 - need to further polish our indentation for HTML (per style guides)
 
 CSS:
 
 - we should consider organizing our CSS in organizational blocks with labeling comments (we just did strict alphabetical order)
 
 JS:
 
 - need to further work on our indentation for JS (per style guides)
 
 - suggested leveraging "or" (`||`) statements to assist in cleaning up some of our longer JS sections
 

* [Evaluation scores] (https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/linked-list/alexander-alexander.md)

Feedback to me - Alex's feedback to me stated that:

`I really appreciate how communicative you were during our project and how you didn't let any long stretches of time pass without checking in about it.  I also appreciated how proactive you were in getting help from other people. This enabled us to move forward even when we felt totally lost in the project.  I also appreciate how thorough you are in correcting notation like () and {}, especially since I seem to have a problem with forgetting them sometimes!  Lastly, you were very good at identifying exactly what was happening in our Javascript. You're good at it, never forget it! I recommend that you spend some time getting more comfortable with using more responsive units of measurement in CSS, such as rems and ems. I remember you saying that you felt frustrated by rems at one point, which I'm sure you could fix with a few hours of practice and pairing.`


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This was the third major Mod project, second partner project.  In this project, we had to create a website with 2 inputs, where the user enters in a title and a description for an "idea" they want to save.  Then, the appropriately titled "idea" would append to the page below the submission boxes.  Any ideas added after the fact would print above the previously entered ideas, and the user can add as many as they want.  Each idea card has a delete button, and button to up or down vote a "quality" rating.  Also, this was the first project where we were to persist the data on the page, so that the saved idea cards will still be there when you re-enter/refresh the page.  We did this using local storage.  We had our functionaltiy with local storage also save the "quality" ranking, as they were set with the upvote/downvote buttons, and we had the delete button erase the deleted item from local storage.  With this project, Justin and I decided to use jQuery for the first time.

Evaluation comments:

- keep working on making sure we commit and make new git branches more often

- good comp design, but we could add extra media queries to address button sizes

- great HTML structure, but be careful of using multiple `h1`s, and try using `<span>`s to style specific words

- nice job on using aria-labels in forms, try adding them to buttons and input fields, as well

- nice structure and organization of styles!

- work on drying up CSS more (in example: using groupings of classes for elements that have similar properties)

- work on using classes multiple times in HMTL

- nice job breaking-out global variables, event listeners and function declarations

- make sure to be consistent in whether event listeners are using anonymous functions or function declarations

- nice use of contructor functions!

- good use of terminology when describing your code!

- good job using only one function to append ideas to the page

- experiment using one array in local storage to store all saved ideas, instead of storing each idea as their own item

- experiment using array prototypes over `for` loops

- nice work using an array for the quality values, but experiment storing the index of a quality from the array in the constructor function, as opposed to storing each quality index position as its own variable

- nice use of local variables!

* [Evaluation scores] (https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/alexander-justin.md)

Feedback to me - Justin's feedback to me stated that:

`I love that you took the project so seriously. Talking out loud every step of the way and keeping the communication to an all time high. You putting in as many hours as you did made me want to keep working and get as much done as possible. You are a super animated dude, which I don't mind at all, it kept our works session hilarious and light, while productive, but for someone else i could see how it could be counter intuitive with a different sense of humor.`


#### 2DoBox - Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This was the final major Mod project, as well as the final partner project.  This project consisted of taking a version of the previous, "Idea Box" project and pivoting it to the specs for this new 2DoBox site.  We had to take the existing Idea Box code we were provided and refactor it to proper functionality and the style guides, as well as to certain added specifications: no global variables in JS, all JS functions must be 8 lines or under (excepting the template literal), line lengths kept within 80 characters, proper indentation, smart and concise comments (when necessary), little to no duplication in code (especially with JS - DRY principle).  Then, other than the original Idea Box functionality, we had to add new functionality to the site.  We had to upgrade the "quality" levels to "importance" levels, dealing with 5 items, instead of 3, as well as adding buttons where a user can sort by the specific importance level they select.  Also, we had to add a "Task Complete" button to each Task card, so that they would be distinct from uncompleted tasks.  Then, on page load, only uncompleted tasks would load up, and, to view the ones that were marked as "Complete", you would have to click the corresponding button.  Also, the list of Task cards would be limited to 10, with another button to click to see the rest.  Plus, there was a search bar to search for specific Tasks.  Cole and I also used jQuery for this project, and we expanded our aria-labels to make them more conversational and specific in tone.  We also used the local storage method Travis mentioned in my previous eval, where all items are stored in one array of objects, instead of multiple separate entries.

Evaluation comments:

- nice UI details!

- filter/search bar is misbehaving

- very well executed UI, good work!

- make sure to maximize screen space on small screens, the buttons get a little narrow

- good use of ARIA!

- HTML is really tidy and clean!

- a couple of CSS properties aren't doing much and could be removed

- JS is very tidy, good job really hitting the 8-line function rule!

- good at talking through and speaking to the code

* [Evaluation scores] (https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/to-do-box/alexander-cole.md)

Feedback to me - Cole's feedback to me stated that:

`Alex was a great partner for 2DoBox. Because we had taken slightly different approaches to IdeaBox, we were able to fill in each others' gaps in 2DoBox and move along quickly to complete the project a day and a half early. Alex was great at communicating his needs and expectations early and consistently throughout the project. He also figured out how to apply the .filter() Array prototype method to many functions in our project and took on the implementation of the 'mark as complete' feature, completing it in a couple of hours. Alex was always flexible with how we met and our working styles complemented each other well. The only coaching feedback I can think of is that Alex occasionally thinks aloud and interrupts mid-sentence while trying to figure out a problem. It didn't happen often, and trying to keep in mind slowing down to listen while problem solving will aid in partnering and pairing in the future.`


## D: Professional Skills
Here is an overview of the 3 Gear-Up/PD sessions I attended during Mod 1, including: 

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

In this session, we learned about the different types of stress, and healthy ways to deal and cope with them.  Each different type of stress commands different coping methods, and, from how I understand it, the most important thing is to be aware of how you are feeling and why.  This was early on in the Mod, and our classwork had not realy ramped-up, yet, so I was not sure what to expect.  However, this discussion on stress early on helped me out in being ready for what was to come.  I also remember them talking about building your own self-care kit, and one of my fellow Cohort-mates sharing hers.  It was enlightening and informative.  For me, particularly, I have used music as an effective coping mechanism for stress during the Mod, and always make sure to have headphones with me.


#### (Code 2.0/Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

In this session, we had an in-depth discussion about our stories, where we come from as potential programmers, and how important it is to have an inclusive and diverse collection of those stories in the tech workplace and industry.  We also watched parts from a documentary called: "Debugging the Gender Gap" that specifically spoke to the issues of women entering the tech industry.  This session was pretty important to me because, as someone who came from a more poor background, computers and technology were not a luxury my family could usually afford, and becoming a programmer was never something I was even told was a possibility for me.  It was encouraging and enlightening to hear everyone else's stories, and I love the idea of making the tech industry as diverse and well-rounded a place as possible.  Being exposed and living in a diverse group of peers makes one grow as a person, and this idea is incredibly important to me.  I see the good it has done for me, and the good it does for others.

#### (Why Emotional Intelligence Matters)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1806-inning/group5.md)

This was the week of Gear Ups, where we had rotating sessions.  The specific session I attended was all about Emotional Intelligence in the workplace and how it can aid you as a co-worker in a team.  We learned about different working styles and discussed how we get along together, including where we clash and where we gel.  I have always appreciated the value of emotional intelligence, and having this opportunity to learn more about it and have group discussions on the topic was engaging and informative.  Ideally, I would have liked more discussion, and less watching a video/splitting into groups to read different articles, but, overall, the group discussions we had on each section were worth it.  I especially liked the exercise where we split off into different corners of the room, to illustrate our different working styles, and were asked to analyze them.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Since I got here, I have wanted to take full advantage of the unique interactive community that Turing offers its students.  I have paired as often as possible, I attended demo nights, stayed after and assisted fellow Mod 1-ers with their work (as well as getting help with mine), took part in the Imposters group and, recently, I have volunteered to work a shift at the Turing table at the upcoming Taste of Ethiopia festival this Saturday.  As I move up through Mods, I want to keep this pace going, especially when it comes to the opportunity to help others who aren't as far along as I am.  This area, in particular, has been a struggle for me, personally, as I have trouble silencing that voice in my head that likes to say: "who are you to tell anyone how to do something?  What makes *you* an authority?".  This is not helpful, and I plan on overcoming it by making myself available for pairing with future Mod 1-ers as much as possible, as well as continuing to help classmates when needed.  I usually learn a lot, myself, out of these experiences, so this is definitely a muscle I wish to flex.
