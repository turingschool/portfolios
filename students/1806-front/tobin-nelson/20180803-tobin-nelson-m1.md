# Tobin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Initially upon starting Turing, my focus was on developing the habits and practice that will lead to success at Turing and as a developer. I worked to perfect my process over six weeks and ultimately have a better understanding of how I learn best. There have been many ups and downs but ultimately I feel success in that regard reflecting upon these 6 weeks. In addition, I worked to gain solid foundations in the technical skills we learn at Turing. The skills have slowly built upon each other. Finally, I have been eager to work through the pairing process and group work to improve my technical skills and become a better team-player.

## NumberGuesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Overview

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

* Awesome copying the comp.  Super clean.
* Taking it to the next step, adding aria roles/labels.
* Use cascading stylesheets effectively so you don't need multiple spans in your h1.
* Organize CSS based on element, class, id, etc.
* Grouping classes together that have similar rules/properties.
* Make sure functions in event listeners are consistent
* Cleaning up redundant code and moving them into their own functions
* Make sure to clean up logs

## Static Comp #1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/tn-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Feedback
* Fix image sizing at the largest screen size
* Watch sizing/spacing and margins around icons and text
* Crowded boxes can be refactored
* Watch for content getting too close to boundaries as we resize- add padding
* Picture on full screen doesn't fill- sizing of a background image

## Static Comp #2

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Overview
Now it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.
In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark


#### Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice job on lots of small commits
* Make more branches for each feature/bug
* great responsiveness 
* HTML structure is fantastic
* Add more aria roles and labels and use more semantic elements than div
* Nice organization of CSS and very well refactored
* Add more grouping for CSS
* Nice work with breaking out functionality into smaller functions
* Be consistent with either anonymous functions or function declarations for event listeners
* Experiment more with && and || operators and looking into truthy and falsy values

## IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/idea-box-TN-AK)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### Overview
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).
Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

### Notes/What To Work On:
#### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs
#### CSS
* pull duplicate declaration blocks into their own class ie. `small-button` that applies to all small buttons
* Love the smaccs
#### JS
* Work on naming conventions - no need to say data type but think about using plural words
* Think about having a qualities array
* Use constructor functions
* Always use braces and blocks for if/elsif/else statements
#### Git
* Would like to see more commits


### Functional Expectations
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

#### HTML

#### Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

#### CSS

#### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

### GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


#### DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### PAIRING

#### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### TERMINOLOGY

#### Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

### Partner Feedback
* from Ahmad: Tobin has a calm presence to him. Working with him was fun, he wanted to drive a lot and I appreciated that because it allowed me to navigate at HIS pace and not mine which was essential to us being on the same page. He grasped concepts as they came but when he struggled he would ask for clarification and again, that keeps us on the same page. My advice to him is to learn jQuery for DOM manipulation as opposed to fancy animations with the library, this would allow him to target specific elements with much shorter code than in VanillaJS. Definitely check out the "Learn jQuery in 15 min" video that I linked on the group page. It gives a good idea of what jQuery can do with the DOM. I had a great time pairing with him, his desire to completely get what he's doing before moving on is essential to growing as a developer and Id be happy to help with any questions that may arise in the future.



## 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Overview
Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…
We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.
You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

### Notes/What To Work On:
#### Git/Github
* Nice work! Seeing a lot of commits and good context
* Be more consistent with Capitalization and tense

#### HTML
* Use of aria labels to provide more context

#### CSS
* Avoid comma seperated selectors, use a more broad class instead
* Like the smaccs

#### JS
* Pull duplicate blocks into their own functions and pass arguments where necessary

### Partner Feedback
* From Mark: Great working with you, Tobin. You have a knack for learning things quickly. Great clarity in the beginning, during our DTR. I really appreciate that you were never idle during the project, you were always working on something. Looking forward to working with you again. This coaching feedback is not necessarily related to just this project. Do not be afraid to just try things out, just keep trying until something works. I hit a lot of walls in this project, due to trying things out but in the end we both learned how array prototype methods worked and jQuery methods worked. If we didn't try those methods out we would have never learned. 


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have really enjoyed being part of the community here. Everyone is so open and positive and I always strive to do the same. With our projects, I've tried to do everything to support my partners and in the class, I'm eager to help others when and where I can. One of the main things I have thought about is embracing the positive energy at Turing and use it to support everyone throughout a difficult process. I feel a part of the class and community, and I feel we can all lean on each other throughout this process. In addition, I have been excited to participate and attend outside of class activities such as demo nights, significant other events, and will be volunteering at the RailsBridge event Aug 4 at Turing.
