 ## Areas of Emphasis
 
I entered Mod 1 the second time around with the intent to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS andJavascript to have a solid foundation for moving forward.  I also wanted to make sure I could help out any students that were newer to programming particularly if they were frustrated or struggling.

 ## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
 My individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three static composition challenges.
 Number guesser is a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  The application generates a random number in the range and gives feedback based on if the user guess is too high, too low or correct.

 ## C: Group Work & Projects
 
 ### Projects

In this first mod, we had three group projects. They were Linked List, Idea Box, and 2DoBox Pivot. These projects put to test not only our technical skills, but also our partnering skills. It was just as important to work well with other people who may or may not share your strengths, weakness, or work styles as it was to complete the requirements.
  
 #### LinkedList

## Feedback from Partner
It was a pleasure being your partner for Linked LIst. From beginning to end, we communicated effectively and accommodated each others' goals and needs for the project. You were patient with me on Saturday when I got frustrated about GitHub (and now I am so glad we prioritized practicing Git/GitHub), and you allowed me to explore a bit when we were working on JavaScript even if you ultimately knew a better way of accomplishing the task I was working on. Thank you for the times when you made a point to notice and voice the things I had done well. Nice work making sure that we took breaks and always speaking up when you needed to take a walk. Lastly, thank you for taking the DTR seriously and sticking to it. Because of how thoroughly we discussed the questions in the DTR before beginning our project and how closely we ended up following it, I'm having difficulty coming up with any coaching feedback. We knew from the beginning what the other needed, and we stuck to that. I hope to work with Brandon again in the future.
 
 
 #### IdeaBox
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandido/Idea-Box)
 * [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
 
Description: Build an application for recording and archiving ideas. The user should input and store an idea and description and be able to search through, edit, delete and change the quality of each idea. This project focused on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface by ensuring that the ideas persist on page load.
 
## Student: Ben and Brandon
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- UI needs some polish, fonts aren't getting pulled in
- code has some verbose areas and missing functionality
- in a good place for a refactor

## Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Novice  Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Novice  Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time. 
 
## Feedback from Partner
I appreciate Brandon's ability to work through the steps and challenge ourselves to figuring out solutions. Brandon was flexible on time and easy to work with. Brandon could work on getting things to work first then refactoring later, but does a great job of logically working through steps! 


 #### 2doBox-Pivot
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/djcaraballo/2DoBox-Pivot)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
 
 Description: Inherit another groups IdeaBox, refactor CSS/jQuery and pivot the application from a list of ideas to a task list manager.

## Feedback from Partner
I appreciated and enjoyed being your partner. Your patience and calm energy made the work enjoyable as well. Even through times where we got stuck we were still able to step back and get back to neutral. Thank you for all of your hard work on our project! Take care of yourself. Don't let any other partners push you past your limits. This program needs more people like you to encourage others. Make sure you take care of yourself well enough to make it through this program.
 
 
 ## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)
 A very positive bonus to attending Turing is the emphasis on personal and professional development.  Well thought out sessions allow you to continue to develop as a whole person that can lead meaningful lives filled with purpose yet balanced with perspective.
 
 ### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)
 
 This was a very appropriate session to learn more about stress. Turing is stressful for everyone in their own way and in my case that certainly applied. During the middle of Mod 1 I had some unexpected stress occur and it helped to remember some of the technqiues from this session.  Moving forward I need to continue to be both aware and consistent in taking down time to meditate and exercise. 
 
 
 #### Code Debugging the Gender Gap
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)
 
 I believe this was an important session and enjoyed discussing and listening to different perspectives from my classmates and mod 3 students. The video we watched increased my awareness of the gender gap amongst programmers and the tech/science community at large. I think it will be important to always try to be empathetic to others that come from different backgrounds, genders and ethnicities than my own while also being mindfull of always respecting their abilities and contributions as professionals.
 
 #### Mental Health Apps
 
 This was a great session for me as a had a passion project a few years ago to create a mental health related app to guide people with finding their purpose.  It a very open and honest session, particulary with the leadership from the Mod 4 students talking about a difficult but important subject.  It was very exciting to dig into what apps were out there and then come up with improvement/alternatives that could be built with software skills acquired from Turing! 
 
 
 ## E: Community Participation
 
 ### Playing a Part
 
 A big part of why I came to Turing was to interact with the community.  As a Mod 1 student I got to know many of my classmates very well in a short time and really enjoyed getting to know some of the students from the upper mods and backend program as well.  Additionally, my interaction with the instructors from my class as well as the other mods was engaging and meaningful.  While not participating in formal community roles, I believe consistently trying to connect with and engage with fellow community members in a positive way and emphasize really listening is what I have mostly contributed thus far and plan to continue doing so.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I honestly feel like we can each make a contribution towards Turing's goal of enabling human potential through creating a diverse develepment community.  I try to quietly and mindfully do my part by trying to provide space for people to feel comfortable to try new things, challenge themselves and also calm down and de-energize in order to keep at the long road of life-long learning.  By getting people from truly all types of backgrounds and experience into creating software, we actually can make a difference.
