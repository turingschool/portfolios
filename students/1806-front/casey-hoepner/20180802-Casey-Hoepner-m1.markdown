# Casey Hoepner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Before coming to Turing I had almost no programming skills. During Mod 1 I set out to learn the foundational skills and knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to start working towards a complete career shift into Software Development. Having gone to the Success at Turing workshop and talked to current students about their experience at Turing, I knew the pace would be rigorous. I aimed to make sure I was practicing good habits that would keep me going (eating regularly, sleeping enough, getting outdoors, exercise, etc.). One of the main reasons I chose to study at Turing as opposed to online was for community. I desired to be around others who were working toward similar goals as me. I wanted to be able to ask questions as they come up and aid others in their learning as well. I made great friends this Mod from Mods1 and 2 and we have been incredible supports to each other during this process.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cah2858/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [Evaluation Comments and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/number-guesser/casey-hoepner.md)

The object of this project was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. This was an individual project, and it served as our gateway to our future paired javascript projects. 

#### Static Comp 1

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

We weren't too deep into the module yet, so I took this static comp as an opportunity to experiment with design. My biggest win was adding photos to the individual boxes on hover. This project also gave me an opportunity to learn CSS grid -- which I hadn't used before. 

Evaluation comments: Nice job adding opacity to the hover photos so that the overlaid text remains easy to read, but perhaps make it a bit more opaque next time. Don't forget your meta tag!

#### Static Comp 2

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comp 2 gave me less trouble than Static Comp 1 thanks to Flexbox. I also spent much more time wireframing, so my code was easier to execute and I didn't end up backtracking and rewriting it as much. For this static comp I focused on recreating the comp exactly instead of taking design liberties. This helped train me to notice small details and figure out how to reproduce them exactly.

Evaluation comments: Icons are not as universally understood as one might think (apart from the hamburger icon). Make sure icons have descriptive text to go along with them. 

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge--3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

Static Comp 3 was frustrating, but fun. I wireframed like crazy before ever getting started and just took the project on piece by piece. I used grid areas as my main organization tool and it worked flawlessly. It was very easy to alter in my media queries as well. I used flexbox in many of the individual sections for organization. I experimented more with hiding elements and unsetting others upon different page breaks. Overall, I was very pleased with the end result.

**Evaluation comments:** Great organization of CSS, nice naming conventions, very well executed, make sure to use ARIA labels where appropriate, use <a> tags instead of divs when the element will link somewhere to avoid having to put cursor:pointer on everything.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandido/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [Evaluation Comments and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/linked-list/brandon-casey.md)

Linked List challenged us to build a small application including two input fields. Upon entering data on the right side, it would be appended to the right side. We also had to include buttons for removing the appended elements and changing their style. Overall, my partner and I executed the project well. We worked well together, and made a strong effort to get a handle on Git/GitHub. 

**Feedback to me:** "Casey was an absolute pleasure to work with.  I hope we get to do a project together in the future.  Her personality and skillset complimented my working style very well.  She also was really great at helping us with quality control and keeping at it. As we're all learning (which is why we came to this school) there are times of frustration when dealing with lots of new things (ie git/gitHub, all the assignments, etc.) and it can easily be overwhelming.  Casey does a good job of balancing that, I hope she can remember to keep positive and not be too hard on herself during these times of frustration.  She should know that if she stays at this, she'll be an exceptional developer and major contributor to any organization she chooses to be a part of."

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [Evaluation Comments and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/idea-box/casey-chris.md)

This project built on the previous one. There were two input fields, a submit button and appended elements. There was more functionality as well. We were asked to incorporate local storage and search/filter functionality. These new challenges pushed us, but Chris and I executed this project very well. We worked almost exclusively together and had fun with it. 

**Feedback to me:** "Casey is very easy to work with. She has a very calm demeanor and is eager to collaborate. She is especially adept with CSS and did a great job handling most of the the styling on the project. When arranging times to meet, she was very accommodating and had no issue scheduling around my unavailability on Saturday. I would recommend that Casey not hesitate to ask questions. There were a few times when she mentioned not following the javascript code. She preferred to revisit the code later to make sure she understood everything, which is great. But another step she could take here is to ask clarifying questions while pairing."

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gmasterofnone/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)
* [Evaluation Comments and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/to-do-box/graham-casey.md)

This project required us to take someone else's code and refactor it so that it met the functionality requirements of the project. The code was a giant mess, but Graham and I wrangled it with relative ease. We refactored the HTML and CSS first and then overhauled the JavaScript. In the end, we completed all required phases and learned a ton in the process. 

**Feedback to me:** "Casey was a pleasure to work with. We were able to quickly establish a positive rapport, making the project a breeze.  Specifically, Casey's attention to detail make simple errors almost non-existent.  I find her to be and outstanding team mate and a very strong programmer. I think a standout quality of Casey's is her consistent drive for perfection. But in some cases, this could lead to a distraction in the details and an overall loss in focus on the project as a whole.  I would recommend some self reflection if she feels stuck on a specific issue to realize how that detail can be solved at a later time when minds are fresh."

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a Mod1 student it's easy to feel like you don't have a lot to give yet. While I look forward to being able to pair with lower Mods, I still feel like I was able to give a fair amount to my peers this mod. I was happy to help anyone who had questions about the things I am strong in and made a point to check in with people about how they were doing and the progress they were making. I spent several evenings over at a classmate's apartment helping her with static comps, and I also made myself available to look over people's code/give suggestions on how to style/organize. I also made a point to attend community and posse events with the Joan Clark Society and QueerQoders. I paired with Mod2 students when I felt stuck and they turned out to be invaluable resources. I plan to give back to Mod1-ers next Mod so that they can feel supported and inspired like I have.
