# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to find a passion in programming. Coming into the program I knew explicitly that I wanted to do this in order to be financially successful and free of those nagging worries. 

I am grateful to say that I have found a passion in solving complex logical and mathematical problems. When I encounter these within a project I have fun. The work is stimulating for my mind and lets me focus on more constructive problems instead of my mind wondering.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

SW-api Box was my first true introduction to the concept of altering state to reflect updated values on the page. My partner Ben and I struggled with the 'favoriting concept' initially but were able to eventually glean the value of simplicity in code and data storage. React-router, at the time, was essentially magic for both of us but nonetheless started us down the path to utilize this critical piece of technology.

### #Comments:

### Rubric

#### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 6 iterations above and implements the extension.

#### Code Quality

- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

#### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### React Router

- 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

#### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### Wireframes

- Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

- 4 - Zero complaints

#### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
