# Tim Garrity - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to find a passion in programming. Coming into the program I knew explicitly that I wanted to do this in order to be financially successful yet struggled to find lasting motivation. 

I am grateful to say that I have found a passion in solving complex logical and mathematical problems. When I encounter these within a project I have fun. The work is stimulating and lets me focus on more constructive problems instead of my mind wondering.

PASSED


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Binary Challenge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salamandastron1/hubble-bubble.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

Doing this project in a week was rough but I am proud of the final product. It also serves as a nice check in to see where my strengths are and areas that I can improve. Most proud of of the logic for generating different questions and how the UI looks (staaaaaaarrrs). Challenges included testing thunks within in thunks as well as working with an api that offers little in the way of organization.

### Binary Challenge Rubric

#### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

[10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

#### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

#### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

#### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### SW-api Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salamandastron1/swapi-box.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SW-api Box was my first true introduction to the concept of altering state to reflect updated values on the page. My partner Ben and I struggled with the 'favoriting concept' initially but were able to eventually glean the value of simplicity in code and data storage. React-router, at the time, was essentially magic for both of us but nonetheless started us down the path to utilize this critical piece of technology.

### #Comments:

### Rubric

#### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 6 iterations above and implements the extension.

#### Code Quality

- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

#### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### React Router

- 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

#### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### Wireframes

- Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

- 4 - Zero complaints

#### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salamandastron1/Movie_Tracker.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie tracker was challenging in the way that there was little time to implement entirely new systems. Redux and redux-thunks were at their core simple but it took a little in order to implement them in the way that was effective. I would say our greatest challenge though was keeping up to date on what the code was doing instead of opting to divide and conquer.

### Rubric 

#### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.
  
  [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### Project Professionalism

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and
  readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase
  workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a
  complete mastery of React architecture.

#### Testing

* 3.5 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

#### Redux Architecture


* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in a the Success @ Turing Session to give incoming students a little perspective. This ended up being a lot of fun and I wanted to give them a solid foundation for expectations in what they needed to succeed.

I also clean my dishes. Take that society.
