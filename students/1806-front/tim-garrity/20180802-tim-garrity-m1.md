# Tim Garrity - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn coding. That is the straight and simple here. I came into Turing with almost no knowledge of coding and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do this. My main goal is to have a job where I make more money and am able to work in a more comfortable environment. As time goes on I hope to discover something that truly peaks my passion.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**`: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Number Guesser! The first real project that I ever sat down to accomplish. Honestly I struggled intensely with this one. DOM manipulation was not inuitive for me and spent the better part of the 4th of July trying to understand how to make a button stop refreshing the page(e.preventDefaut btw). Overall I learned a lot about styling and getting elements onto the dom.

### Student: Tim
### Evaluator: Louisa
### Notes/What To Work On:

- keep working at really locking in your JS foundation, glad to hear that things were solidifying as you worked on this project
- in bigger functions, don't be afraid to pull logic out into it's own function and then call it inside other functions
- code is in a good place for a refactor

-----------------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This project started out with an interesting twist. My partner was out of town in Boston. I quickly learned however that in programming this is not a barrier to getting work done. With proper communication we were able to still accomplish most of the rubric set out before us. Plus if I ever wanted to work remotely this is exactly the process that I would have to follow. Big takeways, using conditionals effectively and having code that accomplished multiple actions.

* Notes/What To Work On:
* More detail commited messages
* break out into more branches
* nice organization of UI
* keep working on responsiveness (experiment with bigger screens)
* adding aria roles/labels
* careful of adding extra layers like divs just for styling purposes
* Good organization of css elements, classes, ids, and media queries
* Next step: organizing properties a little more
* experiment more with pixels and percentages especially for margins and padding
* consistency between anonymous functions and function declarations for anonymous functions
* breaking out functions into smaller functions
* keep looking into true/false statements and how you can refactor those

#### Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

### Student: Sabrin and Tim
### Evaluator: David Whitaker
### Notes/What To Work On:
### Idea Box

Now that there were a few projects under our belts I felt confident getting through this one. I was wrong, but my confidence helped propel me through accomplishing the major tasks. I worked on localStorage and JSON for a large amount of time trying to understand how they worked. There were moments that the code seemingly did not work out of spite. My partner and I were able come out of the other side with the help of some gracious peers and senior students.

#### General
* Check out the style guides!!!!!

#### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

#### CSS
* pull duplicate declaration blocks into their own class ie. `small-button` that applies to all small buttons

#### JS
* Work on naming conventions - no need to say data type but think about using plural words
  * air on the side of being too descriptive
* Only add parameters if you know you'll use them
* Separate the data model from the markup
* Think about having a qualities array

### Git
* Love seeing so many commits!

### Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.

### HTML

### Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

### Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

### CSS

### Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

### JAVASCRIPT

### Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

### Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

### DOM Manipulation

* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


### GIT & GITHUB

### Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

### Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

### DESIGN

### Comp Recreation

* Novice  Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

### PAIRING

### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

### TERMINOLOGY

### Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

### 2Do Box
### Students: Tim & Tanj
### Evaluator: Holt

Tanj was an absolute pleasure to work with and made this project a blast to work through. This was probably the first time that I feel I contributed an equitable amount of value to a project. Before, it felt like I had been riding on the wings of my partner or the people I had asked for help. This time though I was able to puzzle through the logic and find solutions that were of my own creation.

### Notes/What To Work On:
- Great naming conventions🎉
- Loved that both teammates were fully able to explain entire project. Also the love and supportive space you created for each other💗
_ Fully functional💪
- Start using array prototypes instead of for loops!
- Consider organization - where event listeners are, order of functions, etc.
