## A: End of Module Assessment

    3 - Make sure foundations are at 100% before clouding  my brain with technologies that rely on understanding the fundamentals


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I believe I progressed in a linear manner throughout the mod and produced a better project for each iteration.
I feel like a true software developer and not just someone who dabbles with code.
An amatuer on my best day, it feels good to know I can build what I want if I learn how

#### (HeadCount 2.0)


(description)
An intense introduction to the module, headcount was a projected that I aimed high for but fell short of expectations.
A fun project that was my first introduction into the practical use of API's on the web

#### (Kidelodeon)


(description)
My favourite project thus far. I got 2 random cards that determined my app. The application is far from perfect but it was an educational journey. Learning saga and selectors in association with react and redux was a very fun time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kayyali18/SWAPI-Box-AK-CH)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

(description)
A single page app built using react.js, taking advantage of its Router library.  I was able to use SASS and begin learning to structure my CSS following the SMACCS guidelines.


#### movie-tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kayyali18/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

(description)
A fun introduction to Redux, the movie tracker app utilised an SQL database for login functionality and data storage.
Testing was definitely a weak point of mine at this point.



## D: Professional Skills
Gear Up is one of the main things that Turing does differently, and one of the main reasons I decided to come here. Throughout the mod we covered various topics that exposed me to ways in which I can better myself and the community I am part of.

### Gear Up
#### (Job Search Strategies)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown)

As always the sessions from Allison were greatly beneficial in easing the fears of job hunting. Strategies and tip were provided but also actual resources.

#### (The Ethics of AI)

The ethics of Artificial Intelligence in the community is a discussin that is bound to happen in the next 30 years whether we like it or not. I chose this lesson to get a head start. AI definitely has good aspects to it but at the same time we have no idea how much limits/controls we have over the.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Other than a couple pairings, I spent my time this mod trying to hone my social skills. Last mod, my inability to properly socialise with others caused some unwarranted negative emotions. I hope that this mod I was able to present myself in a more acceptable manner, resulting in less conflicts with my colleagues.
I was troubled with personal issues this mod and was unable to play much of a part in my own life except for code, let alone in others. Unfortunately this mod, I was not an example of an active member of the community. I hope in the final that I am able to do a lot more than I did this time around
