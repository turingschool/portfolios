# Ahmad Kayyali - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Developing the ability to manage larger projects that require various libraries and frameworks. To learn how to implement, design, and test applications while managing data and state with react.js. API interaction and resolving calls with the use of promises such as fetching the weather.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The introduction of frameworks such as react have helped me complete projects like weatherly. 
I am now capable of building an application that can interact with the user and an API in order to achieve a meaningful result.


#### (Complete Me)


(description)
A solid introduction to Binary trees and data nodes, complete was a well rounded project that built on the previous knowledge of classes and node traversal. 
It is my favourite project because I was one of a few people in the class to actually come up with the algorithms for searching, retrieving, and suggesting.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Game Time - Tron Classic

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gmasterofnone/tron-classic)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

(description)
Build a game of either Frogger, Tron , or Snake. Tron was an interesting challenge where class inheritance and canvas were a major learning curve. 
A fun project, I learned a lot about how to work with code that is seperated into many modules

#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kayyali18/weatherly-AK-JS)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

(description)
The weatherly app was finally the first project that we built that had a real world application. It finally allowed me to realise that after weatherly I can nearly build anything I want.
React is a great framework that makes life easy, and the weatherly project forced us to learn how asychronous code works with things such as state and props

##### Pam Lovett's Evaluation
You rock


## D: Professional Skills
Gear Up is one of the main things that Turing does differently, and one of the main reasons I decided to come here. Throughout the mod we covered various topics that exposed me to ways in which I can better myself and the community I am part of.

### Gear Up
#### (Empathy and Privilege)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown)

This session introduced us to the privileges that we may have over others, and it taught us that with that privilege comes empathy. It is important to realise what your are blessed with so you can do your best with it. Although many of my colleagues felt more privileged than I was, I still see myself as a priviliged elite. Most of the world's population would dream of living a life as easy as mine, even though I see my life as tough in it's own way

#### (Attention Economy)

This session actually hada major impact on the way I live my daily and how I spend my time. The session, was informative. Since attending the seesion, I started to spend time on my own without the help of 
my phone, laptop, or even headphones to distract me. As people of the 21st century we have become so accustomed to being stimulated that spending time on your own for just 5 minutes without any distractions has become a difficult task for most of us


#### (Disruption)

We all like routine, we like to follow set procedures that we have followed our lives expecting a calculated outcome. The Disruption session explained how sometimes disruptions in one's life are for the better. As a devloper, a lot of things will disrupt my flow especially in the future when I am working at a company. It is important to flow with the disruption rather than against it

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Other than a couple pairings, I spent my time this mod trying to hone my social skills. Last mod, my inability to properly socialise with others caused some unwarranted negative emotions. I hope that this mod I was able to present myself in a more acceptable manner, resulting in less conflicts with my colleagues.
