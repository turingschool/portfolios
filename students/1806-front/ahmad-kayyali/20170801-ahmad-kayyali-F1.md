# Ahmad Kayyali - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To consistently apply myself in various projects that will test and expand my knowledge in all the front-end languages, frameworks, and libraries. I came in hoping to develop a designers eye and my computational thinking skills. I do suffer from being overwhelmed by CSS and how to set up a beautiful yet efficient webpage; and although my skill in that area has improved, I still have a long way to go.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pending


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Throughout the past month and a half, I was able to see my progress as it happened. Static Comps were my favourite because I am really keen on learning design in a proper manner. On the other hand, I had much fun with 2 Do Box because I was able to complete all the phases and I like it when my brain is tickled.

#### Number Guesser Game

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of the module we built many applications while pairing with a  classmate.  The pairing allowed me to look at code at ways which I would never have thought of. The most challenging project was the 2 Do Box, but it was the most satisfying. 

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcusp619/linked-list-MP-AK)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

(description)
The linked list app allows a user to enter a website title and link that is then bookmarked allowing the user to keep track of whether that page has been read or not. A fairly straightforward project, it was a good workout that helped establish my foundations.

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/idea-box-TN-AK)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

(description)
The idea box app introduced us to local storage and data manipulation with JSON. A user can enter an idea that has a title and body. The idea is then stored in local storage using JSON. The idea generated was able to retain quality if it was voted up or down.

#### (2 Do Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kayyali18/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(description)
The 2 Do Box was a pivot off the idea box. We were asked to clone an existing repository that had buggy code and were tasked with refactoring the application. Upon completion, we had to convert the pre-existing idea box to become a fully function to-do list that can filter for results, keep track of a task's importance, and task are editable.

## D: Professional Skills
Gear Up is one of the main things that Turing does differently, and one of the main reasons I decided to come here. Throughout the mod we covered various topics that exposed me to ways in which I can better myself and the community I am part of.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I overstress myself; I used to a lot more though. Working in a stressful environment - a basement - and doing a lot of coding can drive one nuts. From this session onwards, I realised that I was not the only one. People here at Turing are just like me and we all go through hard times. I know I have a communtiy of people around me that are completely supportive of me; and it makes me feel good.
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This session was fun. The tech industry is actively working towards a more equal, fair, and accepting workplace - and I am soon to be part of it. The video shown gave me interesting insights into the dilemmas that women face at work, and I hope to be someone who can be part of the change and prevent injustice.
#### (Developer Identity)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/developer_identity.md)

As a developer on the web, you're identity lives in the same place that your work is done. Employers and possible job prospects all live online, and it is up to me to sell myself as a competent, hard-working, and driven developer. I updated my Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github after the session and I aim to expand those profiles as my knowledge does.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this module I went through many changes. I went from being a disruptive member of the community to actively engaged. I did a lighting talk hoping to gather support for a hackathon and managed to get the hackathon-posse off the ground. I hope to continue off this personal success and further bolster my support to the community as a whole.
