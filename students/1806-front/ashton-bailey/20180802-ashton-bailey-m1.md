# Ashton Bailey - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this mod were focused towards establishing a lifestyle that would fit in well with the curriculum. I didn't know enough about code to set a focus within the curriculum itself. I set out to try a few different methods to organize my time at home and at school. I tried to integrate pomodoros, time boxing, and a set eating/sleeping schedule to keep myself balanced.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass, with some notes for improvement moving into the next mod.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

As I progressed through each of these, I learned a little more about time management and balancing the demands of them and of the paired projects. 

#### Number Guesser

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashtonkbailey/akb-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Recreate a static comp, taking no liberties with layout. Creative license allowed for other aspects.

Check minor spacing details. Finish media queries.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashtonkbailey/akb-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

same as above

Work on color contrasts. Tighten up line spacing. Adjust font sizes in media queries.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashtonkbailey/akb-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Each project built on the JS requirements of the last. The biggest non-technical takeaway was being able to communicate with my partner about the time I needed to dedicate to my own projects.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

The user would enter content into a form and it would display in a list to the right of the page. Each form submission would add to the top of the list.

Notes/What To Work On:
some buggy UI behavior and a few little fine tuning layout details left over , but overall good job
code is in a good place for a refactor

I appreciate Ashton's ability to collaborate and work together to obtain a goal. Ashton always showed up on time and worked diligently, allowing us to create a solid product. She is very proficient in CSS and showed me several things i didn't previously  understand. Ashton could work a little more on her JavaScript by approaching problems in bite sizes rather than looking at the big picture. She could work on taking problems step by step. Ashton was able to logically work through issues but this could help save time in the future! It was a pleasure working with her.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/Idea_Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

We built an app that would save user input form content into localStorage and bring it back out to display on the page. We used JS to manipulate the data in storage.

Notes/What To Work On:
Making sure both sides are making commits
Keep working on making more commits and creating new feature branches
Add hover states to buttons
Make sure save button is disabled when inputs are empty
Great structure of css and easy to ready through
Keep experimenting with drying up code and using more grouping
Experiment using pixels/percentages instead of using decimals for ems/rems
Nice job breaking out global variables, event listeners, and functions
Be consistent about breaking out functions from event listeners
Good job using constructor function
Continue to dry up repeated lines of code including breaking out the appending card functions into one function
Experiment using array prototype methods over for loops
Start using jQuery in your next project

I appreciate that you seemed to grasp many of the difficult concepts we were studying, even though together we didn't know how exactly to proceed at every step of the project.  I thought you had an excellent ability to recollect concepts that we discussed in class, such as DOM traversal, that took me a much longer time to absorb. I very much appreciated that you had such a strong ability to listen in class and remember these difficult topics, because we were able to use them in our project. The most specific example that comes to mind is when you "cracked the code" regarding the For Loop for repopulating the idea cards in our idea box. I was very impressed by how you remembered that we needed to add the "(i)" to our loop in one spot to get it working. Although we agreed in our DTR to communicate openly with each other about things that weren't working for us during our work time together, I felt that you did not always communicate with me in a constructive way during times in which you seemed to disagree with me. There were a few instances during the more stressful or frustrating parts of our assignment work together where I felt some hostility coming from you towards me in response to mistakes I had made in my project reasoning or in suggestions I had made that you disagreed with. On the Wednesday before the project was due, for example, I recall that when I tried to suggest a next step in our program, you responded, "I don't know what you're saying" in a tone that suggested annoyance.  In a separate instance, which may have been during the same work session or the day before, when I suggested a next step to take, you responded, "why would we do that?" in a similarly annoyed tone.  This hurt my feelings because I was feeling overwhelmed by material that I didn't fully understand yet, and I felt, based on your tone and words, like you were judging me for not know the correct answer in this case. I do not intend to assume that I know what you may have been thinking or feeling during these instances. However, I would recommend that you observe your responses to people in the future when you don't understand what they are saying or if you disagree with a suggestion they're making, as well as your tone when you respond to them.  Though not everyone you work with may be as sensitive to tone as I am, being aware of your tone during stressful future work instances would likely benefit your overall working environments and work relationships.

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashtonkbailey/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Refactor the last project to meet original specs. Add more functionality to the list from the user perspective. Big takeaway is the refactoring process.

Git/Github
Good number of commits - would like more detail in each

HTML
Good use of aria labels

CSS
Avoid comma seperated selectors

JS
Decouple the data model from the markup (our ToDos could be displayed as table rows instead of cards)
Pull duplicate blocks into their own functions and pass arguments where necessary

I really enjoyed how we worked together.  It felt collaborative, there was a good balance between who was typing and who was talking.  I appreciated how we solved problems together and could talk through the problem-- it was okay to get things right or wrong.  I also appreciate how each of us kept the other accountable to time and honored the time we set aside to work with each other. At times, the look on your face indicates you are thinking through a problem; it is so helpful to your partner when you share what you are thinking.  But honestly, this was really a great experience and I had to think hard to come up with something.  Thank you!

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

It took a couple of weeks for me to open up and insert myself into public discussion. I represented our cohort in the bake-off. I will be sitting in the Turing booth at the Ethiopian Cultural Festival this weekend. I went to almost all of the wrap ups. I went to one Health and Wellness Posse meeting. I participated in the Significant Other Meetup during the mod. I voted in the Code Fair. I plan to attend the Demo Night and graduation for Mod4 folks. I hope to do more next mod.
