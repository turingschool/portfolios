# (John Binning) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for the module was to get as comfortable as possible with the fundamentals of front-end development.  More specifically, I wanted to have a working knowledge of some basic CSS properties and how I can use them, to be comfortable manipulating the DOM with Javascript, and to be able to create clean semantic markdown without difficulty.  Beyond just learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I wanted to get oriented with the developer community.  That involves investing in relationships with students and teachers at Turing, and learning how to properly use Github.  Being a functional member of the community is important in any field, but I am becoming more and more aware that it is especially important with web development.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our first project during Mod1 was Number Guesser, a game where users guess a randomly generated number.  Other individual projects included three static comp CSS challenges.

### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The Number Guesser project requires students to create a site that randomly generates a number, starting between 1-100.  Users will input a guess, then the application provides feedback as to whether their guess was correct, too high, or too low.  Upon a correct guess, the range would increase by ten on either side.  The user can set a custom range of numbers if they prefer.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

### Static Comp 3 Scores:

Threes in all categories


While the static comps have not been easy, they have been my favorite projects of Mod1.  I really enjoy the challenge of trying to get every detail correct.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were given three group projects, Linked List, ideabox, and ToDoBox.

#### (Linked List)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a page where users can add and delete links to their favorite sites.  They can mark links as read, and if clicked links will open the stored url in a new tab.

#### Evaluator: Louisa

#### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

#### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VazGghcFbXZkeFrnJd_Jo_rGhgpqzbV0ObwjBOQeJr8/edit)

Idea Box was very similar to linked list, but allowed the ideas to persist based on utilizing local storage.

#### Evaluator: Louisa

#### Specification Adherence

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

It's interesting to look back on the first gear up of the mod now that we are at the end.  I can say that I have had some pretty strong moments of having having both a fixed and a growth mindset.  It has been valuable to be able to recognize what is happening during times of having a fixed mindset, and taking steps to switch back to growth.  I think this session has been and will continue to be valuable to me as I work my way through the highs and lows of Turing.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I learned that I need to focus on recognizing when I'm stuck.  When I do get stuck, I need to find a way to get myself out of a rut.  I also recognized that worrying about the whole process of learning to code is just going to be frustrating.  It's best to take things one project/day at a time, and I can accomplish this by breaking down/splitting up difficult/daunting tasks.  I also need to go easier on myself on my mistakes.



#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I found the quote about women in history interesting "Women are an equal part of the past but not an equal part of history".
When they spoke about not having computer sciense as a subject in high school, I could really relate, I wish I could have been exposed to the subject much earlier.

Two biggest takeaways: 
-it's almost if not completely impossible for me to understand the experiences of people who are a different gender, race... than I am if no one speaks up
-it's much easier to develop applications that are usable for everyone when we have a diverse team of developers.

### PROtocol

*   [PROtocol slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit#slide=id.g1c505a3b55_0_258)

I learned that I need to be sensitive to how I give an receive feedback.  It is important to stop and think about how I am perceiving/giving feedback based on how I'm feeling.

### Professional Development Workshops

*   [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/identity_essentials)
*   [Github](https://github.com/JohnBinning)
*   [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-binning-289607132/)
*   [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7484758/john-binning)

I recognize the value of looking professional on social media.  Social media is a great way to network, and could lead to job leads.  It influences other people's impressions of you.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### For Justyna Field, linked-list partner:

Working with Justyna was great.  We had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind.  I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started.  I would be happy to work with her again.

#### For Mike Fenwick, Mod 2 pairing partner.

Pairing with Mike was great.  He has been very invested in helping me reach and understand solutions to problems I was having.  Mike didn’t just give me answers, he made me think about what I was trying to do.  He has also been supportive of my growth mindset.  When I was feeling down, he related back to his mod1 experiences and encouraged me to keep pressing on and not worry.  I look forward to pairing/working with Mike again in the future.

#### For Devon Bull, ToDo Box partner:

Working with Devon was great.  He has a fantastic work ethic and is very encouraging.  We worked together on the ToDo Box  Pivot and I felt that the pairing went well.  I was able to side by side pair with him effectively, and I believe we did a good job of splitting to work individually.  When we split, we always made sure to come back and explain what we had done, not moving on until both partners understood what was going on with the new work.  For the sake of providing constructive feedback, Devon could possibly work on prioritizing tasks.  He generally did a good job working with me, but I worry about how sustainable spending the night at school to finish his comp3 is.  I would be very happy to pair with Devon in the future, and plan on doing so.

#### For Marissa Reinke, Mod 2 pairing partner:

positive feedback:
Marissa was great about giving me enough information to not let me be stuck, but she did not spoon feed me either
negative feedback:
None - honest


### Being a Community Member

#### From Justyna Field, linked-list partner: 

 I really enjoyed working with John. We determined our working relationship right away with great respect of each other’s working habits and schedule differences. During our work process we exchanged clarifying questions. If there was any part of the project that one of us did not fully understand we would stop and take time to walk each other through the problem and make sure that we both fully understand that topic. I feel like we both equally contributed into the project, it was a very good pairing experience.
 
#### From Mike Fenwick, Mod 2 pairing partner:

Pairing with John has been a great experience. From the very start I could tell he was fully engaged and focused on the task in hand. 
If we worked through something to solve an issue John wanted to know exactly what was going on and why. He wasn't happy just taking the code functionality at face value which is a great mind set to have. 
If John continues with this approach throughout Turing and into the work field then I can see John having a successful career in development.
I would happily pair/work with John again.

#### From Devon Bull, ToDo Box partner:

Since we partnered the second week it's always been great to work with you. You have a great work ethic and a focus that is both awesome and terrifying. Communication is never a problem. For constructive feedback: you need to focus on Javascript more. You are very quick to read code and there are certain aspects that you have a great understanding of (event bubbling). It would definitely help you to fly solo in JS more.

#### From Zane Russell, Idea Box partner:

Pairing with you was a great experience. Great work ethic, easy to communicate with, and I really admire how determined you were to thoroughly understand every part of the operation on before moving forward. I have a tendency to fly by the seat of my pants and ask questions later, so having some temperance was a sobering and helpful dynamic. 5/5 would pair again


### Playing a Part

I feel that although I played a part in the community this mod, I have room to grow in the future.  I tried to set up lunch roulettes, and sometimes was successful.  I joined the Imposters community and went to every lunch I could, even when I was not feeling like an imposter.  I also regularly reached out and attempted to encourage members of my mod who were not feeling confident, and led a study group for the final quiz.
