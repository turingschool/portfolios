Going in to Module 2, my goal was to build upon my understanding of javascript, css, and html while learning more advanced javascript principles and React.

#### Goals
* Be more confident in my knowledge
* Be more involved in the Community
* Continue pairing with earlier mods
* Think more deeply about where I want to be after Turing

## Rubric Scores

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/weatherly)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project we are tasked with creating a weather app that utilized React and API's. Not only did the application need to have clean HTML and CSS, it needed to be responsive and persist in local storage as well. The app had current, 7 hour, and 10 day weather forecasts.

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.


## Testing

<!-- 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
 -->
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## B: Individual Work & Projects

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Suite
# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/sorting-suite)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

In this project we utilized three sorting methods: bubble, insertion, and merge sort.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

We were asked to write an algorithm that would autocomplete words from a dictionary.

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This was he first pair project of the mod. The game that my partner and I chose was connect four. Using HTML Canvas we drew the board and piece and used

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style


* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### From me to Adam Carpenter:
Adam was a great partner during Game Time. He had some trouble in the beginning of the project getting organized and communicating thoughts about the project which as a result caused him to get discouraged and check out a little bit. Once we got a grasp on what needed to be done though he was great and quickly gained momentum. At times though when he did have an idea he would quickly implement the code without talking through his process leaving me somewhat behind in the dust. There was also a tendency to give up on functionality in earlier phases of the project and just do unnecessary styling. I had to spend some time during the project reigning Adam in when he was straying to far from the project outline. Outside of those few instances though Adam was a very flexible partner and once I voiced that I wasn't understanding something he was doing her was more than willing to explain thing to me until I understood it.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Lindsay:
What I most appreciated about pairing with Travis was his ability to come 'down to our level' and articulate concepts in a way that wasn't too much of a stretch for us to understand. I honestly spent time thinking about some critical feedback and couldn't come up with anything. Sorry! In general though, I also appreciate that Travis is just a genuine guy, this made our pairing very comfortable; I felt like he had an interest in our understanding and I didn't feel like I had anything to prove.

#### From Hector:
Travis does a great job of explaining how everything works. He's super patient. He doesn't just give the answers, he does a great job of guiding me towards finding a solution. I recommended pairing with him to others and will do so again in the future.

#### From Ralph Burnette:
Great explanation of git hub, Travis was great at making sense of a confusing issue Hector and I had about our paired project and making Git work for us.

### Playing a Part

During this mod I had more of an opportunity than last to be more involved in the Turing community. I decided that I wanted to bring back the Turing Podcast and did so with another student from mod 2 backend which has turned out to be a fun and interesting experience. My plan is to continue with the podcast through the rest of my time at Turing. On top of the podcast I've also been attending IronFE in the mornings and had done TONS of pairing with the earlier mods as well which has been helpful for me during this mod.
