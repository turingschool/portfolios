## A: End of Module Assessment

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Self Directed Project
## Instructor: Jhun
## Comments:

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/Fatal-Force)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

In this project we are tasked with creating an app that utilized React, Redux, possibly a backend, and API's. Not only did the application need to have clean JSX, it needed to have testing.

### Completion

3: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### Organization

3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Technical Quality

### Test-Driven Development

3: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

### Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.
Product Experience

### User Experience

3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

### Performance

3: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## B: Group Work & Projects

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Headcount 2.0

## Students: Travis and Ciara

## Evaluator: Taylor

## Notes:

### Specification Adherence

2.5 - The application completes 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

2.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

### Testing

Not expected to update this project, teammates should focus on next testing in SwapiBox.

3 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## SWAPIbox

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/swapi-box)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## Students: Travis, Lindsay

## Instructor: Taylor

## Notes:

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3.5 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## MovieTracker

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/movie-tracker)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

## Students: Travis, James, Ciara

## Instructor: Jhun

### Specification Adherence

2.5: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

## C: Professional Skills

During this mod we were asked to take a good amount of time to think about where we want to be after Turing with regards to our careers. We were tasked with coming up with plans and prospects to help get us on track to getting that dream job. During this time I went in and fixed up my LinkedIn and built up a resume that better suit my future as a developer. I also reached out to some developers locally in an effort to build some relationships that may down the road help in getting me in to a job that I enjoy.

## D: Gear Up

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Parable of The Polygons

- Depending on the types of people in the management position, jobs could quickly become filled with one type of person rather than a diverse group.
- My thoughts towards quotas is mixed still. While I agree with the notion that the workplace should be diverse, I also believe that the most qualified person should get the job. Bringing someone in to a position just based on their race, gender, or age leaves a lot of room for a lower quality employee to be hired. Quotas force something that should be natural.
- I think just addressing the issue in the workplace and talking openly about it really makes a difference. Most people aren't consciously biased so if it is brought up they will become aware of it and change.
- Turing just needs to keep practicing what they preach. If the school continues to be an open and diverse place then the people coming and going will take that mindset with them. Just keep talking about the issue and making people aware of their own biases.
- Its goal was to show how individual biases can become a larger societal issue and how they can influence diversity positively or negatively.

### MicroAggresions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

In this session we spoke in depth about microagressions. In my group we spoke about how this term has been effective in identifying what we called unattended racism, sexism, and bigotry that has been bread in to us since childhood. Coming from an immigrant family I experience MA's all the time but the people in my group coming from privileged upbringings had a difficult time relating. What we did find though was that the term is beginning to be abused and used in such a way that people are taking to many things and turning them in to micro-agressions.

### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

Writing Section:

Scenario 1:

In this situation I could be an ally by addressing the individual speaking and asking why this is distracting them, and if they are just easily distracted or take issue with gay pride. Ignoring this situation could leave the people on the receiving end feeling alienated or un-validated.

Scenario 2:

To be an ally to the people that don't drink I would first recommend to the group that there are other options other than drinking as a social event. I would talk with them about why and that it might put our cohort mates in a position that they aren't comfortable with. Not addressing this issue could potentially drive a wedge in the cohort by alienating those people and leave them feeling like their not being heard and aren't really part of the group.

Scenario 3:

I would address the person that thinks this setup is unfair and ask them why they think it is unfair and then follow up with why they think these groups meet and are as "exclusive" as they are. This person may come from a place of privilege that sets them up to feel left out when they aren't involved in exclusive groups around them. Left unsaid this person would be validated and the groups

Final Question:

Being an ally at Turing requires you to listen and consider where the non allied are coming from, getting to the root of their issue, and talk to them to help them see things in a different light or at least empathize more with the group they are alienating. You should also be aware of your of privilege and use that awareness to help you be an ally.

To continue being an ally elsewhere it will take a lot of persistence and work addressing issues as they arise and not just sitting back in silence as they happen.

### Learning a New Language

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language/)

In this gear up we discussed what worked and what didn't work when we tried to learn a new language. We talked about some good ways all devs can learn a language and looked up some useful tools for doing so. We then chose a language and looked in to useful resources for learning that language before speaking to the group about what they found helpful and what they learned in the short amount of time.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### From me to Lindsay:
Lindsay and I had a couple of feedback sessions throughout our project most of which was good. We worked very well together and due to Lindsays planning and drive we had a successful project.

#### From me to Ciara:
Ciara and I gave/received very little feedback from one another during or after the project. She was however great to work with and made this project enjoyable.

### Getting Feedback

#### From Lindsay:
Travis and I provided verbal feedback throughout the project.  We worked together very well, so all of our feedback for each other was positive.

### Playing a Part
During this mod I really focused on learning the material that I struggled with last mod so I wasn't as involved in the community this go around as last time. I was however very involved within my mod and with IronFE and I've already assumed some responsibility for running IronFE next mod.

------------------

## Final Review
* PASS
### Notes

* IronFE: Run 1, go to many.
* Work on debugging and testing

### Outcome

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
