# Jennifer Peavler - M4 Portfolio 

## Areas of Emphasis:

I wanted to become more familiar with server side code and testing.  I wanted to complete a personal portfolio site that had at least 9 links to hosted projects.
I wanted to spend time applying to 2 jobs per week and making contacts at the companies to which I applied.

I accomplished these goals by doing them.

## Community

I contributed to the community in the following ways:
To my cohort:  Actively asking questions in class.  Participating on Slack with questions/issues.  Lent a set of eyes whenerver anyone asked about their code.
Helped people get things hosted on heroku.
To the community at large:  Attended React meetup.  Wrote a blog.  Bragged about how awesome Turing was to anyone who would listen.  Created a repo for Turing students
to place language learning resources such as reading material and tutorials in an effort to help with learning a second language.

## Gear up

The repo for our group can be found [here](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language/blob/master/administrative/m4-gear-up-outline.md)

Leading the gear up was a great experience.  Our group led the session about when and how to learn a new language.  The group created
a new Turing Slack channel and invited all the participating students.  We also made a repo for anyone to drop in resources on
various programming languages.

The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language)

Hopefully students will continue to contribute to it because it is very well organize and would provide for a great resource.
