# Jennifer Peavler - M2 Portfolio 

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to write more refined Javascript code and utilize the built in code library. I wanted to understand the principles and practices of TDD. I wanted to gain an understanding of React and get more comfortable working with APIs.

## Rubric Scores

A: End-of-Module Assessment: 3 B: Individual Work & Projects: 3 C: Group Work & Projects: 3 D: Professional Skills: 3 E: Feedback & Community Participation: 2.5

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Complete-me

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### Code Sanitation The output from ESLint shows… 4 - Zero complaints

### Sorting Sweet

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Test-Driven Development 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Code Sanitation The output from ESLint shows… 4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Game Time:

Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time Instructor: yung-jhun Comments: Game is functional.

Would like to see more integration tests ( tests that communicate what is actually going on. Not just pulse checks but you replicating situations in the game and asserting you are getting the output you want.)

loved the one test that was automated. Game knows too much

Should probably move collision detection to the ball (for its collisions), and move to board (detecting sides and so forth) If that doesn't make sense you could theoretically move all the collisions to another class to handle the specific collisions like to happen. ( I think the prior suggestion is better...) Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

Mentor outreach occurred with success. Began working on portfolio site. Github/Linked In portfolio set up.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Gave feedback to Jack and Anders. They were my partners for my group projects.

### Being a Community Member

Received feedback from community members.

Working with you on Game Time went really well. You came into the project with a lot of energy and it was nice to be able to hit the ground running. We had to pivot the project a few times, and you were super adaptable, which made the abrupt change not that challenging. You’re also a very competent coder. Overall, solid experience!

Jenn was awesome to work with; she did a good job candidly communicating needs and wants during the project so that we avoided conflicts while working together. Because of this strong communication we successfully worked together in a driver/navigator setup for the first half of the project and then split up to work on separate parts individually. We ended up with a great product that we’re both very proud of. During a few moments in the project Jenn got stoked about the code we were working on while I was driving and I could tell she wanted to jump in and type. She handled this well by eventually jumping on to her computer and getting her thoughts down there to avoid steamrolling me. I loved working with Jenn in part because of how much she enjoyed the project and her enthusiasm in general. This could bite her if she doesn’t set hard deadlines for “pencils down” in the future to avoid having timelines and deadlines dragging on.

### Playing a Part

I made myself available for whiteboarding and was always willing to work on projects and assignments. I engaged in group activities and discussions about the best practices of coding and tried to develop and help develop my peers into better coders. I gave thoughtful feedback to my peers and to all of the excersices that Allison gave us.
