# Chris Jordan - M2 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis

I set out to to further my understanding of JavaScript and learn some of the new concepts of ECMA6. I really wanted to be a bigger part of the community as well and be better at articulating my thoughts and codes with proper technical jargon.

## A: End of Module Assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

---Sorting Suite and Complete-Me were our individual projects. These were more focused on developing our sorting methods and getting familiar with working with nodes.

#### Sorting Suite:

Cool project! Great learning lesson on how and why certain sorting
approaches are more efficient than others


Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Sweet

Evaluation Rubric

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

3 - Five or fewer complaints



### CompleteMe

## C: Group Work & Projects

For group work, we were given Gametime and Weathrly. These
were intended to introduce and expand our knowledge of React, webpack, Enzyme, Canvas, and our JS/ECMA6 abilities.


####   Gametime

Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time

Instructor: Nathaniel

Comments:

Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints


###Weathrly

https://github.com/DBULL7/weathrly

Instructor Evaluation Points: Weathrly

Instructor: Nathaniel

Comments:

Specification Adherence

4 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

2- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

2 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3- The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

Truly appreciated the assistance in developing my Professional Skills with the Gear Ups, the guest speakers, and some of the spikes




#### Feedback session

Date of feedback conversation:

03/25/17

How did you prepare for the conversation?

--Really just going over the DTR and and recollecting how the pairing experience went. First thing I explained was telling my partner to be brutally honest with their feedback and how they wanted my feedback for them should be constructed.

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

-- Very well! Learned a lot of things that were in my blindspot that I can work on and also good practice on how to give constructive feedback.

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

Empathy mainly.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### Getting Feedback

##Devon Bull
Chris was a fantastic partner. Between a strong work ethic and unbelievable tenacity he will go far. He has a 
unique ability to get things working no matter the situation. And he has a very strong grasp on array prototype methods and is always willing to help explain his decisions. I'm proud of our time together.

##Chris Bandrowsky

Chris was a super awesome person to work with on Gametime. We both worked great together, whereas it be in a pairing environment, or, on our own individually. Chris is a super smart guy who had a knack for coming up with ingenious solutions to our problems. It was easy to follow his logic and his coding ideas. Chris can make complex ideas seem simple, and does an excellent job of making others understand those ideas with ease. 10/10, would work with again.

###Giving Feedback

##Devon Bull
Devon was a incredible partner to have. Willing to burn the midnight candle to see work through one step at a time. A source of great ideas to overcome issues at hand, but also capable of running with ideas other than his own comfortably. I can easily say  Devon is developing as a web developer with ease.

##Chris Bandrowsky

Chris was a great partner to work with. Highly capable and could trust him to follow through on work needed. Very patient in explaining his thinking process and very imaginative. Great with design and the know how to structure it. Can grasp complex concepts with ease. He has a future in this web developing thing.

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I made myself completely available to those who wished to pair up with me and ended up working with a few of the FE mod1 students over JS. I attended all the spikes and the guest speakers. I pushed myself to be more social with people in my mod and glad I did, everyone is truly wonderful to collaborate or just shoot the breeze with.
------------------

From Shayla of FE 1703 --Chris has been an excellent resource and support for me this Mod. I am a novice when it comes to JS, however Chris has taken the time to pair with me two to three times a week. Through this experience I've been able to move through mythical creatures with a greater understanding of logic and syntax. Chris has explained the foundations of JS to me in a less complicated way, he's been incredibly patient and always enthusiastic to lend a hand. I've thoroughly appreciated his help. Thanks Mr.Chris.

From Christie Lynam of FE 1703 -- Thank you for pairing with me on multiple occasions. You were super helpful in helping me work thru all the mythical creatures. You were great at explaining things in a way that I could understand. Thank you!

From Ralph Burnette of FE 1703 --Over the course of mod 1 I paired with Chris Jordan several times.  We spent most of our time on mythical creatures and understanding the logic behind solving them.  Chris was absolutely awesome and extremely helpful in the way that he could simplify the problem to help me arrive at the answer.  I would definitely ask for his help in the future and also recommend him to others.

Thank you for your help Chris!
