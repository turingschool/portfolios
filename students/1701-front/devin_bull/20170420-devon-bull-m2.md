-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I felt really good this module. There was a lot less context switching and I was able to focus on learning only one language. The algorithm/data structures projects pushed me and I loved it. I love React and I can't wait to learn more about it as well as get better at testing it. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

# SortingSuite

* [Sorting Suite](https://github.com/DBULL7/Sorting-Suite) 

* [Project Expectations](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Learned a lot, was really excited to be learning things you usually need a CS degree to understand.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Sweet
# Instructor: Nate

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

# CompleteMe
* [Complete Me](https://github.com/DBULL7/complete-me)

* [Project Expectations](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Really cool to learn how autocomplete works behind the scenes. 

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me

- appreciate your gusto and commitment to code
- fix the things and come back to me.


### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

# C: Group Work & Projects


# GameTime

*   [Breakout](https://github.com/DBULL7/breakout)
*   [Gametime Project Expectations](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
## Instructor: yung-jhun
## Comments:

- tests were awesome!

  - keep leaning on those yung-tests

- you have some really great opportunities to refactor some of your classes

  - moving collision to the paddle
  - refactoring levels
  - making a game class to handle all the dom interactions

## Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Instructor Evaluation Points: weathrly
## Instructor: Nate


### Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS/Sass Style
// move css files into folder

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

### JavaScript / React Style
<!-- // break out onclick function DRY -->
<!-- // be consistent with naming of vars in tests -->
// move current-temp-content into c
// stateless components should be functions
// move key off of github

2.5 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing. The application has large components and logic could be broken out to smaller stateless components.


### Testing
// break into multiple files
// no state changes for Header after simulating changes
// pass in props to location and make sure they render
// make sure 10 days are rendered --> mount(Main)

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

2 - Six to ten complaints

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Chris Jordan

Chris was a fantastic partner. Between a strong work ethic and unbelievable tenacity he will go far. He has a unique ability to get things working no matter the situation. And he has a very strong grasp on array prototype methods and is always willing to help explain his decisions. I'm proud of our time together.

### Feedback from the Community

##### Sam Landfried BE M2

In short, Devon’s the man. He is my go-to front end guru, a work-ethic inspiration and just a friendly guy. He convinced me to rewrite my personal site sans-CSS framework and keeps me looking towards the future in regards to what technologies I’m currently learning. I’ve personally benefitted from his influence, and I know the Turing community at large has, as well.


##### Chris Jordan FE M2

Devon was a incredible partner to have. Willing to burn the midnight candle to see work through one step at a time. A source of great ideas to overcome issues at hand, but also capable of running with ideas other than his own comfortably. I can easily say  Devon is developing as a web developer with ease.

##### Lindsay Parker FE M1

Bottom line, you were incredibly helpful to me when we paired over lunch.  Your encouragement to get comfortable with Git and GitHub made a huge difference once I got into pairing projects.  If I had any suggestions for improvement, I'd share them, but I don't, so thank you for the help!

##### Evan Miller FE M1

There were late nights and the struggle was real. Devon, was extremely helpful popping in to check and see if I needed help. There was a moment where I struggling to execute flex box on static comp 2. Devon spent time, drawing out on the white board, a way to build the boxes. This is just one example of how he helped me understand an idea. In all, I have had some great late night conversations with Devon based on his experience above me. I look forward to more of these offerings in the future.

##### Sergey Lukyanenko BE M2

Devon has been a great asset to the Turing Community. As a back end student I approached Devon many times asking him  to help me with front end styling for current projects. With his knowledge and experience in programming he patiently and with courage always willing to help. It’s been a pleasure  to work with Devon. I wish him success in his professional career and continue sharing knowledge and experience with Turing family.

### Playing a Part

I paired with and dropped in to the FE M1 classroom often to see how they were doing/explain Flexbox. 
And I became the FE guy for BE M2 to consult when they run into JS/CSS issues and needed to hear again why they shouldn't use CSS frameworks.
