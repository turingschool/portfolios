# Anders Wood - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

In this module one of my primary focuses was getting comfortable manipulating arrays and objects using the forEach, map, find, filter, and reduce prototype functions.

Goals For Mod-3 And Beyond
* Take more advantage of Turing resources such as mentoring and pairing
* Provide pairing to earlier Mods going forward
* Explore jobs/industries that I want to pursue and network with meetups and other events
* Continue to improve maintaining balance between Turing and life (e.g. exercise, sleep, family time etc.) even in the middle of challenging projects and periods.

## Rubric Scores
Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3.0

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

(Please Indicate if Pass/Fail/Pending)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are projects I completed without a partner.

### Sorting Suite: sorting algorithms

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/sorting-suite)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

We explored three fundamental sorting algorithms: bubbling, insertion and merge sort.

Notes/Comments/Feedback:
-Merge sort included several layers of recursion- difficult to implement, but elegant.

##### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Scores
##### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Functional Expectations
3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

##### 5. Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints


### Complete Me: prefix tries

### Description
Build a low level version of an auto complete system in javascript by creating a prefix trie that contains the dictionary found on my mac hard drive. I developed the game by applying TDD methodology along with mocha framework and the chai assertion library.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/complete-me)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Notes/Comments/Feedback:
-TDD was invaluable to ensure the code was working well for this project.
-Very useful to learn a new data structure.
-This was a challenging project for a front-ender because the program was driven from the terminal.

## C: Paired Projects

Below are projects I completed with a partner.

### Gametime: Snake

### Description
My partner Breanna and I created the game snake that is playable in the browser. We built the application in javascript using webpack. We developed the game by applying TDD methodology along with mocha framework and the chai assertion library.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/gametime-snake)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

##### Evaluator: Nate

#### Scores
##### Functional Expectations
snake gets longer, crashes into self and walls, keeps score, can play multiple games
3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints


### Weatherly: weather app

### Description
My partner Jenn and I built a weather app using javascript with the react framework. The app pulled weather data from the Weather Underground api using jQuery to make an ajax request. We created a UI to display the current weather as well as hourly and 10 day forecasts.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/weatherly)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

##### Evaluator: Nate

#### Scores
##### Specification Adherence
3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

##### HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS/Sass Style
4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

##### JavaScript / React Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

##### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
4 - Zero complaints

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Jenn:
Jenn was awesome to work with; she did a good job candidly communicating needs and wants during the project so that we avoided conflicts while working together. Because of this strong communication we successfully worked together in a driver/navigator setup for the first half of the project and then split up to work on separate parts individually. We ended up with a great product that we're both very proud of. During a few moments in the project Jenn got stoked about the code we were working on while I was driving and I could tell she wanted to jump in and type. She handled this well by eventually jumping on to her computer and getting her thoughts down there to avoid steamrolling me. I loved working with Jenn in part because of how much she enjoyed the project and her enthusiasm in general. This could bite her if she doesn't set hard deadlines for "pencils down" in the future to avoid having timelines and deadlines dragging on.

#### Feedback for Lindsay:
Lindsay and Juan were great to pair with on Idea box. I could tell they were interested in figuring out the challenges and not interested in just knowing the answer. I think this approach to problem solving with take Lindsay far at Turing and beyond!

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Jenn:
Anders was great to work with and I look forward to working with him in the future.  He has a firm grasp on the subject matter and is proficient at putting his ideas to work.  He is great at communicating and maintained pointed and effective communication throughout the project.

He is a very forward thinking individual.  While I recognize the value of looking 10 steps down the road, there are times that I would recommend Anders focus on solving the problem at hand before getting to far ahead of himself.

#### Feedback from Lindsay:
Bottom line, you were incredibly helpful to me and Juan when we had our heads stuck in the code.  Because of the questions you asked us about the code we had, we were able to diagnose the problem and solve it.  If I had any suggestions for improvement, I'd share them, but I don't, so thank you for the help!


### Playing a Part

I've tried to support and help build community within our mod by engaging in the discussions and gear up sessions- sometimes this is exhausting but I think it's worthwhile to help me grow personally and help our community gel more. I have also tried to help others in our mod when I'm not feeling totally underwater myself. Lastly, in Mod 2 I served as our student advisory board representative. I will continue to serve in this role in Mod 3.
