(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects were good and I enjoy being able
to work at your own pace. It's good for confirming
your knowledge.

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamos1/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description: This application requires the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Each of the previous guesses is displayed underneath the guess input field. Depending on the guess the game will display "too low" if the guess is too low, "too high" if the guess is too high and "BOOM" if the guess is correct. If the user guesses the correct answer an alert is displayed telling the user that the range has been increased by 10 on both sides. If the user is struggling to guess the right answer they can click the reset button and a new number will be generated.

Evaluation Comments:
- Work on the alignment and spacing to more closely match the integrity of the original comp
- More markup than you need, should look to refactor
- Refactor the header section with an h1 and a couple of spans
- Some redundant CSS (check out those inputs)
- Some good breakout of individual functions, but recommend refactoring your checkGuess function. It's a multi-nested if/else. Break it apart and go check out JS case statements.

Evaluation Scores:
### UX/UI Expectations

*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description: IdeaBox takes an idea from a user, allows the user to edit it after it's been generated and updates the edits to local storage. It also allows users to search all their ideas and hide ideas that don't match. Users can also rate the quality of their ideas through "upvote and downvote buttons".

Evaluation Comments:
- try to call functions in event listeners
- tidier comments

Evaluation Scores:
## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

- 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### CSS Style

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### Feedback from me to Zane Russell:
The interactions we've had have been great. They're really beneficial and improve my ability to get things done. I've appreciated your willingness to answer and try to answer a lot of questions I've had. You also help me stay on top of my game.

### Being a Community Member

While we didn't directly pair on any project this inning, I found you to be a great resource when I was stuck on anything. I really appreciate your approach to helping your peers in that you don't simply give the answer if you had already arrived at your own answer. You're very good at guiding someone towards their own answers, and thus they can learn from it, instead of just getting the answer and not understanding why. Keep it up my man.
