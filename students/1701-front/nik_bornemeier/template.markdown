B: Individual Work & Projects

Individually, I feel that my progress over the course of the MOD as increased greatly, and it is much easier for me to write code when I am not in an evaluation. However, I do not feel that I am ready for promotion to MOD 2. I feel it is in my best interest to have a better understanding of the fundementals before advancement.

I created a game where a user guesses a number between 1-100 and and the user receives feedback saying if their guess is too low or too high, or if the guess is correct.

Notes:

UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices. Fundamental CS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing. Fundamental JavaScript

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

C: Group Work & Projects

I felt that I was very lucky in that I was matched with three great pairing partners. I find I am able to work well when I am able to bounce ideas off of someone else, and I am generally able to add value to the team. While I do find it very hard to write JS or JQ when staring at a blank screen, it is much easier with another set of eyes. I feel that I worked well with all of my partners and was able to contribute to each pairing.

Projects

I felt my comfort with projects increased over the course of the MOD. In the future, I need to make sure I have a solid understanding of any aspects of the project that I am having difficulty with.

Feedback from Spencher

Nik was a great project partner and a huge help in the midst of projects. I knew that, even if we weren't working together directly on a project, I could always bounce ideas off of him or get help with something that I was struggling with. I have no negative feedback for Nik at all. I'm glad that I got to do a project with him and had no complaints about working together.

There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. HTML Style

Original Assignment
We took code from the IdeaBox project and created tests for the functionality using Selinium. Then we refactored the code and created a site to keep a list of too do items.

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

HTML Style

3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Feedback from Chris:

You have the intelligence and determination to make any function or layout possible. Also a design sensitive mind to certainly make a splash in this field. I see great thing in your future sir. The bad: you make others look so. But in all honesty, believe in your basic skills as a developer. Maybe its a lack of time to get comfortable with the basics, still, you are quick enough to keep up the pace with one with all the time in the world. Keep killing it Nik

D: Professional Skills

I can see how DTR's will be very valuable with every working partnership.

DTR with Chris Jordan
Gear Up

(CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap)

GitHub URL
This was my favorite Gear Up session. As a group we came to the conclusion that, while we may not see the gender gap based on our experiences at Turing, we need to be aware of situations in our future careers where sexism, etc. may come up and things we can do to help combat those issues. Overall I found the documentry greaat as well as the discussion in my small group.

Giving Feedback

Feedback to Bucket: you were great as a project partner and of all my partners this mod, I definitely learned the most from you. You were always quick to explain any concepts that I was having trouble understanding. You also did a great job of NOT steamrolling me. Thanks again buddy!

Feedback to Travis Gregory: You and I did not work together on any group projects but we did work together on other projects such as Mythical Creatures, etc. You are always quick to help and not to proud to say if you don't know something and steer someone down the wrong path. You have a great understanding of Javascript and were gracious enough to help me on multiple occasions. You will not only be a great developer but you are also an exceptional teammate and friend. Thanks for all the help!
