# (Daniel Bucket) - (Mod1) Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

JavaScript/React/Sorting Algorithms
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I found that I accumulated a deeper understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Honestly, I wish that I had pushed on through to Mod2 before repeating. Repeating Mod2 would have been far more beneficial than repeating Mod1.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: pass
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: pass
* **D: Professional Skills**: pass
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: pass

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
To start with, I found Mod2 to be easier to manage. The JavaScript fundamentals I had received in Mod1 were given a chance to take root and grow. Sorting algorithms in particular were essential to getting a base level understanding as to how recursion works, as was the CompleteMe project. React is still fuzzy, but I was sick like a feral animal during that time so what can you do?

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Sorting Suite)

(A self learning program capable of containing an entire dictionary of words and providing suggestions for words previously used)
Probably the coolest thing we built this mod. This is what like.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
(Intro)
I have participated in several paired projects. In each I found the workflow and partner cohesion increasing in effectiveness.


#### (Game-Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielbucket/bucketZane-Tron)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

(description)
For this project we built a game. It was fun I guess. It was the second time I've done this project. Being paired a the class brain-child, I was able to focus on other aspects that I had previously been fuzzy on. Don't ask me what those were, that was a long time ago.

#### (Weatherly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/db-lk-weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

(description)
Weatherly is an app that utilizes an api and some local storage all based on React. It's a weather app for finding the weather forecast for a given location.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

##### Growth Mindset

(takeaways from session)
* Everyone is talking about it! Every time someone in the coding community gives a talk, Carol Dweck comes into the conversation. It's all the rage. And, to be fair, it's for a good reason. I've always wholeheartedly agreed with her point of view. Though, I do still think that there's some validity to the old adage "you can't teach an old dog new tricks". The caveat is in the work "can't". I would rather rephrase it as "you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, it's just harder now". But learning can still happen. At least I have to believe that if I want to continue moving forward in this intimidating new world.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Feedback

(feedback from me)
* Leta Keane - I was impressed by your determination to see the project through, and your patience in dealing with my frantic steamrolling. You continued to work hard despite feeling super lousy, and kept showing up, which I really appreciated.

* Breanna Knight - Pairing with you via video chat was a smooth operation. I appreciated how you took any feedback by reacting not by being offended, but by either defending yourself and/or understanding why I gave the feedback I did. It made for a comfortable and effective pair session.


(feedback to me)
* Leta Keane - I was impressed by your determination to see the project through, and your patience in dealing with my frantic steamrolling. You continued to work hard despite feeling super lousy, and kept showing up, which I really appreciated.

* Breanna Knight - I was extraordinarily pleased to have had the opportunity to work through some of the final questions. I felt comfortable and at ease with receiving feedback and exploring ideas and concepts. The exchange of time and knowledge was appreciated and made for a thorough understanding of the presented coding challenge.


### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
* After week one, I hosted a half-hour session on macBook and Atom shortcuts for Mod1 students. I made myself available for paring with Mod1 students, but after no responses in the first three weeks, I just stopped. No one seemed interested.
