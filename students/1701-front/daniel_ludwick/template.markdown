## A: End of Module Assessment

From 1611 - (Mod1-Round1 has been a hurricane of information. I found it difficult to keep up with the material. Pairing proved a very helpful tool especially when working through Mythical Creatures. In Mod1-Round2 I'll focus more on utilizing jQuery, something I hardly dabbled with in Round1. I am repeating Mod1, but not for lack of informational resources. Class structure, student integration and the emphasis on community involvement have been key factors my (limited) success throughout the mod.)

1701 - Grasping and understanding the foundations of JS have been much improved this time around. While the mod still flew by and I found it difficult to keep everything in track, I was still able to focus on the things I really needed to improve on. CSS, however, still alludes me and I'd feel content to let it were it not an important facet of a front end developer. Though, the more time I spend with JS and CSS the more I'm interested in backend development.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first assigned project proved a helpful introduction to basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML flow.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
(Intro)
I have participated in several paired projects. In each I found the workflow and partner cohesion increasing in effectiveness.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Pam Lovett: Try not to be so hard on yourself! This stuff is VERY difficult and everyone is struggling with something different. Although I can speak for myself in saying that I do appreciate your willingness to be verbal/open about feeling frustrated with the material. It helps me remember that I'm not alone in wanting to pull my hair out.
Keep your head up and make sure you continue to see that bucket as half-full! We are all going to get to the place we need to be.. however painful the process will be.

Marissa Reinke: You never cease to amaze me with your determination. I have no doubt you will be an amazing coder by the end of this program.
Sometimes you are a little too hard on yourself and I think if you did something outside at least once or twice a week you would feel a lot better

Franklin Crosby: I love your enthusiasm and work ethic. It was great to learn all the short cuts (atom) that you know.
I would love to see you give your self some more credit. We all learn at a different pace and you definitely have what it takes. Give yourself the time and space to absorb it all.
You were very open and a joy to work with. You constantly kept the mood light and productive.
You are great! I look forward to pairing with you again.

Kyle Zucker: Bucket's got it. His progress has been phenomenal and his work ethic goes far beyond most. His ability to take a problem and make it his own and find his own way thru it is inspiring.  
Don't hold back. If you think you can do it, then do it. If you think you can't do it, then do it anyway.
Keep it up. You're a good dev.
