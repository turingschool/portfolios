## A: End of Module Assessment
1701 - Grasping and understanding the foundations of JS have been much improved this time around. While the mod still flew by and I found it difficult to keep everything in track, I was still able to focus on the things I really needed to improve on. CSS, however, still alludes me and I'd feel content to let it were it not an important facet of a front end developer. Though, the more time I spend with JS and CSS the more I'm interested in backend development.

From 1611 - (Mod1-Round1 has been a hurricane of information. I found it difficult to keep up with the material. Pairing proved a very helpful tool especially when working through Mythical Creatures. In Mod1-Round2 I'll focus more on utilizing jQuery, something I hardly dabbled with in Round1. I am repeating Mod1, but not for lack of informational resources. Class structure, student integration and the emphasis on community involvement have been key factors my (limited) success throughout the mod.)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first assigned project proved a helpful introduction to basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML flow.

Challenge #/3 was a project intended on honing in on CSS skills with particular focus on FlexBox and responsive handling. Also, I don't like to talk about it.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
(Intro)
I have participated in several paired projects. In each I found the workflow and partner cohesion increasing in effectiveness.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.



### Professional Development Workshops

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Ciara B. - You did a great job of making things easier to understand and were very patient with helping me and walking me through concepts and checking in to make sure you weren't going too fast. I also appreciated that you respected that I wanted to do all the JS together so I gained a lot in that project. you were really patient with me and it was great that you were always thinking of new ways to try something new. You were willing to keep pushing on even when some things weren't going as planned and it all worked out! I also felt like you did a good job of slowing down and letting me explain it back if you started working on something more advanced. I learned a lot working with you!

Karen - Work on listening to your pairing partner, even if it means stopping work and closing your computer. If you are going to make a bunch of changes to the code, talk to your pair before you make the changes instead of after.  Once the changes are made and the code still works, most people won't say just throw away your work.  Asking for forgiveness instead of permission is not really a trust building exercise in this case.



### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Being a repeat offender, I was able to help alleviate some of the weight of the sudden onslaught of information by hosting a couple lunch session Macbook keyboard shortcuts. And I'm always willing to set aside what I'm doing to help out my classmates.
