# Justyna Winiarska-Field - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The goal for this module was to gain solid JavaScript fundation, develop higher JS skills and understanding, expand logical thinking, learn to manipulate large data and get exposed to more advanced development.

# Sorting Suite

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/sorting-suite)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

## Evaluator: Nathaniel

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

// would like to see use of destructuring to swap values
// array.concat in merge sort

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

// generate random large data arrays
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints



# Complete-me

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/complete-me)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

## Evaluator: Jhun

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

# Game Time

*   [Game](https://justynafield.github.io/game-time/)
*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/game-time)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

## Evaluator: Jhun

### Comments:

- UI is hilarious
- Loved the sounds and the experience of the game
- Would love to see logic broken out of World and move things like game rendering and starting to a game class
- move some of the collisions to block // a collisions class
- Would like to see more tests for World if the majority of responsibility stays with world.

### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


# Weatherly

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/weatherly)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

## Evaluator: Nathaniel

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

### HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS/Sass Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

### JavaScript / React Style

* 3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

### Testing
* 3

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for John B: 
It is always very inspiring for me to see how you pay attention to every detail and really make sure that every piece of the code is very well understood. It is great to see the incredible progress you’ve made since the last time we worked together. I think that you are a very respectful partner and also very supportive. I like working with you because you always make sure that we are both on the same page and nobody ever falls behind. Just like before, this was a very good pairing experience. It would be great to work together again in the future. 

#### Feedback for Jack B:
It was great working with Jack. I appreciate how we approached the new subject and patiently worked through challenges together. I like how we discussed code problems and tried new solutions. I feel like we’ve learnt a lot while working together. Jack was very dependable and respectful. I would like to work with Jack again in the future.


### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Jack B: 
Working with you was really enjoyable. Weatherly was by far the hardest thing we’ve been asked to tackle at Turing thus far, in my opinion. You maintained a very cool head throughout the whole project, and we’re really good at keeping us on track when we were about to go down the rabbit-hole. It was really rewarding to finally get components to render on the page. I hope we get to work together again in the future.

#### Feedback from John B: 
Working with Justyna the second time around was great again. Just like the first time, we had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind. I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me. It was great seeing how much she had learned and grown since our first paring.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started. I would be happy to work with her again.  Also, our game was awesome! 


### Playing a Part

I have been trying to be involved in the Turing community as much as I could. I've been developing relationships with other students. My future goal is to be more actively involved in building the Turing community.
