# Karen Kepner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During module one I set out to learn the basics of front end web development.  Along the way I improved my HTML and CSS skills, gained Javascript skills and learned about Test Driven Design.

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Very much improved in terminology and ability to work with functions
* Still a little trouble tracking in fundamental concepts of how data gets passed around between functions and where to declare/call variables
* Speed is slow, but markedly better than a couple weeks ago

### Progression/Completion

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 2.5: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

This has been a rough couple of weeks for Karen, she was very shut down during this assessment. She was trying hard to participate and collaborate but was clearly struggling to do that and was in a headspace that made fully engaging in the assessment highly challenging. This impacted overall performance, I get the impression that she does understand more than was reflected in this assessment but her mental state is a huge blocker.

Needed many prompts and assistance to keep moving forward, seemed to track along and take suggestions well.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Solid effort and work, needs the final push to get to a completed layout. Very close, just needs that last pass to make it polished and really get it solid.

### Design Integrity

- 2.5:  Nearing completion but the layout is still rough and in need of polish. The comp is missing major design elements and/or incorrectly applies design with respect to any number of major deviations across color, layout, sizing, imagery, graphical spatial relationships.

### Responsive Layout

- 2.5:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens, but the layout is still rough and breakpoints need polish. The design is compromised at either extreme of small (mobile) or large (flat screen) size.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

### CSS Style

- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.



## B: Individual Work & Projects

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
I sent feedback to several other students.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)
- I could tell that your confidence around the project material was not too high, but I thought you did a really great job pushing yourself. In terms of scheduling and being understanding you were a great partner. You taught me a ton just by asking a bunch of questions and coming up with different ideas of how to do things that I hadn't considered. You used your strengths in CSS and HTML to help the project along. And I very much appreciated your reminders to go outside and walk!!

- It has been really nice getting to know you.  I really like what you're able to accomplish with CSS and many could benefit from your knowledge about the subject.


### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Paired with students in my cohort to solve difficult problems.  I attended several Pahlka posse spikes and will join the group next cohort.

I contacted other students for the Lunch Roulette. Sometimes we were able to connect and I enjoyed meeting more students here at Turing.
