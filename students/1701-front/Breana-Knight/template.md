## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects
* Complete-Me
* Sorting-Suite
(These projects featured computer science aspects in order to create a sorting-suite and prefix trie)

# Sorting-Suite
* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
(An exploration into bubbleSort, mergeSort and insertSort)

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

5. Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints



# Complete-Me
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AKewlBreeze/complete-me-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)
(An introduction into creating prefix tries)


1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

// use this.find in your select function --> 3

2.5: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
* Game Time
* Weatherly

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

# Game Time 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/gametime-snake)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

(A throwback to the classic snake game)

Functional Expectations

snake gets longer, crashes into self and walls, keeps score, can play multiple games

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

(feedback to me)


# Weatherly
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
(A project that delves into the robust features of React)


Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up 1
#### Communicating and Understanding Others Experiences

This gear up revolved around internal reflection as well as understanding people experiences different than your own. People make assumptions based on the way I look. However, there are assumptions that I make about others in the same regard. 
There are experiences that I will never understand and didn't think about like people coming from broken homes and how that impacts them. There are many others but it is interesting to think outside the box to question the impact of experiences outside your own understanding of challenges. 


### Gear Up 2
#### Grit
A topic common and needed for survival at Turing. However, I disagree that people having too much grit is a bad thing. I think people not staying within
physically healthy parameters and blaming it on grit is common, and I think removes the individual from the responsibility they owe themselves to be healthy. 


### Gear Up 3
#### Animation 

I absolutely agree that animation will change the world. What we will know as capitalism and this system that we have all been brainwashed into will crumble. Probably not in our generation,
but it will happen. What it will be remains unknown, it could be wonderful, it could be terrible but it will change. 



### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

* [Workshop URL]()
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/AKewlBreeze/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-f/breana_knight.md)

(Being nicer to myself has helped with improving confidence and work effectiveness.)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
Johari Window Results - Able, accountable, clever, driven, friendly, hardworking, honest, indepdent, intelligent, logical, proud, relaxed, responsive, self-conscious, sensible.
  - These responses from partners and pairing sessions were helpful. Most of these are clearly positive. However, there are a few things that are questionable, such as proud, and I'm not sure if that is a positive or negative aspect. As well as self-concious. I would most certainly like to work on my confidence as I move through the program and gain more experience. I need more experience and successes to be more confidence and that will come with time. 

Daniel - Pairing with you via video chat was a smooth operation. I appreciated how you took any feedback by reacting not by being offended, but by either defending yourself and/or understanding why I gave the feedback I did. It made for a comfortable and effective pair session.

### Giving Feedback
Anders (game-time) - It was an absolute joy working with you. You were pleasant, well organized, thoughtful and positive. The whole learning experience was fun. I enjoyed our whiteboarding sessions and working side by side for 90% of the project was new for me and I enjoyed it. Thank you for your time and I look forward to potentially working on another project together. 

Travis (weatherly) - You are a hard worker, considerate and open to seeking help when needed. It was a pleasant working experience. I do wish that we had communicated better while working independently to have avoided doubling up working on the same portions of the project so we could have accomplished more. 

Daniel (pairing) - I was extraordinarily pleased to have had the opportunity to work through some of the final questions. I felt comfortable and at ease with receiving feedback and exploring ideas and concepts. The exchange of time and knowledge was appreciated and made for a thorough understanding of the presented coding challenge.



### Being a Community Member

(Attended and contributed to gearUp talk sessions and took part in whiteboarding sessions)

### Playing a Part

(Attended evening events, lightning talks and represented the Turing community at the Lesbians Who Tech Conference)
