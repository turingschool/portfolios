# Game Time 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/gametime-snake)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

(A throwback to the classic snake game)

Functional Expectations

snake gets longer, crashes into self and walls, keeps score, can play multiple games

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints

(feedback to me)


# Sorting-Suite
* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
(An exploration into bubbleSort, mergeSort and insertSort)

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

5. Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.  


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

* [Workshop URL]()
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/AKewlBreeze/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-f/breana_knight.md)

(Being nicer to myself has helped with improving confidence and work effectiveness.)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(Videos to review at later points has been helpful. Allowing to pay more attention to the lecture rather than resolving errors while live coding.)

### Being a Community Member

(Attended and positively contributed to gearUp talk sessions)

### Playing a Part

(Attended some evening events and represented the Turing community at the Lesbians Who Tech Conference)
