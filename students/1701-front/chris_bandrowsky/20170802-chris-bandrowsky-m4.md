# Chris Bandrowsky - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

- Learn the backend! This goal is to focus and get a better understanding of server-side code and writing database queries and endpoints. 
- Get better at technical interviews and coding challenges. 
- Reflect on knowledge learned and see where I can improve.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (BYOB)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/byob)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)
* [Heroku](https://cb-cardata.herokuapp.com/)

BYOB, or Build Your Own Backend was a project to do just that: build our own backends. The goal of the project was to gain a better understanding of building a backend, including everything from setting up Express server files, to making migrations, seeding data in a database, to writing API endpoints. I chose to create my Backend project based on my Personal Project in Mod 3. I ended up seeding somewhere around 10,000 entries of car data and car trims.

### Projects

#### (Capstone: MadTalk)

MadTalk is a game that brings more shenanigans back to the MadLibs genre. MadTalk is an app that allows a user to input new nouns, verbs, and adjectives into a randomly selected text sample through typing input, or through voice. The application uses a backend to store text-samples, words, and each word's index and part of speech. In order to get these details, the application makes a request to a language API to identify the specific word's part of speech. Once that is determined, the application presents a user with a number of options to replace the word of to create a totally different text sample. In its current form, MadTalk does a great job at skewering and making fun of Romance novels.

Score: Pass

#### (Jet Fuel)
SWApi Box was a project which focused on displaying Star Wars data based on categories. It focused on doing several api calls to get accurate data. User's could click cards from varying categories

#### (House of Vars)

House of Vars was a group project where we were tasked to attempt to make a contribution to an open source repository. The goal was to help us as junior developers get a better understand of large codebases and understand how to find what we are looking for in someone else's code. In addition, the project also taught us about proper ettiquette and best practice when in comes to making public commits or issue request help.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up: 
For Mod 4, we were tasked to lead a Gear-Up session and encourage conversation among other members of cohorts below ours. Our topic of conversation was concerning Coding Schools... or Coding Fools. Our topic jumped into our story of getting to Turing and succeeding at Turing, and turned into conversation about the kind of skills Turing is giving us, and the type of careers that Turing is preparing us for. We focused on how we can be supportive and develop lifelong careers in a field that is often changing. 
The Gear Up went really well, and there was quite good conversation to be had about the topic. Everything from discussion about traditional to non-traditional education, the rise of potentially 'Blue Collar' developers, discussion on specific soft skills Turing prepares us for that other schools tend to lack, etc.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
Playing a part was a lot more difficult this module, especially due to the amount of assignments, projects, and the job searches that were going on all at once. My biggest point of playing a part this mod was acting as a mentor of sorts to the new formed Hopper posse. We used our posse tie to talk about Turing struggles, Turing successes, code challenges, and the like. Within this environemnt though, I began to act as a knowledgeable source to discuss problems, get code feedback, and simply share more about my Turing experience. 

### Feedback for Me from Colleagues
From Laura Turk regarding Jet Fuel: 
- Second time working with Chris.
- Better experience than the first time. 
- Stop doubting yourself
- Be more diligent and research and view the docs more. 
- Be more willing to step in to help with colleagues are struggling.

### Feedback to Others: 
Feedback about experience to Posse Colleagues: 
- Be prepared for anything to go wrong on a code project, because it might. 
- Stay motivated in the darker times by doing things YOU need to do to be comfortable and recharge.
- Always be willing to open up to your peers.
- Find a Turing staff member that can act as a mentor and leverage that connection. 
- React is freakin' sweet.
- Don't be afraid to reach out to opposite programs for help and discussion.
- Cold Outreach sucks, but lukewarm outreach is really nice. Find people you know or have met previously in a coding environment or a tech environment and see where those connections can take you. 

Feedback to Laura Turk on Jet Fuel:
- Enjoyable to work with.
- Glad second time around went much smoother.
- Personality clash when stress is high: figure out a way to calm down self or other parties. 
- Thanks for honesty about what I can do to avoid the spiral.
