## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work this mod consisted of Sorting Suite and Complete-Me. However, they were not as individual as the name would make them out to be. While the goal of the projects was to gain a greater understanding of the key logical fundamentals of Javascript, the added bonus was being able to use our cohort as a resource. There were whiteboarding sessions galore. Brainstorming, psuedo-coding, and testing possible solutions, our cohort really came together and worked as a team to accomplish the challenging logic of the two projects. It was enjoyable to work in such a capacity. 

### (Sorting Suite)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/sorting-suite)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The goal of Sorting Suite was to get a greater understanding of alogorithms through a sorting algorithm. Rather, not just one, but three different algorithms. We created a Bubble Sort, an Insert Sort, and a Merge Sort. Each had their own method of sorting data, and each optimized data sorting in its own way. Merge Sort proved to be the fastest most reliable data sort. 

##### Evaluator: Jhun

* Evaluator Notes: None

##### Evaluation Scores:

#### _Fundamental JavaScript & Style_

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### _Test-Driven Development_

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

#### _Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### _Functional Expectations_

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### _Code Sanitation_

* 4 - Zero complaints


### (Complete-Me)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/complete-me)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me was our second individual project with a focus on data structures and algorithms. However, this project helped us understand the nature of Nodes and Tries. We created an autocomplete system which would auto guess the next character of a guessed word. If a word was entered multiple times, that word will be auto suggested and pushed to the front of the suggestions.  

#### Evaluator: Nate

#### Evaluation Scores:

##### _Fundamental JavaScript & Style_
// only use returns when needed, use objects vs key values in strings
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### _Test-Driven Development_

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### _Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_
// pass dictionary into populate for 3.5
* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### _Functional Expectations_
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

##### _Code Sanitation_

The output from ESLint shows…

## C: Group Work & Projects
Group projects this mod were limited to Gametime and Weathrly. Both were two week tasks to create working and functional applications, with an added focus of helping us greater understand the core concepts we were reviewing at the time. 

### (Gametime)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/gametime)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For Gametime, my partner and I were tasked to create a game in HTML Canvas. The game we decided to make was Breakout (the brick breaking game). The Project helped us gain a better understanding of using Objects in Javascript, especially objects that know and interact with each other. 

#### Evaluator: Nate

#### Evaluation Scores:

##### _Functional Expectations_

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### _User Interface_

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### _Testing_

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### _JavaScript Style_

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### _Workflow_

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### _Code Sanitation_

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### (Weathrly)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/weathrly)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

For Weathrly, we were tasked to create a weather application. We were able to get data from a Weatherunderground API call, and append the data to the DOM using React. The app displayed the Current Location, the 7 Hour forecast, and the 10 Day forecast, all by allowing a user to input a location. 

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Evaluation Scores:

##### _Specification Adherence_

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### _User Interface_

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

##### _HTML Style_

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### _CSS/Sass Style_

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

##### _JavaScript / React Style_

* 3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

##### _Testing_

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### _Workflow_

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### _Code Sanitation_

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
Turing has done an excellent job in teaching me interpersonal skills that can apply across the industry and across professional developer interactions. Through Gear Ups, casual conversation, guest speakers, and otherwise, I've learned a great deal about functioning as a Developer in the work world. Additionally, my interactions with members of the tech community have gained me greater understanding of industry trends, interview advice, and 

### DTR

Defining the Relationship was an invaluable step for ensuring our pairing success in projects throughout the module. DTR's are useful for determining how my partner and I could be the best partners possible.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### Giving Feedback
##### Feedback for Chris Jordan
"Chris was a super awesome person to work with on Gametime. We both worked great together, whereas it be in a pairing environment, or, on our own individually. Chris is a super smart guy who had a knack for coming up with ingenious solutions to our problems. It was easy to follow his logic and his coding ideas. Chris can make complex ideas seem simple, and does an excellent job of making others understand those ideas with ease. 10/10, would work with again."

#### Receiving Feedback
##### Feedback from Chris Jordan on Gametime
"Chris was a great partner to work with. Highly capable and could trust him to follow through on work needed. Very patient in explaining his thinking process and very imaginative. Great with design and the know how to structure it. Can grasp complex concepts with ease. He has a future in this web developing thing."

##### Feedback from Evan Miller on pairing between 1701 and 1703 (excerpt from survey)
"For me, talking it out, using someone as a 'rubber ducky' helps me tremendously. The pairing was great, I think pairing with you was beneficial in helping me understand javascript.

##### Feedback from John Binning on mod work (excerpts from survey)
"Though we didn't officially pair, I sit next to Chris everyday.  He was very helpful overall. Chris was always willing to help me out when I didn't understand something.  His help was critical to not falling behind during lessons. In regards to future mods, you're actually pretty decent at this, believe in yourself more."



### Being a Community Member

#### Playing a Part

Edited profile headshots for classmates after taking headshots the last mod. 
Helped out by offering pairing sessions with members of 1703. Had three sessions: one with Josh Thompson from 1701 BE, one with Evan Miller from 1703 FE, and one with Kristi Green from 1701 FE
