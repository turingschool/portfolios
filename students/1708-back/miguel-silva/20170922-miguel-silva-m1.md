## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
My goals this module where to solidify my knowledge in ruby and learn how to work in a team environment. I entered ruby with a strong understanding with the basics of ruby, but needless to say, I learned new things everyday. To be more specific and to mention something that's a little more personal to me... I started with a typing speed of 10 wpm when pairing with other people, but now I've successfully reached 37 wpm in any scenario. For me that was a huge improvement and I feel like its definitely a victory for my professional career. Knowing my personality, I know that I will work on it until I can reach the same typing speed that I have when I code by myself which is 45 wpm.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggle the most when it came to pairing and talking about my code while I worked at the same time. Sometimes, because of my rough english I get stuck. But eventually I learned that with dedication and perfect practice I overcame those obstacles little by little. I became more comfortable as time moved on, and I also learned that I need to practice until I couldn't get it wrong anymore, but instead I practiced until I got it right.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was complete me, because it thought me about trie. I feel like its a very important project in order to understand more about programming languages. I also got to practice more on my pairing skills. As for my least favorite project, its hard to pick, because every single one of them had their own level of complexity, but if I must chose, I would chose the sorting suite, because it was short and yet tedious.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
From the independent projects I learned to figure things out by myself, at the same time I learned that the best work environment for me is a quiet place were I can focus fully on the project at hand. I was made more aware of my strengths and was able to practice it even more.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
In the paired projects I learned the importance of teamwork and the value of communication. Since in this career you will always have a group to work with, this is an important skill to develop. I learned to understand and respect my partners thoughts and work ethic. I learned to adjust to other peoples work habits while helping and demonstrating my work skills and habits.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite gear up was the introvert and extrovert exercises. It teaches the different types of people there are that surround us in our corhort, its also my favorite because at the same time it teaches us how we will be dealing with others in a real work environment. It was definitely an eye opener on how people see each other. My least favorite one unfortunately was the cognitive resources exercise. I feel like the person in the video had a very monotone voice and it was hard for me to focus especially while in the middle of a heavy project thats hard for me to concentrate on anything else.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
This module I contributed to the Turing community by helping a lot of people in my cohort, specifically in their projects. Not only did I offer my help to my mod 1 peers, but I was also able to provide assistance to a few upper mods as well. I contributed by starting tutoring sessions every Thursday night to help my fellow mod 1 peers catch up. In the future I plan on not only continue to offer my assistance but I plan on expanding the tutoring sessions by creating a "big'bro, lil'bro" system to help my peers and those who are beginning their journey at Turing.
