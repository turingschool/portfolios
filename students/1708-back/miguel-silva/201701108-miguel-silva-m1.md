Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
My goals this module was to try to push myself as far as I could. I set really high standards for myself and try to learn as much as I can. I successfully  accomplished every single one of them except for one which I am currently still working on. Overall it was a good learning experience.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
In this module, I struggle the most with not overbooking myself and trying to slow down. I found myself a lot of times trying to learn new technologies and ended up rushing to finish projects sometimes. I learned that it is good to push yourself, but is also good to find a good pace.

Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was little shop because, it thought me a lot and it was very different. My least favorite was the mini project because, I did not have the time to make something I was proud of.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
From my independent projects I learned many different ways of doing things. Since, my main goal was to learn something new every single project, the independent ones gave me the flexibility to try new things.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
The paired projects showed me the importance of working in teams and that many things can be accomplished much faster with good partners. Also it gives you a great insight in how a real job scenario will look like.

Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite Gear up was the Cold Outreach one since it showed us how to communicate with future employers. My least favorite one was the feedback 3 and the only reason why is because, Allison and I already had a meeting that talk about feedback.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I helped the module 1 students by give them spike talks and showing them how to properly read documentation. Also I helped my cohort by making myself available as much as I could.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I will like to be part of the code fair and be helpful to the new cohort and module 2 students. At the same time try to help everybody around me by becoming a better version of myself.
