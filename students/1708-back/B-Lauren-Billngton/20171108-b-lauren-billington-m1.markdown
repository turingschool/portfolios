# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

###  What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to learn as much as I could.  I think I was successful with learning, and I also hope that I learned enough to move on to the next mod.

### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Honestly, I struggled most with social relationships and some other emotional problems.  I guess I've learned that my fears about what others think of me takes up a lot of my cognitive resources and I need to address it while I'm a student so that I can be successful here and successful again in a workplace. During the next Inning, I'm going to try and meet with my therapist on a weekly or biweekly basis so that I can try and deal with my issues as they arise.

## Projects

### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I liked all of the projects. I thought it was really cool doing the Blogger project to see how comments and tags worked since it was totally new to me. I liked doing Job Tracker and IdeaBox, and I have enjoyed Little Shop. It was really interesting to learn how carts can be made in Rails, and then realizing that you can use sessions to store other things (we used it to filter pages).

### What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned a LOT.  I forced myself to use TDD on IdeaBox and by the end of it I saw a lot of value in it. I'm excited to keep learning things and building things.  I may try and build out an idea over the break.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned that I need to stand up for my needs -- especially if my needs are the ability to learn and contribute. People may get frustrated at me, but who's to say they won't get frustrated at me anyway.  I am responsible for my education and there is no one looking out for my needs except me.  On the positive side, I have also learned that daily retros can be a really great tool in keeping lines of communication open in order to communicate needs/frustrations or compliments, as well as tracking process and contributions.

## Community

### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
If the 11/3 sessions count, that was my favorite. I attended the session on using tech to make a difference in the world.
I'm not sure how I felt about the squares vs triangles Gear Up.  I think the examples were a little too simplistic, but that you could still glean some lessons from the examples. I felt torn about it because I didn't think it hit the aim of what it was trying to do  -- create empathy in students.  Our class had some really interesting discussions afterwards.

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I tried to help reinvigorate the LGBTQ group.

### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Keep trying to reinvigorate the LGBTQ group.
