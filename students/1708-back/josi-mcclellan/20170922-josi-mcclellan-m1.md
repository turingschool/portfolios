## Areas of Emphasis

##### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I didn't come here knowing which areas needed focus, but for future modules, I have a good long list.

##### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
As I just answered in the "Strengths and Storytelling" deliverable, my biggest struggles related to with gender, guilt, and storytelling.  That's not to say the coding was a breeze, just that those things were so so very intense.  Code-wise, I struggled most with testing and with finding various balances, e.g. brevity vs. expressiveness vs. performance.

- As to testing, I won't say I'm %100 converted to the TDD lifestyle yet, but I think I've made sufficient progress for mod 1.
- As to balances, I've learned the need to tailor the code to the context.  Sometimes, one ideal does simply overrule another.  Other times, balance is key, and I don't think that's something you can study.  It just takes instinct from experience.  A related thing I learned is that I've gotten some pretty dirty coding habits ingrained, so getting that instinct might be harder for me than for most.

## Projects

##### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
##### What did you learn from your independent projects?
##### What did you learn from your paired projects?
- ___Credit Check___: Come on, this one doesn't count.

- ___Date Night___: I *started* learning some great lessons with this one, especially about better encapsulation, and that what's expressive from me to me is not expressive from me to others.

- ___Complete Me___: Really fun. Adrian and I did really well I think, he was a joy to work with, but the functionality (can't spell it without fun üòÅ) was over pretty quick.  After that, it was mostly agonizing over tiny naming and syntax choices just to have those aspects torn apart.  Not disagreeing, just saying I kinda wish I'd tried less hard at the naming on that one, because if I didn't really know what I was *aiming* for yet, then did that time even serve as good practice?  For that, too much extra effort seems a bit wasted without extra feedback.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Well, it was pretty cool anyway.

- ___BattleShip___: Bigger project.  I like.

- ___Black Thursday___: It was pretty awesome working with Emily over the longer term of this project and getting to see her grow.  Those `good`s are enough outweigh the `bad`s of data oddities and a spotty spec harness.  Emily and I didn't mesh as immediately as Adrian and I, but we certainly got there by the end, so that was a great learning experience.  Also, I really tried to focus on better human organization, and learned a lot about git workflow and such.

## Community

##### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I'm not sure it counts as a gear-up, but the gender gap documentary and discussion was my favorite.  As much as I've heard and read about the topic, there always so much more to learn.  I want to be an ally to women in tech, and you can't do your part to fix a problem that you don't understand.  The discussion afterward generated good insights.

The storytelling gear-up was my least favorite.  It could have been one my favorites if I'd handled it better, so this isn't a criticism of anything but myself, but I clearly didn't like it very much.  I've been trying to keep a growth mindset with regards to storytelling though, and I hope to be really solid *before* mod 4.

##### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
It's so hard to say the effect but I think I helped my class with coding, and I tried not to impart the bad habits I learned by studying on my own.  I was thanked for helping guide people toward solutions without actually telling them what to do.  I think I've been a positive presence socially as well, but that's harder for to tell.

##### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Mostly the same things I contributed this module, but better because I've learned how to interact with people better.  I also look forward to being there for 1710-B.
