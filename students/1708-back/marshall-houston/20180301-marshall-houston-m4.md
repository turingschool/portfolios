# BE Mod4 portfolio
## Marshall Houston

Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

# What was your biggest achievement of the module?
My biggest achievement of the module was pushing myself try new languages and technologies and to learn them at a deep level. When I started Turing, I didn't have any programming experience, so as I learned Ruby, my entire scope of computer science and programming was contained in a single language. I kept up as much as I could, but, for example, because I struggled to complete some homework, I didn't have a deep knowledge and appreciation of concepts. Once I started learning JavaScript, I had a conceptual grasp on more CS fundamentals, so I was able to understand the nuances of a new language at a deeper level.

I loved the chance to look at computer science and development from a more holistic view in this mod, and I knew I wanted to learn technologies deeper than only the surface.

I accomplished that.

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled to balance post Turing with "now" Turing. I've always thought that I had the discipline to be focused on the here and now, and I've utilized strategies to help manage these tasks (timers, changes of environment, narrowing down focus to a specific task). Something was different this mod. I struggled to compartmentalize learning for now with preparation for the future. I felt paralyzed, like I wasn't able to be successful at either planning for the future and succeeded in the present. I kept asking, "Was it worth it to change careers? What are you looking for? What do you want to do?" I felt like I didn't have satisfactory answers.

I decided to name the focus of each part of the day, and I was able to concentrate on that single area. I decided to focus on learning.

Looking back, I realize I had shifted my focus on the end of Turing as a judgement day of sorts -- either I was good enough (for what?) at that time or I wasn't (again, for what?). That misses the point. Yes, I'm excited to finish Turing's curriculum. But this point in time is a marker along a continued path of learning.

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I've focused on building the Turing community. I joined Turing largely because of the community, and I believe strongly that the community is dynamic. Each person has a role to play and opportunities to impact the broader community, so I wanted to make use of the limited time I had left as a day-to-day member in the community.

I gave a lightning talk on the learning process at Turing. I mentored multiple Mod1 students on a weekly basis, and I worked with students from all mods on a variety of issues. I've built capacity in other students to carry on the Pahlka posse. Each time, I encouraged folks to take an active part in building the broader community, both in the current mod and in future mods. That's the power of Turing, and I believe I've played a role in strengthening this community.

# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I really enjoyed working with front-end technologies because of the power front-end technologies have in influencing movement--of the DOM, of data, and of the user. Ultimately, this made me appreciate back-end for the ability to provide data in specific ways that make it easier to process and to use. I'd love to work on projects that give developers and customers the opportunity to make meaningful change, and I think I can accomplish that more directly by starting in the back-end. I really want to continue learning front-end development on the side or on personal projects, but I'd like to start on the back-end.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

I'm taking the belief that I have the skills to learn and to learn quickly. I can contribute by focusing on process and asking questions. I know I may not be confident in each of these areas all of the time, but I can recognize when I'm in this negative space and shift my thinking back to the task at hand. With this knowledge, I can tackle new problems with excitement and curiosity and become a better developer.


The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)

https://gist.github.com/marshallhouston/707733a3715413a2491361446de88f49

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
