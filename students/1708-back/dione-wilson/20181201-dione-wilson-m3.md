>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
* This module has been a little intense, though, there are many factors that make it feel that way. 1. It feels like by the third module your starting to feel the effects from such an intense learning environment. 2. Breaks fell weird so maintaining a routine was difficult. 3. The content is heavy because ultimately we are becoming job ready after this module. Overall, my experience has been a good one and I'm beginning to feel more like a developer solving more complex probelms and piecing together more robust applications. My experience working with groups and individual has better prepared me for "real world" in my opinion.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

Ethics of Open Source: This topic was really interesting to look at the different views and opinions of others and form our own thoughts. Open source makes learning much easier, however the line between what are concepts that are open and what an actual product is can be difficult to define. Looking at what motivates people to contribute to open source is also facinating.

Attention Economy: It in a concept that is beneficial to be aware and monitor how my own attention is being spent.

Microagressions: The information of how to navigate conversations that may be difficult to have is valuable in a professional and personal environment.
