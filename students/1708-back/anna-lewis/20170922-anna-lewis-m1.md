## Areas of Emphasis

##### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My two main goals this module were (1) learning how to code and (2) learning how to live. I think I've made strides towards learning how to balance work with my personal needs and I feel like I am comfortable with the concepts taught throughout module 1.

##### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The most difficult concept for me so far at Turing is learning to accept imperfection. I come from a traditional learning background and implementing the growth mindset emphasized at Turing has been a challenge. In previous schooling, all I could focus on was getting that A; anything less was failure and any more work was wasted time. However, as I move into the growth mindset I find myself pushing project boundaries but also dealing with the less-than-perfect in a much healthier manner. One specific example of this is the BattleShip project we were asked to complete. During that week, I found out my parents were getting a divorce, had a medical issue and also caught a cold alongside that. I ended up missing nearly 3 days of class. When I went in for my project eval, I did it knowing that I hadnâ€™t implemented all of the functionality listed in the assignment guidelines and that my code could be better. However, I also did it knowing that I had matured enough to go to sleep at a reasonable time in order to recover. I did it knowing that sometime in my future work, I may have to launch a project that I have deemed up to standard. While walking into that eval was one of the hardest things I did, I think I am better for it.

## Projects

##### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project this module was Date Night because it really introduced me to recursion. Making that switch from iterative thinking to recusive thinking was difficult be also helped expand my thinking.

My least favorite project this module was Battleship, but I believe that was mainly because I couldn't dedicate the time to the project that was necessary to have the deep level of understanding I was hoping for. This led to a final product that I was unsatisfied with, and I'm hoping to pick this project up again in order to fully understand the concepts.

##### What did you learn from your independent projects?

Through independant projects, I learned that I really have to check myself. I can get wrapped up in trying to solve a problem that I wouldn't realize that hours had passed until I reached the 'straw that broke the camel's back' and went from content problem solving to extreme frustration. Next module I hope to work on implementing a problem timer to maybe avoid some of these pitfalls.

##### What did you learn from your paired projects?

Through paired projects, I learned that in order to truely succeed, I need to communicate my working style to the other partner. Being that I have issues with depression and anxiety, I have days where I am extremely productive and days where I get 'negative work' done. With my partners, I have had success communicating this often and early and have been able to take the time I need on a bad day in order to get back to the productive day faster.

## Community

##### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was the one on growth mindset. I have found that I both try harder and feel less stressed in this environment where the focus is not on some arbitrary bar, but rather on my own progress and where I want to go. In the past, I have always hit the 'arbitrary bar' and simply stopped improving. Here, there is always something I can do better.

My least favorite Gear Up was the one on 'getting better at difficult things'. I think I either misunderstood what the speaker in the video intended, or I disagree with her concept on cognitive load.

##### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

This module, I contributed to the turing community by cleaning up the kitchen when I could, trying to stay updated in my classmate's lives and working on decreasing the microagression of saying 'you guys' when refering to a group.

##### What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Next module, I would like to work on connecting GDI with the Joan Clarke society to perhaps host a code & coffee event or a class at Turing.
