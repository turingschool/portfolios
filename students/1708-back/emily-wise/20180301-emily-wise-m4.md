##My Mod 4 Story
To steal the plant metaphor from Josh, one would think that the natural progression from surviving Mod 3 and being exposed to the elements, would lead to a plant/ flower ready to face the elements of being a real developer. But then we entered Mod 4, with an entire new language and and what seemed to be a new process for developing.

In addition, to being exposed to a new language, I had admittedly had a fixed mindset going into Mod 4 regarding client-side development. I had often not focused on UI development, and leaned on Bootstrap and had very minimal styling in past projects.

So to set the scene, I went into Mod 4 nervous about Javascript and an entire 6 weeks of focusing on an area I had so strategically avoided.

#### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

As I described my mindset going into this final Mod, my biggest achievement was starting at a very low point and leveling up to produce a strong front-end in React for my capstone.

The first week, was a struggle. I was dealing with some personal life things, on top of being overly frustrated that I was not grasping concepts like event delegation, targeting, traversing the DOM. After the pre-work, I felt ok with using Javascript in a similar fashion to Ruby with Mod 1 type logic problems. However, moving on the using Javascript in the DOM I felt lost and defeated.

However, I paired that first week to feel more comfortable, and dove head first with my partner into Quantified Self. Concepts were starting to click and solidify.

Not only did I level up my skills with the Quantified Self Project, and was able to not only quickly grasp complex problems using React, and implemented it in my capstone.

Technically, I successfully should competencies in the following areas: This and Binding, Constructors, Event Listeners, Props and State, and Debugging Techniques.


#### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

One the struggles with Mod 4, was feeling the pressure to search for a job on top of gaining confidence learning a new language and framework. From week 1 to 3, I felt stretched thin, defeated.. And very frustrated that all my efforts were not going to pay off. I saw myself starting to spiral and lose confidence.

I identified that it was really affecting my mental state, so I worked the last weeks to remove some of the pressure I put on myself and flip my mindset.

I learned that part of life is giving you obstacles to you cannot control, and that growth is uncomfortable and exhausting. I often feel that the pressure I put on myself drives me to success, but I learned that it can also drive me to be not successful and affect my ability to perform.

#### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

Part of how I combated the struggle I felt with job searching, was continuing to find ways to be an active member in Denver Tech community as well as continuing to follow my passion for civi tech projects and contributing to those groups.

My hustle to build a community is what sets me a part this inning. Especially given the demand of the curriculum, I kept to staying very active and successfully met all technical expectations. Throughout the inning, I continued to connect with coffee dates, as well as went to at least 1 if not 2 Meetups or tech events each week. One of my greatest strengths in connecting and collaborating with different groups, I am excited to continue to build my network outside of Turing and work with developers and community builders that want to keep creating and inclusive community.

In addition to hustling in the external community, I focused on transitioning the Civic Tech resource app to lower classmates, and successfully worked with FE students to design an MVP. I am also very excited to work on the GoCodeColorado team.


#### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

My experience with Capstone, demonstrated the need to be very thoughtful with designing a backend API application. As in, be thoughtful with response and error handling. and being thoughtful with error handling and designing the appropriate responses. Using React too is a new way to think about moving data and gathering inputs from a client. The other large learning from Mod 4 was that I learned how to program not just how to program in Ruby on Rails. Learning Javascript, Node, and React demonstrated that I have the skills and capacity to tackle problems that are foreign.


#### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
The most important skill I learned at Turing, is how to develop a process to tackle something you don’t know YET-
- 1. Understand the problem
- 2. Frame the questions and research
--	Use tools we know like Stack overflow, Documentation, Tutorials
- 3. Reach out to your network to see if your idea makes sense
- 4. Define small steps and test.. Refine… keep on going.
