## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

 My goals this module were the following:
  - Build on my knowledge from Mod 1 on OOP
  - *Read Sandy Metz and other OOP books*
  - Focus on ActiveRecord and using the methods to build out analytics
  - *Learn the basics of how the web works*
  - Be able to build a web application and get comfortable with Rails
  - Focus on following the TDD process, and seek ways to make testing more robust
  - Continue to refine Git workflow and use Waffle.io and other agile project management tools - for both personal and group projects
  - *Focus on learning how to quickly use my environment, shortcuts, atom, etc.*
  - *Work on personal projects outside of the normal work to continue to explore what I am interested in and refine skills*
  - *Start to blog and create online voice and presence*
  - Restart to the Pahlka Civic Tech group at Turing, and start working on a project
  - Pair more frequently with current mentor, and reach out to additional mentors for more pairing in Mod 3. I also want to develop a targeted networking plan over the intermission which will include the companies I am interested in and find contacts to reach out to for cold networking.
  - *Make sure I am keep my energy level up and not let anxiety and confidence impede in my learning this module*
  - Be more confident that I belong here are I can be a strong technical programmer

  The goals that I did not personally meet are italicized. Some of the goals were stretch goals such as working on personal projects, but there are still many areas that I can focus on next module to improve on as well and carry over some goals into the next module.

  Overall I think I was successful this Module, and I really enjoyed reflecting back on how much I learned over this 6 week period. I continued to focus on following TDD in projects, as well as focus on learning more about ActiveRecord and how to use it with our database to produce meaningful analytics in my applications. I have a good foundation with Rails and how to build CRUD functionality. I am much more comfortable working with Git. I also think I was very successful at group projects. We also started the Pahlka group, and I am very excited to continue to explore civic tech and build a resource matching application and use different languages that I am not practicing currently- like React and Graphql. I do feel that I was more light-hearted this Module, but I can always work to improve my confidence level.



#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled most with styling this module as well as feeling organized in the personal projects. I still feel that I really need to focus on speed and shortcuts with my computer. I also want to continue to focus speed with completing the code challenges and in person assessments. I don't ever feel that they are a true reflection of my comprehension, so I would like to continue work on overcoming errors and nerves. I also really wanted to push myself to have a personal project as well as do more outside of the standard curriculum. I struggled with time management to be able to complete my projects and be able to have time to focus on other things like blogging, personal projects.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I loved BikeShare and LittleShop. I find it most enjoyable to work on group projects, just because I love collaborating and find that I learn so much more in a team where we can push each other. I also enjoyed that Bikeshare used a robust data set, and really enjoyed using ActiveRecord for the analytics.

  I also enjoyed the Gif Generator, because I was proud that I pushed myself to consume an API.

  My least favorite project was Job-Tracker. I found that I was able to get the functionality, but I was not able to style it, which was personally frustrating. I also felt that it was very close to the Blogger tutorial.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
  How to use Feature tests to drive the development of our applications. To not wait until the last day to style, style and create templates early on. I also learned that using you can create a Rails New API application, which is a skinnied down version and should not be used if you are trying to consume an API because the sessions won't persist.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I work much better in a group and really enjoy the collaborative environment. The first project really showed me how important it is to use project management tools like Waffle.ie and define a specific git workflow to ensure that the development process is efficient. I also learned that time-boxing is really important and that as a group we can work to hold each other to it. In LittleShop, we identified that we all tend to be stubborn which can slow down our development process because we may spend too much time trying to figure it out on our own. By identifying this, we have all worked together to challenge each other to jump into debugging tools quicker, which has really helped to speed up the

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite Gear-up was the Tragedy of the Commons, because I think this is a really powerful topic that just identifying biases will not fix the disparities. Many people did communicate that they felt that the example was simplified, but I actually thought it was a very powerful game as an introduction to inclusion and diversity training.

  I still really enjoyed the gear up about privilege, mostly because I think it is very important and I respect my classmates so much to feel comfortable to share. But I would say this was my least favorite because there didn't seem to be an actionable takeaway.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I was active with Joan Clarke Society, and ran a session this module. I also worked with Aurora to re-start the Pahlka student group. I also worked to be available to students in Mod 1 from both a coding and mental health stand-point.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to continue to be an advocate for Pahlka. I would also like to go out of my comfort zone and present something at the code fair and even think about doing a lightening talk.
