## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
**Overall** : My goals this module were to develop a strong foundation for object oriented programming, and to develop an understanding of how to write clean adaptable code. Looking forward and to the application of these new skills in a profession, I want to really learn how to write not just functioning programs, but programs that can withstand change. I came in with little to know experience, so this module I want to learn the fundamentals and develop good habits of correct ruby conventions.

 I also wanted to be all in on the process, and be present, and to have faith in the process and pedagogy, knowing I will be uncomfortable with not being able to fully dive into topics, read all the things, etc.

**Tools**: My goal was to be more comfortable with using tools like git, Github, Waffle.io, my mac, terminal, etc. I wanted to get more comfortable with my Mac environment(this is my first time using a mac), as well as not be scared of computers and technology (I know.. weird that I chose Software developer program :) ).

**Ruby Concepts**: I wanted to come away with a strong understanding of classes, objects, modules, methods, and how to appropriately breakdown problems into appropriate objects, methods, etc. I wanted to use TDD to write programs. I wanted to be comfortable manipulating and storing data. I wanted to focus more on understanding why to use certain methods, or data structures to approach a problem over memorizing particular ruby methods etc.

**Community & Professional**: I wanted to find my leadership style and get comfortable with being at the elementary level of a profession again. I wanted to be open to other people's point and view and take feedback constructively. I wanted to learn how to pair with different work styles. I wanted to start to build my network in a new industry and city.


#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

**Overall** : I struggled a lot in module 1, but I wanted a challenge and embraced the challenge because it does bring growth. I have always been a very strong traditional student, and was considered a consistent top performer in my last roles, so struggling for 6 weeks and feeling like I am at the bottom, was a very humbling experience. I would often get frustrated too when I felt that I was understanding concepts well, or how to approach and breakdown the problem, but felt that my projects, or timed assessments were not representative of my effort or knowledge. I have struggled a bit too, with stress management.

**Tools** : I feel that I have become increasingly more comfortable with Git and Github with Black_Thursday, but I would like to learn more about using git and Github. I think this is an invaluable tool moving forward. I need to continue to learn how to own my operating system- more shortcuts, atom, etc.

**Ruby Concepts**: I struggled with deep nested hashes, and how to write methods to appropriately access and manipulate the needed data.

**Breaking Down Logic** : I tend to struggle at times with how to start breaking things in small pieces. I am also stubborn when I get stuck, and tend to spend too much time on one method or problem. I also struggled with time-boxing, and time management.


## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite projects this module were the paired projects because I not only really advanced my technical ruby skills in both instances, but also really learned how to collaborate in two very different dynamics. I have a very strong technical partner for Black_Thursday, and have enjoyed learning more advanced ruby syntax, and be able to talk over the logic of the problems. I also enjoyed working with real data and learning how to build methods that can parse and manipulate the data. We have also established a good git workflow, as well as how to use Wafflie.io to accomplish chunks when working remotely.

I also enjoyed working on Night Writer. For that experience, I was technically the stronger pair, so it really helped me to have to be able to take a step back and explain certain concepts.

My least favorite project was Battleship, which I think is because I didn't finish, which was a very hard thing to come to grips with. I really enjoyed the freedom to think about how to create the classes and break the logic down, but I did not feel like I had enough time to get functioning clean code, which was very frustrating, and hard to feel like I didn't fail.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to break things into classes. How to apply the 4 pillars of OOP. The importance and benefit of pair programming. What TDD actually means! and why we test. I also learned that I need to write robust tests with edge cases- this is from the Perilous Journey where some last minute refactoring broke a lot of functionality that was working but produced false positives with the tests I wrote.   

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to collaborate and use different tools to manage the process. I also think the DTR process is also a really important tool, and it helps to re-DTR to ensure everyone is aligned.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite Gear Up Sessions were the Debugging the Gender Gap and the Mod 4 student run session on Transhumanism. I found both topics to be very interesting and engaging. The Debugging the Gender gap was a great film, and I thought it also brought some great discussion to the class. I think the movie also helped to provide good facts to lay the context for the conversation. I also really enjoyed the discussion on Transhumanism, the session was very engaging and loved interacting with students outside our mod.

My least favorite session was on Working Styles. I think that there are very large differences between introvert and extrovert, but I think there are other more important differences to talk through that are more applicable. Like how you operate in stress, etc. Or how as an NT, you process and synthesize and process data at a different pace then SF.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I was very active in all the Gear ups, and have made an effort to connect with almost everyone in my cohort. I have also taken advantage of all the other groups, like Joan Clarke and Pahlka Posse. Myself and another member are looking to restart the Pahlka student group as well. In addition, I have been involved with the broader Joan Clarke Society outside, or Turing, and look forward to continuing to connect with alumni and mentors.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to pair with mod 1 students, this was something that was so beneficial and I look forward to paying it forward. I also look forward to co leading the Pahlka Student Group, and becoming more engaged with the Joan Clarke Society.
