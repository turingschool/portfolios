## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
To learn the things! I think for this module, I was really just hoping to 1) pass the module and 2) make sure that I had a good foundation for my time at Turing.  I feel successful in that--I don't always know the most efficient way to do things, but I think I have a really good conceptual understanding of how different aspects of programming and Ruby work.  I feel that I've developed a lot with problem solving.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle? I struggled a lot with a lot of things, but I think my most significant struggle was against my own perfectionism.  It's hard for me to produce imperfect work, as cheesy as that sounds, and basically everything I've done is imperfect--whether because of lack of time or lack of knowledge.  And I always know that I could do more/better, so I have a tendency to get frustrated with what I'm doing if it feels too messy, or to get caught in rabbit holes.  I'm not sure that I've figured out the solution for myself yet, but I think working under these project deadlines is at least a good way to force the issue--I've had to make lots of choices about what to prioritize, and for me, I think getting comfortable with that is probably my biggest takeaway.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I honestly liked just about every project--Black Thursday is cool, because it feels more like real-world applicability.  CompleteMe was just a pretty fun project overall--I like a lot of programming because I like seeing what happens under the hood of things. Ironically, CreditCheck Recheck was really cool--it was cool to see how tiny it actually was, and how much I'd learned in just a few weeks.  Battleship would have been cool with infinite time, but in the week that it was assigned, I was just in a complete panic.  It just felt very logically complex and I just felt the time crunch and imperfection of that project so much more than the others. I started over 3 times because I was so disgusted with it...anyway, it ended up fine. But it was stressful!

What did you learn from your independent projects? How awesome everyone in the Turing community is! Everyone is super willing to help.  How to google for ruby things.  StackOverflow and Ruby Docs finally make some sense to me.  Time management/prioritization of project aspects. And I think most of what I've learned regarding Ruby probably comes from just the work from completing projects.

What did you learn from your paired projects? More of the interpersonal aspects--it's very different working on a project as a pair versus independently, with different priorities and so on. I think most I just learned the importance of being a team, and of being able to express yourself in whatever way makes sense at the time.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why? I thought the gender session was great--that documentary was awesome, and real, and we had some interesting conversations in the reflection following.  It's interesting even hearing the difference in takes between men vs. women regarding some of the issues covered in the movie.  Least favorite was the introversion vs. extroversion one--I've already soapboxed on the topic in feedback surveys, but I just don't believe that introversion vs. extroversion is the key lever in interacting with others, and I think it perpetuates frustrating, if not potentially detrimental, stereotypes.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module? I brought food during Week 6! Stress eating aside, I think I contributed mostly regarding cohort culture--I think I was able to connect with a number of people in our cohort, and to advocate/be a support for others and others/ideas and feelings as things were challenging.

What would you like to do to contribute next module? I want to pay it forward with all the help I got from upper mod students with the incoming Mod 1. I'm super grateful for how generous everyone is with their time, so I want to make a commitment to do the same for others.
