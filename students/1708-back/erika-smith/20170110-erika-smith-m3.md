## Areas of Emphasis

> \This was a really interesting mod for me. For the past two mods, I have been more socially involved at Turing and in a lot of ways, I think it took away from my progression as a developer. This mod, I decided to focus solely on developing my programming skillset and professional development, and I think it has made me far more ready for the real world.

>* \As explained above, my community involvement really wasn't as high this mod as before. In some ways, it just shifted - I met with mentors for the first time and developed cold outreach skills.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \Focuses on consuming and working with data from an API.
>* \APIcurious was, for me, the most difficult project. Even though it was pretty small, it was the conceptual barrier that I struggled with the most. In the end, it taught me how to develop a process and was a good exercise in my patience.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \Created a successful web application from a project idea.
>* \My learning goals with this project included developing a plan and wireframing. I went into it with a problem to solve and I found what I think is the most simple solution. My project didn't use a ton of crazy new tech, but it did provide a meaningful solution to a problem I care deeply about. This was a really good exercise on dream driving a project and seeing features through from start to finish(which has been rare given the amount of group projects).

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \Uses Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
>* \I loved this project. I had a great partner and we got through it with a lot of laughs. I think my main takeaway with this one was less technical, and more about just remembering to not let challenges stress you out.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \Pivot to allow multitenancy and implement spike features.
>* \I liked this one. I liked that it was really a two part project- making the base project multitenant, then implementing spike features. I don't feel that it was the most technically valuable learning experience this mod, but I definitely understand the value in exposure to a brown-field project.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\I think my favorite gearup this mod was the attention economy. I felt that it was extremely valuable information and led to a lot of interesting discussions. I also really enjoyed my mod4-led gearup, which was 'be your own ally'.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

#### **Posse**
  >* \We mostly used the time to chat about where we were all at in our mods and some challenges that we faced during the week
  >* \My mod is very supportive and each member makes a conscious effort to check in on each other.
  >* \It provided a meaningful connection for me to people in other mods that I might not have gotten to the chance to get to know otherwise.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \I've been trying to increase the amount of pairing I've been doing. It hasn't quite taken off, but it's something I would like to focus on more next mod.
