# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to concentrate on being comfortable with being uncomfortable. By that, I mean that I am aware that working in this industry will require me to basically never feel like an expert in what I'm learning and I'll need to be able to detach from those concepts. I was relatively successful, but it was definitely my main struggle this mod. I think what I learned was to trust in my own capabilities.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I feel like I learned the most from my rails mini project. It was a good lesson in determining the scope of a project and building something functional from the group up. My least favorite project was Bike Share because I really never felt comfortable with the framework and had a tough group dynamic. Ultimately, we got through it in a positive way and I'm satisfied with the outcome of our project, but it was definitely the least enjoyable for me.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

The biggest thing I think I learned this mod, and especially in my independent projects, was how to TDD in an effective way. I TDD'ed with minitest in mod1, but I actually used RSpec as a guiding force. I also learned how to feel confident splitting up a project into a manageable work schedule and using an actual git work flow.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Git work flow and how to pair remotely. Previously, I had only ping-pong paired.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I liked the last one that was led by Mod4. I went to the cold outreach one and felt like it was really useful information.
My least favorite was the paradigm/polygons exercise. I felt like it pointed out a problem that was pretty obvious but it never really got to discussing solutions. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I'm actually really disappointed with myself in this aspect. Victoria had asked me at the end of Mod1 if I would be interested in taking over the Turing podcast, and I never seemed to have enough down-time to give it attention. I am hoping I will be able to do so over the intermission.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
