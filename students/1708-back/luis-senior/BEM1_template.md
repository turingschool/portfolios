# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  Passing the module for starters, but honestly I just wanted to be able to finish week 6 feeling 120 percent confident about my ruby knowledge before diving in to module 2. I was not successful unfortunately.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with keeping up with the curriculum. I like to marinate in the new subjects taught so I can fully wrap my head around it and feel comfortable that I'll remember it enough to use it later.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project was Flashcards. I felt like Flashcards challenged everything I've learned in module 1 and best of all it's a functional program I can later use myself for studying. My least favorite was battleship because it was way out of reach for myself.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  How to get things done on my own and challenge myself on what tools Iv'e learned and how to use them towards my goal.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  How important communication and teamwork is to accomplish my goal.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
The one where we all split up in to introverts and extroverts. It physically kept us all engaged making lists and graphs.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  Participating in group activities.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  Help others more with questions on projects.
