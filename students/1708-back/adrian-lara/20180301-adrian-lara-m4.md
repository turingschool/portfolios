# M4 Portfolio

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
> My biggest achievement in this module was learning & using a new language, some related frameworks/libraries, and DevOps tools.  No single one of these can be considered the "achievement", but rather, I'd consider the achievement to be the general learning. Along with the class lessons, I was able to really push myself to learn via docs, tutorials, and blogs.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
> I struggled most with learning the DevOps tools. Since in-person resources weren't as readily available, I mostly relied on documentation, blog posts, and my own personal trial-and-error to support my learning.  This was an especially steep learning curve to traverse, but the struggle taught me that I was capable of making such a climb.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
> I don't know the details of everyone's experiences or learning outcomes. But I can say that my curiosity and interests have always driven my independent learning, and through this mod, I don't think anybody shared the same interest in DevOps tools as I have. So in a very tangible sense, I think I've set myself apart with learning those types of tools.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
> Having learned front-end concepts in this module, it was awesome to learn as well as enjoy the process of learning a new language.  This fact has impacted my career in that, as of now, I'd love to find myself in a full-stack role.  Before this module, I was open to it, but I definitely couldn't say I'd love to take on that type of role. It was incredibly interesting to learn the nuances and patterns that were both different and similar to what I had learned in the past.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
> The most important lesson I'll take from Turing into my next job is the importance of accepting and facing the uncomfortable.  This was something I got to experience continuously over the past 7 months, and from it, I grew both technically and personally.  I was able to work through the challenges of learning new technologies.  I've allowed myself to have difficult conversations with others.  I've practiced stepping out of my comfort zone, having grown from those experiences, I know can say with confidence that this is something I'll continue doing in my next job.
