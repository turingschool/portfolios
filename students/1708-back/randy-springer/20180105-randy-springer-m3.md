-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/randy-darsh/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
Recreating GitHub user page through the GitHub API
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I was a great introduction for me about how APIs work. It was really cool seeing the work on the page.
And, I appreciated the intro to VCR even though I didnt use it much after this project. It is a very useful tool.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/randy-darsh/squatch_watch)**
>* \<Description>
A data visualization and information app for helping find the infamous Sasquatch.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
It was a really cool experience. I learned a lot. There is a lot more information out there on Sasquatch than I knew.
I didn't as much done out of the as I wanted. But, I want to build this out more and maybe even show it to the BFRO and they can update their site finally.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/randy-darsh/rales_engine)**
>* \<Description>
Creating an API backend out of Etsy sales data.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I think this was my favorite project. Purely backend. Great use of ActiveRecord and JSON.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/hmorri32/the_pivot_base)**
>* \<Description>
Update and improve an existing Little Shop App
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
My favorite part about this was implementing the live chat support. But, my takeways were that this is closer to what we will be doing in real life.
It was a lot of little things. Tedious at times. But, it really helped solidify my learning in a lot of areas.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](Ethics in Open Source. Mod 4 Student led GearUp)
They brought up a really good point about how we all benefit from open source. I think that contributing to open source is important because of that.
We use open source all day every day. Whether it's a Gem or the actual language you are using.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  Met once a week. We had project work time a couple times. A Q/A panel with some mentors and just a social meeting another time.
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  The Q/A panel we had with the mentors
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>
  It's good to meet and talk with people from both sides of the programming world.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>
Just little things like picking up garbage, cleaning up dishes and walking around helping random people with problems or questions they had.
