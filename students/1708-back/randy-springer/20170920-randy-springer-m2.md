# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

To PASS! AND YES! I also just wanted to learn as much as I could so that I could progress to Mod 3 and be sucessful there as well.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I didn't really struggle that much to be honest. It was more of a self inflicted struggle. As I started falling behind in work BECAUSE I wasn't struggling as much. So I pushed a lot of things off and as a result of that it made the last 2 weeks a lot harder than they should have been.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I think I was the most successful with Job-Tracker. And Gif Generator once I finally finished it. It felt good to actually complete a project for once. As, last time around I dont think I completed a single one. My least favorite was Bike Share. But, that is just because I already knew Rails was awaiting me and it was hard to go back and remember how to do it the Sinatra way. But, I actally enjoyed working on Bike-Share the most as weird as that may seem. Just because of how much work I put in with the testing. It REAAAAALLY made me better at Rails in the end.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

That I can do the thing! It was actually enjoyable. Although, Gif Generator was a lot more than I had expected. I definitely underestimated it. But, I am happy with what I accomplished. Geocities Bootstrap!

What did you learn from your paired projects?

That I really feed of of other peoples motivation to get things done. But, I also feed off of peoples lack of motivation to get things done. It was not a problem this time around but it is something I realized about myself from doing this twice.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was the student run one "Don't take yourself so seriously." Which, is actually not something I really have a problem with. Although, I would say speaking in front of people, I have a hard time letting go of the anxious feeling. I also really liked the Cold Outreach one. Because I am terrible at that as well.

My least favorite was the Feedback III one. And not even  because it was bad but just because I had done it already and didn't get much out of it the second time.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I helped out with a few of the students. It really helped solidify that I finally know what I am doing. Plus it feels good to help other people out who might be struggling. Just like I was previously.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I think I need to help out more people more often. It's good for them and it's good for me.
