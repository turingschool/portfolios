# Hugh Morrison - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I've always wanted to learn the MVC architectural pattern and specifically, I've always wanted to learn rails. 
My primary goal this module was to hammer home the foundational information that I knew,(as it pertained to ruby and backend design) to bolster my understanding of the MVC pattern, of the web, and of Ruby fundamentals, and to integrate myself even more into the Turing Community.

I believe that I was successful at accomplishing what I set out to. I understand MVC, I grappled with Rails, I learned new and exciting technologies and protocols, and etc. What a fantastic module. As far as integrating msyelf into the turing community, I had the absolute pleasure of Co-leading the kay posse and attended numerous meetups. I attended weekly meditation sessions, paired often with students from both the front and and backend programs, and made myself available as often as possible.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled the most with understanding Rails and the subtelties and nuances that developing in rails requires. The built in methods, the so called rails magic, the helper methods, the structure, the asset pipeline, and so on were extremely foreign to me and quite hard to grasp. 

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I loved little shop. I had a fantastic group, we worked on an exciting storefront, implemented ultra robust and cutting edge features, and had a blast. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to embrace the suck. The independent "mini" projects were not so mini and definitely involed a tremendous amount of work. I will say that they were infinitely useful and i learned a tremendous amount. 
What did you learn from your paired projects?
Collaborating in a several person environment is tough when it comes to programming. I learned some neat ways to solve merge conflicts, I learned some very cool project management strategies, I learned (some more) Rails conventions, how to build a cart, really fascinating code related stuff. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My most favorite gear up was the one that was led by mod4 students. I attended the session on blockchain. It was led be enthusiastic students who were well informed about the topic at hand and that made it a lively and fulfilling session. I can't say I had a least favorite. They were all enlightening and important.
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I co lead the kay posse, i made myself available for pairings with both front end and back end students, I showed up at denver tech meetups, learned many invaluable lessons in gearups and posse led spikes, I attended weekly meditation sessions in Clarke Hall. As always, I had planned on doing more but I was simply stretched for time. 
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to lead a posse again, i may nominate myself for SAB. I plan on being around campus more, on attending more Turing sponsored events, on getting to know more of the people here, and on venturing beyong the confines of our classroom more often.
