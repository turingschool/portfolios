## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Biggest achievement was gaining a deeper understanding for javascript and how to use it to enhance the user experience.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Working with Golang definitely provided the most struggle. Learning how to do most everything by hand as opposed to ruby doing it for you was incredibly beneficial though.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

Got a job! I put more focus on the job hunt than most of my peers and that paid off.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

My Mod 4 experience with front end technologies did not influence or impact what I wanted to be doing after Turing however I did appreciate and enjoying getting better at doing cool front end stuff.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

How to build software with rails.
