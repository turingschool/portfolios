# Matt Bricker - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

##### What did you set out to accomplish this module?

In this module I set out with only one goal - not to repeat. As I progressed through the module my goals definitely changed, reflective of my level of aptitude with the material.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**:   NA
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**:      3
* **D: Professional Skills**:        2
* **E: Community Participation**:    3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

NA

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I worked hard on each project submitted. Next time through the module, I will seek minimal outside help to complete projects.

##### Project Description

In this project I created a flashcard program used through the command line. In this program, a user is able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

###### Evaluation Comments
3 3 6 7 Variables and methods nicely named Length of methods & lines is good

###### Evaluation Scores

###### Feedback to Me
Hey Matt! Thanks for all your hard work during the project! You were willing to come in on the weekends and stay late after school each day to work and that was awesome! Our driver/navigator sessions were always productive and our problem solving helped us get over each of the humps. Going forward, be willing to try different solutions and try attacking a problem from different angles with the idea that code is cheap and you can always delete it if it doesn't work. Thanks again for all your hard work and patience throughout the project!

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

####  Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

* In this session I learned that talent can be cultivated through hard work, strategy and effective input from others. With this mindset, you set yourself up for higher achievement than if you operate with a fixed mindset - the belief that talents are innate gifts. I absolutely want to  to worry less about looking smart and put that energy into actual learning. During this module, sometimes I would avoid seeking effective help from instructors in fear of not "looking smart."
* Here at Turing, rewarding effort, and chasing the feeling of reward that comes with the struggle, are critical to my success. I firmly believe that adopting a growth mindset mentality will lead to good things.
* I want to use these strategies to continue to battle any negative narrative that inhibits my learning. Writing down negative thought patterns helps me realize how ridiculous and unrealistic they really are.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

* Ta-Nehisi Coates' article really resonated with me, especially when she talked of "being convinced that (she) had some kind of brain injury" that prevented her from learning French vowel inflection. I have often thought throughout the module that "maybe I hurt my brain somewhere along the way." She attributes the real enemy to be the "feeling" of despair, not an actual physical or neurological issue. Managing my emotional health will be key to my success at Turing, and improving at any difficult activity throughout my life. The feeling of "stumbling around in the dark" is all about getting better at stumbling.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

During this session I grouped with people that leaned towards introverts - most of my group identified 60/40. I honestly didn't really know where I stood and took a stab in the dark when evaluating where I fit in. As I moved through the module, I noticed how this seemed to change. Not only in specific environments I encountered, but also as I adapted to my new life as a student here. Through this session I learned the importance of understanding the difference between these two tendencies, and how this understanding can help get the best out of others.

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

In this session I was really able to isolate tactics to aid in stress management. Trying to stay positive, hydrated and rested are key! I know it is very important for me to recognize when to step away - when to take a moment in time of high stress. I also need to find some time for myself to normalize, or recalibrate myself with music.


#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

Taking a few minutes to visualize what brought me here and render it with a pink marker onto paper was a surprisingly rewarding experience. Sitting down and actually drawing a "life story" with a magic marker is definitely not something that I would have actually taken the time to do if not for this session! It was a great opportunity to relax and tune out anything draining and reflect on all of the wonderful things that have brought right here to that moment in time.


## E: Community Participation


### Playing a Part

I love the sense of community here at Turing, it truly is one of the greatest assets of the program. At one point in the middle of the module, I really sensed helplessness from someone in my cohort. In reaching out at the right moment, I was able to pull this person out of that dark place they were hanging out in. Taking a moment to leave a space around campus more orderly than when I arrived is also something I find satisfying.
