### 1801 Mod 4 Portfolio

**What was your biggest achievement of the module?**  
For me the biggest achievement was definitely the capstone. To have, in essentially 1 week, created a functioning app in a relatively new language and framework felt great. In addition to the Django/Python practice I was able to experiment and implement quite a bit a JavaScript and jQuery. It was very satisfying to create something that matched the vision I started with, and that my friends are are actually using. And while I had to rush a few parts and ended up with some less than optimal code in a few parts, I feel proud of how I used the project to hone some of my non-technical skill such as time-boxing, version control and project planning. On top of all of that this is the first project I actually know that I will continue to work on moving forward. I have a solid road map for more iterations and features, and I look forward to building Adventure day into exactly what I want it to be.

**What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?**  
Hands down JS, particularly around promises, caused me the most issues. Aside from getting used to the strange JS syntax, it took me a minute to wrap my head around the client-server side interactions and data flow. Conceptually I thought I had a decent understanding, but actually implementing it proved to be another story. That being said, ultimately I was able to get a handle on promises using async & await, I built out an internal api to manage my client-server interactions. It also forced me to learn some security practices regarding secret management if the client side needs to make requests using secret keys. I also learned that repeated practice of something that infuriates me is a solid way to get an understanding of a concept.

**What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?**  
Enjoyed working with AWS. A little bit of a joke, but many of my peers seemed to have hated working with AWS. I saw it as an excellent opportunity to learn a tool which is pervasive in the industry, and instead wanting to fallback onto technology I was already familiar with(Heroku), I utilized the docs and got everything working.

I've also made sure to stay in close contact with both of my mentors. It's been extremely helpful for learning new concepts, and has helped from a networking perspective.

**How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?**  
Working with the front-end this mod, specifically JavaScript, has been a real back and forth experience. I came into Turing with JS and Python at the top of my learn-alongside-Ruby list. Every time I work with JS I am impressed by the capabilities and seeming ubiquity of the language, but it feels very unintuitive. Ultimately the experience has made me more confident that I should learn JS.

It didn't so much reframe as reinforce that I want to work on the back end of applications. I really liked working on the QS projects because not only was it great practice to implement the same solution across 3 languages/frameworks, but I was able to work with a distributed app, understand the front end, but not actually have to design it.



**What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?**  
Planning and designing. Without a doubt one of the things Turing has helped me improve on the most is structure. I have always been drawn to learning and implementing new knowledge, but it often had a free-wheeling and unguided approach. Practicing with iteration road maps and user stories has been very helpful, and I look forward to maintaining an agile process mindset moving forward.
