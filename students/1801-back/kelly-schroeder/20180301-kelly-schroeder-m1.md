# Kelly Schroeder - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to begin developing my skills as a programmer. My understanding of the curriculum heading in led me to believe that I would end module 1 with a decent understanding of Ruby basics and GitHub. I feel confident in my abilities as they relate to GitHub, Atom, and my terminal. I also, feel that I am where I should be with Ruby in order to move on to Module 2. I know that I still have plenty of room to improve across the board, but especially as it relates to TDD and best choice enumerables.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment with all 3s.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really enjoyed the project work this semester. I felt that they provided a variety of challenges and tools, and even though the Date Night and CompleteMe projects were similar the latter added a lot to what needed to be learned. HTTP server was my least favorite, but only on account of no clear instructions on how to get TDD to work and not lock up when running the server.

/ /hello /datetime
/word_search

takes the word directly, not as key value pair /start_game /game
Prints out /force_error /shutdown
Testing:
3 tests
Struggled with how to run tests with server Stopped writing tests from there

Runner class does a lot. Most of it in one single class. Game has it's own class Identifies need to break out into further classes
Variables named thing, vvp, etc

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I found the group projects incredibly rewarding. First, having a partner to rely on in the unavoidable event you get stuck helps from a stress standpoint. Second, most people have different strengths and weaknesses and this creates the perfect opportunity to learn from one another. Case in point, Megan taught me a lot about TDD during the Black Thursday project.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kolyaventuri/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

###### Description:  
We built a Trie that was populated with a dictionary and the Trie allowed users to search for completed words using sub-strings.

###### Evaluation Comments:  

spec harness does not complete successfully
don't include our spec harness in your project, it can mess up our testing
select/insert/delete methods are too long and should be split up
Node initializer should default word to false instead of nil so refute will work better
CompleteMe only had 89% coverage (code in select and delete wasn't covered)
Untested methods:
CompleteMe.get_suggestions
CompleteMe.get_weights

###### Evaluation Scores:  
Ruby Syntax & Style: 3  
Breaking Logic into Components: 2  
Test-Driven Development: 2  
Functionality: 4  

###### Partner Feedback:  
Thank you so much for your hard work on the CompleteMe project! The fact that even if you're unsure about something that needs to happen you'll still jump in and ask questions and gain an understanding of a new concept or to reinforce a familiar concept is fantastic. As well, thank you for not being afraid to stop me when I just do something and lose you. It's vital we are on the same page so we all know what's going on, and not jumping ahead and diving head first into an idea I have without explaining it and discussing it first is something I can definitely improve. So thank you for slowing me down. During the project, I feel as though we could have been better about communication outside of Turing. When a feature was getting implemented, a branch being created, and just overall committing more often so we both know where each other are. Perhaps the other knows how to solve a problem one is stuck on! Overall, the work you put in was fantastic. Including all the time we spent discussing the best way to implement the select method, with the pros and cons of each tactic. I sincerely appreciate your dedication to the project.

#### Black Thursday

## D: Professional Skills
While I enjoyed the Gear Up sessions, particularly the opportunity to learn about others and techniques they use in various situations(stress management, staying positive), I did not feel that I gained an incredible amount from them. Most of the content seemed like a refresher from my time in business school.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I have always had a growth mindset but wasn't aware of what it was actually called, it is nice to now know how to talk about it with others. I am a firm believer that every problem has a solution, and that we should strive to find it. One of my favorite quotes is, "If you think it is impossible, then it is... for you." I feel it demonstrates the spirit of growth mindset perfectly.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

My main take away from this gear up was the importance of getting things from 'can do with effort' to 'mastered'. I have had a propensity in the past for picking something up quickly, getting to a strong proficiency, and then moving forward. Inevitably down the line the difference between strong proficiency and mastery shows, compiles, and causes significant issues.

#### Managing Stress
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

I've always managed stress well. However, by participating in this session I was able to gain a better understanding of how I relieve stress (turns out hand washing dishes is a meditation for me!), and actually a better understanding of my wife's anxiety by talking to some people about their stress/reactions. I also found that a majority of my stress comes from not properly allocating my time, so I am learning to schedule better.

#### Personal Story
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

By running through the personal story session I was able to garner a better understanding of what actually led me to Turing and where I am in my life right now. And, while sharing professional history and stories in interviews has never been an issue, it did bring to my attention that I should do a better job of weaving in parts of my personal history in order to give a better picture of who I am as professional.

#### Working Styles
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I did not feel that I learned very much about myself from this session, but it did shed an enormous amount of light on my more introverted counterparts. Particularly with respect to the preconception I had about how introverted people don't want me to engaged with them versus the truth that they just prefer different settings/styles to engage in. I also felt it was an opportunity to share that, for me, presenting an idea does not mean I am closed to critiquing/changing that idea.

#### Mod 4 Led - Ethics in AI

I was unable to attend this session. However, Ethics in AI is an issue I have previously spent sometime considering. It seems inevitable that there will be an uptick in cyber theft as AI allows controllers to more easily decrypt older, less secure data and there is a serious issue regarding an AI that is able to present itself as human, thus perpetuating the already existing cyber scam/phishing techniques that people use on a larger scale. The more pressing issue, at least in my opinion, is the displacement of huge swaths of the workforce as AI allows even more jobs to be automated. I believe it __should__ be the responsibility of those implementing the AI to account for this and create a solution, though I imagine it __will__ be governments that are ultimately burdened with the responsibility of solving this problem. I see no future where we stop the widespread implementation of AI, and personally I don't think preventing it would be the right decision, I can only hope that as a culture we get to a point where we can take advantage of the tool without taking advantage of each other.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Made myself available and was always happy to help classmates if the opportunity arose. Even in the instance where I might not know the solution I would work with the person so that we could try to achieve the goal together. Encouraged my module colleagues to get together outside of Turing hours in order to discuss coding issues and grow more familiar with one another.
