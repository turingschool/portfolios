# (Nikhil Shahi) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Being a repeater in M1, it was my intent to not make the same mistakes I had made the first time around (viz. few meetings with mentors, not enough practice of class methods in pry, not covering all the ruby and enum exercises etc.). I also made it a point to join the 'Echo' group to challenge myself and step outside my comfort zone and aimed to complete all the extensions for a given project. I knew it would be hard, but in doing so, I ended up learning a lot more than I expected and was able to understand basic concepts better. Turing emphasis having a 'Growth Mindset' and I feel I was able to have one which has aided me in having a strong foundation.

You are a junior developer at Netflix. You're on a team that is developing a list of movies for Netflix users called "Suggested for You." Each time movies are added to Netflix, an algorithm determines a score of how likely a given user is to enjoy that movie.

Scores are integers between 0 and 100
No two movies will get the same score
It is your job to take new movies that have been scored, and store them in a Binary Search Tree.

(feedback to me from Sabrina)

I appreciate that you were always on time, and you were considerate of my time when you asked when I needed to stop for the day. I liked that you involved you mentor on slack and GitHub and that you took the time to help me understand the code when I was struggling. Looking back, I would have liked to equalized the workload a bit more such as switching computers every thirty minutes. I got nervous when you pulled an all-nighter on Saturday and Sunday to update our code to make sure we were following the rubric, and that you coded all day on Sunday. I feel like I contributed ideas on Sunday, but I don’t feel like I helped with the workload because we were updating the code on your computer all day. I don’t feel like it’s fair to have to put all that pressure on you, and I want to make sure I’m learning by coding as well. I realize our knowledge of the material is greatly diverse, and I appreciate that we could have that open communication when I didn’t understand certain pieces of the code. I can tell that you really cared about my understanding of this project, and took the time to understand the rubric to make sure we followed the guidelines. All in all, I really enjoyed being your partner on this project, and I hope to get the opportunity again in the future.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

A business is only as smart as its data. In this project, Jake and I build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business. Through the principles of TDD, SRP and by communicating with each other in an effective manner, we were able to complete this project with 100% test coverage while meeting all the requirements of the spec harness.

## D: Professional Skills

In Module One, career development is focused on strategies to help students be successful at Turing. The following are key components of this success:

Cultivate Self-Awareness
Understand one's key strengths
Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
Ownership over one's learning
Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
Express one's own story and strengths
Manage stress effectively

### Gear Up

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This was an interesting session for me. For the longest time I put off learning or attempting difficult or even new things due to the perception of not being able to succeed. However, over time, I have learnt that one just needs to have a growth mindset and be open to the idea of learning to really get better at difficult things. There will be times of despair and frustration, but if I am able to manage my emotional well being and give myself the opportunity to get better at that 'thing', I will succeed. Turing is a good recent example - there have been days when I have questioned my presence here at Turing due to not being able to understand certain concepts, but through a lot of practice and working with teachers/ mentors, I began to understand the very concepts that seemed alien to me. There is an adage that Nothing is impossible - even the word 'impossible' spells I-(a)m-possible. That is pretty much my mantra now.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This was an important session in my opinion. Having worked in multiple industries and with all kinds of people, I realize the value of diversity - diversity of opinion, knowledge and experience. However, diversity brings with it some responsibilities as it important to understand that different people have different working styles and that my own working style might be different from someone else's style. I think it is important to build this self-awareness which in turn will help develop empathy with others and help us understand how to leverage different working styles for success in the workplace (or in life and beyond).

#### (Personal Stories & Connection)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I really enjoyed this session as it helped me understand my peers better and their own personal struggles. Everyone had interesting backgrounds and it was eye opening to hear of some of the issues they faced in their lives. It was great to relate to some of the stories and I felt closer to the story teller due to the similarity in our backgrounds. I left the session having a new appreciation of my fellow students which will help me tailor my working style to suit their personality.

#### (Mod 4 Leads - Learn through teaching)

* [GitHub URL] N/A

This was a really good session led by Marshall Houston, Adrian Lara, Hugh Hartigan and Thomas. I came to realize that the best way to learn is to actually teach someone else. That's how one can understand how much one really knows. Apart from self-awareness, it also brings a sense of fulfillment to impart your knowledge to someone else and in the process, empower them.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

One of the great things about Turing has been the plethora of mentors and peers that have been so willing to help me out with my understanding of the subject matter. The teachers themselves, like Ian, Brian and Mike have always been available, sometimes at crazy odd hours, to answer questions and help me understand concepts. Keeping that in mind and wanting to pay it forward, I spent a good chunk of my time this mod, helping others with their issues. I tried to spend between 6 to 8 hours a week with my peers to help them with any concepts that might be eluding them. It is my intent to keep doing this going forward - to this effect, I have already reached out to the 1803 BE students and have offered my assistance. A couple of them have already reached out to me and I am helping them understand expectations while guiding them to better prepare themselves for Turing. Case in point - one of the prospects wanted a slack video call (and screenshare) to understand what he could do to prepare himself. I walked him through ruby docs (advising him that he will be well served in playing with those methods in IRB or pry). I look forward to helping incoming students and helping them succeed the way I have been helped in the past.
