# Alex Cutschall - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I wanted to learn and soak up as much as I could and learn to write code
with a really solid foundation that theoretically could be built on with
minimal effort.

I have learned an incredible amount throughout this module. When Mike was
talking about what these portfolios purpose was, he mentioned that we were
to look back and truly see how far we've come and that's been incredible
clear to me. Looking back at my scores and evaluations and what they were
giving me feedback on.

  Feedback for Me:

## D: Professional Skills
Primarily, I feel like I understand how I work within a development team more fully.
How my skills and personality fit within a greater whole and how I can leverage those
for a more successful team overall.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Health and Wellness)

  This session on stress management was extremely helpful. It hammered home the growth mindset along
  with how to take care of ourselves. I enjoyed this and have continued thinking about these tips and
  trying to actively perform them.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Working Styles)

  This session was about introverts, extroverts, and ambiverts. I found it interesting how different the
  learning styles between them were and how to work with people who fell along the spectrum. It also helps
  knowing how I'm most comfortable working with people and to communicate that in DTR's;.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

  The video and article at the beginning of this video were very insightful. We then talked to different
  people on how we could implement these at Turing and that helped hammer home some actionable tips. Turing
  is incredibly difficult and to see how other people have talked learning a difficult subject was a great
  learning experience.

  ### Gear Up
  #### (Learning Through Teaching)

  The Mod 4 students were really insightful in how the techniques of teaching and being a student transfer
  over to being a mentor and mentee. I've struggled with this and hearing different techniques is extremely
  helpful.

## E: Community Participation

  ### Playing a Part

  How do you contribute?:
  I am a member of SAB, have gone to posses, helped other people with their projects, and participating in all
  of the school activities.
