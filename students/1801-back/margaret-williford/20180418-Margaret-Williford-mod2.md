# Margaret Williford - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
 I want to engage more with Turing community this mod. I want to be available as a resource to mod1 and also want to start going to meetups to start my job hunt. I want to stay on top of daily lesson plans and always be looking a day or two ahead. I want to improve my git workflow.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
   I still am not as strong as I'd like to be in Active Record and SQL. I can generally figure out any problem with enough googling but I want to go into mod 3 quicker on this. Looking ahead to mod3 pre-work it seems like there is plenty of practice on this. Also project management with a large group was a learning experience. Having an extremely detailed project tracker helps!

I wrote an intro to hashes for new ruby programmers.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I loved working on rails mini! It was interesting to be able to be more self directed. I think Bike Share was my least favorite only because of the difficulty of dividing up the work. Everything was so connected it was hard to avoid merge conflicts. It was a good intro to what the real world will be like so better to figure it out now!

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I had to do some basic API implementation. It was confusing, but then simple once I got all the syntax and conventions. I'm hoping this will be a bit of a leg up for mod 3. I also learned that it is harder to motivate myself to do TDD when there is no eval... I need to be sure I do that.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I've grown to love Pivotal Tracker! It's fun pairing with two people, especially switching back and forth between css and logic.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
So honestly, the empathy session for both favorite and least favorite. I thought this was a well-intentioned session. It is important to consider our empathy and privilege in tech. I think we need to be having more of these conversations as a group. It was a little uncomfortable that our small group conversation quickly turned to a conversation around me as a woman in the industry. I wish we had had time to debrief together after that session. I think this is something Turing needs to continue to push/emphasize and have more conversations around. The majority of people who repeat mod 1 are women or minorities - how are we addressing that? It was my least favorite only in that it didn't feel productive. I don't think anyone's opinions changed as a result of this session. We missed a session on gender and tech due to a snow day in mod1, and I want to ask Allison to add that to our calendar for mod3.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I've loved pairing with Mod1! I really want them all to succeed, especially those who are repeating and I've tried to make myself as available as possible. It is great learning for me too - especially when someone is approaching a problem differently than I had and we work through it together. Also it's just awesome to see stuff click for people.
Other than pairing, I joined SAB and have felt more connected to the Turing community than I did last mod. I'm trying to meet more people in other mods.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I want to get more involved with Joan Clarke. I always love going when I make the time, and it would be great to meet more women alumni.
