## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I took the time to dive into Python/Django in both quantified self and my personal project and I feel like I have a decent understanding of it. Comfortable enough to put on a resume! I rushed to get anything out the door for Quantified Self, but my personal project allowed for more time to dive into testing and conventions. I feel comfortable navigating Django's ORM. I can build management commands (like rake tasks) to seed a database. I created Services, and should probably break my capstone into more services. I successfully integrated Plotly, a data visualization package for Python and want to play around with this more. Integrating AJAX requests with jquery was a great learning point here as well. 

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Juggling the job hunt with the work load. I have been pretty aggressive in my search, applying and interviewing to a few places each week. I am motivated to find something ASAP, but I learned I really need sleep to be my best self too. I wasn't submitting my best work at Turing when I was distracted by cover letters, networking, and code challenges. During the last two weeks, I've scaled back my job hunt efforts to be able to devote more time to my capstone. Ultimately - I want something I'm proud of in my portfolio, so capstone in essence was part of the job hunt prep too. I am eager to find something, and I've had to stay organized with jobtrack.io to keep track of all my connections and applications. 

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I've made pairing with lower mods a big priority. I try to pair at least 2-3 times a week. I have a mentee in mod1 and have enjoyed working with mod2 and mod3 students too. I think it is what I have enjoyed most about my time at Turing. I've been mostly pairing with other women. It's my mission to make sure other women succeed here. JCS has been great for making those connections. This also has always been great for keeping my skills fresh. I have not written much Rails since week 1 of mod4 and walking through Mod3's API assessment, Rails Mini with Mod2, and Reunion with Mod1 has provided me with built in review time. I'm keeping up a few pairing relationships once I graduate so I'll still be around! You can't get rid of me.   

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I really didn't believe people that you could take a job in any language until this inning. Working on the Express app in week 2 made javascript less scary. I actually hadn't much experience with JQuery until my capstone. I would not have believed myself if 2 months ago someone told me I'd be making fetch requests between a python backend and a javascript front end. It was a big confidence boost to realize that I am able to pick up other languages. Now that I have a better grasp on JavaScript I'm starting to like it more. I never expected to be interested in more full stack positions, but I'm now targeting roles that will expose me to the front end. I think eventually I may make the switch to completely front end roles. 

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job

Reading documentation! I really enjoy pairing and my instinct is to usually phone-a-friend when I run into something, but I can't be that nag at a new job. Mod 3 and Mod 4 exploring new languages has really enhanced my ability to read documentation. Knowing how to read the docs themselves as opposed to stack overflow is a good skill. Turing has prepared me to receive a spec that I have no idea how to approach, and find a way to solve it. I have also come to really value convention. It can be tempting to just 'make it work' on a tough problem, but I think it is important to go back to write a more readable solution.
