# Jerrel Mitchell - M1 Portfolio
______________________________________

## Areas of Emphasis

> I wanted to learn and get comfortable with the basics of reading, writing, testing, and refactoring Ruby. To be able to feel comfortable with communicating with students, mentors, and instructors.

# A: End of Module Assessment

> Despite failing the assessment, I was proud that I got as far as I did with the information I recalled from the completion level of previous projects. I had never worked with a CSV class or file before and that was one of the more difficult parts for me, and trying to work around the GitHub problems I experienced was a bit flustering. With my current knowledge, I wouldn't change anything about what I did if I had a chance to do it again.

# B: Individual Work & Projects

> I felt very behind for each assigned individual project, but, overall it was good to understand my limits and take them to new heights when I would overcome an obstacle. For the obstacles I couldn't overcome alone, it was nice to be able to work with someone to help solve my problems by shaping concepts into questions into answers.

# C: Group Work & Projects

> Taking my limited experience with individual projects here at Turing, I was excited to be able to help others help themselves learn. While the projects were not fully successful in implementation, they were great for initiating collaborative effort.

## Enigma
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/JerrelMitchell/enigma_project)

Partner Feedback

> Firstly our DTR rocked and your determination is amazing! If you didnâ€™t understand how to approach something you researched the bigger picture and helpful approaches to the problem. I believe we both got tunnel vision at times and I feel like implementing a struggle plan would be wise. Possibly setting a clock/timer, if stuck on the same thing for 25 min seek help from a peer or mentor, if you go back after pairing and are still stuck for another 15 min then seek the next level of help, mentor or instructor. I enjoyed working with you and felt like we both learned a lot despite the difficulty we felt with the project. I am glad I had a partner I was able to easily communicate with and empathize with during the struggle.

# D: Professional Skills

> I fully grasp concepts and implementation of professionalism in the workplace, and leave detailed notes for git and DTRs. With a strong sense of empathy, I help others struggling on projects and work to apply growth mindset in all interactions.

## Gear Up

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from each session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

### Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

> The instruction and importance set for this session has greatly shifted the day to day interactions with myself and others. Influencing myself and others in a positive way that helps and supports rather than judge and exclude is great for a community like Turing. I have practiced this a lot even before Turing.

### Turing Citizenship #2: Cohort Vision & Getting Better at Difficult Things
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown)
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

> Brought to attention the values of students, mentors, and instructors working together to help with your success at Turing, everyone having their own struggles and the knowledge they gained through it by asking for help. I am still working on this aspect.

### Turing Citizenship #3: Public Narrative, Working Styles: Intro, Extro, Ambiverts!, Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)

> Gave a lot of insight into how individuals cope with other individuals and how those differences can be great in building a team that supports one another's weaknesses with the others strengths. Helped me with my understanding of myself as well in a team environment.

### Turing Citizenship #4: Retrospective, Personal Stories & Connection
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_retrospective.markdown)
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

> Was great to be able to understand where I have come from and where I am headed and put that into a story to tell others. Enjoyed a great group talk learning about others and where they are headed in their lives. I will continue trying to develop the story of myself to tell to others.

### Debugging the Gender Gap & Micro-aggressions in Tech
[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

> Was unable to attend.

# E: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

> Collaborated with upper mod students in posse meetings to learn other computer skills, as well as with peers in my cohort to create a support system that helps with stress management and practicing 'rubber ducking' for projects. Attended code fairs to see what upper mods were working on and spoke with them about their own struggles with their projects.
