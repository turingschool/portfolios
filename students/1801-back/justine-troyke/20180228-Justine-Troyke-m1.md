# (Justine Troyke) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to become proficient in knowing basic Ruby code and understanding the basic principles of coding.

## Rubric Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

I didn't pass the end of module assessment but did better than was expected as I was already aware that my abilities were not proficient enough to progress into module 2.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I have included several individual projects that I worked on through the course of Module one.

#### (A Perilous Journey)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/justinetroyke/perilous_journey)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/perilous_journey)

Description: In this project weâ€™re going to build a wagon train heading West over the treacherous Rocky Mountains. The emphasis of this project was working with linked lists and finding data.

Evaluation comments:
  - 13 tests
  - Completed through mid I3
  - Prepend didnt work
  - Avoid using an instance variable to use count - iterate through to count he items

Evaluation scores:
1. Ruby Syntax & Style
Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation

Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately

Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)

Ruby methods used are logical and readable

Code is indented properly

Code does not exceed 80 characters per line

Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

3: Meets expectations

2. Breaking Logic into Components
Code is effectively broken into methods & classes

Developer writes methods less than 10 lines

No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

3: Meets expectations

3. Test-Driven Development
Each method is tested

Tests implement Ruby syntax & style

3: Meets expectations

4. Functionality
Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

1: Well-below expectations


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Below are the projects that I worked on with a partner or in a group throughout module one.

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JerrelMitchell/enigma_project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Description: You are to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages. Additionally, your program will need to read messages from and output them to the file system.

Evaluation comments: N/A

Evaluation scores: N/A

Feedback to me: "It was great getting to pair with Justine from the beginning as she was very kind, and as far as I knew we understood one another and got a good head start on starting to draft out the project. I felt a positive connection that allowed honest communication throughout the week of the project.

I feel that if we had gone through the spec more thoroughly and asked questions in the planning phase we may have saved a lot of time and frustration as the due date came closer for the project.

Overall it was a great learning experience for future paired exercises and/or projects to be able to recognize other peoples methods for solving difficult problems, and that communication plays a big part in staying sane!"

## D: Professional Skills

In addition to our lessons and coding projects there were professional development sessions that I attended. In module one we were given strategies and tools on topics such as self-awareness, recognizing personal strengths or areas of improvement and working in a professional setting with partners.

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

My biggest takeaway from this session was that you need to be mindful of the language you use with yourself. Throughout module one I practiced qualifying my lack of understanding with present tense terms for example: "I don't understand this right now" or "This is hard right now". Making sure to set my mind up for the opportunity to grow, learn and evolve. Staying positive and continually effort are key.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This session taught me the value of keeping yourself emotionally healthy. Being patient with yourself as you struggle to understand something new and not being too hard on yourself as that can close your mind to absorbing the very thing you are attempting. A particular statement within this session stuck with me, it stated, "Feelings come and go" which made me more aware of letting the feeling happen and then pass so that you aren't stuck in a mood or mindset.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This session really enlightened me to the possibility of an ambivert and made me realize that I had falsely identified as an extrovert. More importantly I found that hearing from introverts themselves on how they would like to interact with all types of people was extremely valuable. I was immediately partnered with an extreme introvert after this and successfully put several suggestions into practice right away. Primarily making sure to be proactive about checking in on how my partner is doing and that I am don't control the conversation.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was struggling more than most towards the first half of the module and felt like I had immense help from the Turing student community. At first, I felt as though I wouldn't be able to offer much in the way of contributing to others struggling but quickly realized that other students in my class had difficulty with the same things I had struggled with or covered with a mentor and I was able to more firmly establish my own understanding by sharing what I had learned. I also found that I was able to champion a few classmates with positive encouragement and empathy which I feel was a more valuable contribution than trying to help with coding.
