# Clee Pollock - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came in with the expectation that I would be able to solve more advanced problems fluently. I suppose that I have met this expectation to a degree, but not to the degree of which I had hoped. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I set out to use these projects as building blocks to learn TDD, DRY, SOLID and proper use of OOP.

#### Flash Cards

* [https://github.com/pollockcl/flash_cards]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards]

It was a good introduction to classes and OOP. The big take away was how files interact with one another.

Assessor: Ian Douglas Repo: https://github.com/pollockcl/flash_cards Notes:

told to avoid over-chaining things for simplicity
"just because you can doesn't mean you should"
card generator was overly complex

#### Date Night

#### HTTP Yeah, You Know Me

* [https://github.com/pollockcl/http_yeah_you_know_me]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me]

Built an HTTP server. It was neat, but testing was very difficult. Taught me quite a bit about siloing out classes and responsibility.

Notes:
PASS (3)
be careful of code duplication (DRY principle)
aim for 90% or higher code coverage
no branching at all, doh

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### CompleteMe

* [https://github.com/anon0mys/complete-me]
* [http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me]

First group project! Working with others was definitely the big take away.

Assessor: Ian Douglas

Repo: https://github.com/anon0mys/complete-me

Notes:

node word? method seems unnecessary since you're storing it as a true/false value
node.inspect only used for test, which is unnecessary code
calls like .is_a?(String) don't need parentheses
create_node could have been made simpler with Node.new(letter, length==1)
try to avoid returning mixed data types such as in find_node (returns a node pointer or a string), should return pointer or nil, let something lse report the error
6 of 14 methods in the main class aren't specifically unit tested (build_branch, create_node, case_desensitizer, suffix_builder, suggestion_sorter, prune, for example)

### Gear Up

Below are my gear up sessions.

#### Growth Mindset

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown]

The whole point of this was to basically stay positive in the way that you think about things. It's a good thought process to get into and definitely helps in terms of stress management. I think that it is good to take it in portion though, as sometimes thoughts that aren't as positive are really good for one's motivation.

#### Dealing With Differences(Introvert vs Extrovert)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown]

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
This session was all about getting along with other people and tailoring your behavior differently for someone who is introverted vs someone who is extroverted. Carry around a certain awareness of other folks' social capabilities as not to make them feel isolated from conversation or like their opinion isn't valuable. This is a good soft skill that I'll definitely carry with me throughout my career.


#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md]

This session focused on one person's methodology of learning. I didn't find this session particularly valuable because I don't think that individual learning can be generalized by this one school of thought. I think mastery comes through constant and consistent action, not necessarily through just breaking up a field into subfields and focusing on the subfields. 

#### Storytelling and Strengths Finder

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown]

I think the storytelling aspect of this session was great. It's good to think about how other people percieve your telling of a story based on it's structure and relatability. I still need to work on this because right now I think my story is pretty dry.

#### Ethics in AI

* No Link

This was rough. Ethics are such an abstract concept and it doesn't seem like any two people share the same opinion on how they should be executed. I think in general people don't understand how AI works so they fill in alot of the blanks with the worst case scenereo and start asking needless 'what if' questions. I think that much of this debate could be solved with thorough education just to make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of how things work.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I helped other students with their projects and some of the concepts. I also went to wrap ups and participated in various discussions about things like ethics and what 'art' really is.
