# Jimmy Nelson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * I set out to always try my hardest, and to learn everything I could about how to use web frameworks with the guidance of teachers and the advice and experiences of my peers. I feel like I was pretty successful and that my knowledge of how the internet works, how a client interacts with a website, how websites use databases and how they're able to control who can access the parts of their site that are stored in the database.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * I struggled most with figuring out the rarer uses of ActiveRecord and SQL. I think finding a good resource that allows you to experiment with SQL and pre-made databases would be very beneficial, but I haven't been able to find one that is really good and helpful.
  * As a result, I have gotten a lot better during this inning at reading official documentation to find the answers I'm looking for.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  * My favorite project was rails-mini. I liked having full control over every step of the project and truly having to own every single line of code.
  * I think my least favorite project was Little Shop, but this was only due to the steep learning curve of jumping right into web frameworks and interacting with the database without fully understanding the database. Of course, how else are you supposed to learn these things but through experience? But it was still painful.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  * During rails-mini I really cemented my understanding of how you can pass params through links and how you can use them in the rails controller to do fun things. There was a part of Job Tracker that required you to pass params through a link, but looking back at it now I realize that I didn't fully understand what was happening until after completing the rails mini project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  * I got good practice at working with teammates who have largely disparate working styles and temperaments. While I was already pretty good at this it was nice to see the skills translate to working through a large project in which I was personally invested.
  * I also learned good rebasing practices and am now finally comfortable with rebasing!

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  * My favorite Gear Up was the mod-4-led one on Tech in medicine. It was very illuminating to see all the ways that tech impacts medicine and all of need that medicine has for improved technology and ethical software developers. My least favorite was the group-think discussion. I think it would have been improved if we had had an opportunity to read the articles separately before starting the session.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  * I contributed to the Turing community by attending wrap ups and retro every week and giving honest and kind feedback to my peers in retro and during feedback sessions.
  * After they gave the lesson on how to make more coffee, I started making about one pot per day! :)

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  * Next module I would like to start attending meetups and spreading the word about Turing.
  * I would also like to capitalize on an future opportunities like the 'Go Code Colorado' opportunity that occurred this mod.
