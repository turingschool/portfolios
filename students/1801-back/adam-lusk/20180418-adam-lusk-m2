## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I wanted to gain a basic understanding of rails and reinforce my understanding of HTTP. I was successful, but could always be more successful. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with prioritizing enough time to complete things, but still got most things completed.  There was always more studying
that I wanted to do but didn't have the time for.  So I learned how to better prioritize my tasks. I have a white board at 
home and I list my tasks and number them by importance levels.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?  
My favorite project is hard to choose. I liked the rails mini project because I got to work by myself.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?  
I learned what the workload of even a small project is like.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?  
Mostly how to be a diplomatic communicator.  

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?  
I liked the mod 4 led Gear Up on digital privacy the best, because it's a topic that I would be dealing with directly if I work 
with databases in the future.  My least favorite GearUp was the one on groupthink because I disagreed with the premise that group
thinking always leads you to bad decisions.  

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?  
I was the mentor of a mod one student. I washed all the dishes a couple times.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to get over my fear of going to extra-curricular events.
