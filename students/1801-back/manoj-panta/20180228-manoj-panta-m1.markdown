Areas of emphasis

Having no experience of coding before coming to turing and and being assigned to a
project within a week was really hard for me so i did not do so well. I now, realize learning to code requires way more hard work and practice than i was doing. since I'm repeating mod1, i will be working really  hard to achieve my goal.

** A: End of module assessment :1
fail

** B: Individual Work & Projects

In mod1 i did following individual projects
1.flashcards
2.mastermind


FLASHCARDS
Github :https://github.com/manojpanta/flashcard

in this project we basically wrote a program that is gonna ask for the guess and if it matches to the original answer that card holds then the program will give us the feedback.

Evaluation comments:
i do not see any evaluation for my project on the website.


MASTERMIND
it is kind of similar to the flashcards but a little more fuctionality
Evaluation comments:

Evaluation comments

 Feedback from Sergio
 It was great to work on Enigma with you Manoj. I believe that we utilized our time wisely and that we followed the DTR as planned. I appreciate you participating even though you didn't feel comfortable with some aspects of the project at times. I appreciate you asking questions when something was unclear and your willingness to learn. Something to focus on for next time is to get familiar with GitHub flow I think this will help projects run smoothly. You asking questions when you don't understand something will certainly help you in future projects.

 Feedback from Tylor
 Thank you for your contributions on this project.  You added valuable insight while we were trying to work through the logical side of this project on the whiteboard and during our pseudo-coding sessions. A single recommendation that I could make is just trying to be more present while working on the project, there were times while we were trying to work on a specific part of the code and you were working on command-line query exercises. Other than that, thank you for being a good teammate.


** E: Community Participation
I like the way every staff members and students are always willing to help me anytime i ask for a help.Hopefully in coming future i will be able to help others .
