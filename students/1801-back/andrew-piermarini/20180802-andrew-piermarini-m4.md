###### 1801 Mod 4 Portfolio Reflection
**Andrew Piermarini**


###### Reflection:

**What was your biggest achievement of the module?**  

Without a question, the biggest achievement of the module was Scavengr, the capstone project that Evan and I completed. Creating a decoupled application that leveraged Python/Django, Token Authentication, Elasticsearch, Action Cable, React, and realtime location tracking felt like an ambitious project. To have reached our MVP and then some is enormously gratifying.

On top of all of that, working with a partner on a self-directed project that required a deep dive into a number of unfamiliar technologies was a new experience for me. It required a lot hands-on planning and pair programming, and this aspect--in addition to providing a great learning opportunity in and of itself--could not have gone better. Evan and I were able to work through each of the challenges we faced and ultimately develop an application we are not only proud of, but eager to build upon and refine after we leave Turing.  


 **What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?**  

The biggest struggle for me was the mid-module Javascript assessment. From that experience, I learned that I needed to research more into Javascript promises and callbacks, and how data is passed from function to function. I also learned that I need to time-box myself on tasks that I am completing under a time crunch. The format of the assessment, by virtue of the fact that it was an independent exercise, is different than what I will most likely encounter as professional developer. Still, on one iteration, I spent too much time trying to get things to work using a particular approach, when I could have been researching and implementing a different solution. I like to think that I would have reached out for advice/assistance early if I had encountered that same challenge in the context of a job. Nevertheless, this experience served to reinforce the idea that stepping away from a problem and considering a different approach can be tremendously valuable.  


**What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?**  

I feel incredibly fortunate to have gone through this program alongside the talented individuals in our cohort. I had mentioned above that I felt Evan and my capstone project was ambitious, but it was no more ambitious than the projects our peers built. If anything sets me apart from my peers, I suppose it was that Evan and I experimented with a different set of technologies (i.e. web sockets, realtime location tracking, elastic search) than others. In the end though, I am truly impressed and inspired by what everyone accomplished.  


**How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?**  

My experience working with some Javascript and building APIs for front-end components confirmed that, while I appreciate front-end, my interests align more with back-end software development. With that said, I gained a much better understanding for how important Javascript and JQuery are for building dynamic web applications and crafting more seamless user experiences. Although I will try to stay closer to the back-end of the stack, I hope to continue to leverage front-end technologies in the future and to, at a minimum, incorporate them into my own projects.

As for reframing what I learned in prior modules, module 4 has me feeling much more confident in building decoupled applications that use a number of languages and frameworks. I will walk away from this experience feeling far more equipped to make informed design decisions as to application architecture than I was before.


**What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?**  

In my time at Turing, I have developed a robust skillset as relates to languages and frameworks like Ruby/Rails, and programming more generally. However, I recognize that I have barely scratched the surface of software and web development. More particularly, the more I have learned, the more I have realized what little I know. The most important thing that I gained in my time at Turing, then, is a strong foundation upon which to further my understanding of software and web development, a process for tackling challenging projects and a confidence that, when faced with unfamiliar problems, I can work my way through them.
