## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

My goal was to participate in the code fair this inning and try to start making my building permit app a reality. At the time I also said...

>That would mean possibly researching how to build a spider and maybe location based libraries. Those are both pretty ambitious, so if nothing else, my goal is to keep up with module 2 and also do some independent research on ruby and geolocation."

I'm excited and surprised that I mostly accomplished my goals. Not only did I enter the code fair, I won the code fair. I researched geolocation libraries and made it the subject of my lightning talk. I didn't get very far in terms of web scraping, but I did find a tutorial that I might try to do this intermission.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn?**

I struggled most with overextending myself and not getting enough rest. From Little Shop, all the way through Bike Share, I didn't take very many breaks, and usually they were because I was just too exhausted to keep going. After Rails mini, I noticed I wasn't learning as much or feeling as on top of things, so I recalibrated a little bit and took more time off, but I still think that I need to find that balance between 'this is so cool, I want to work all night' and taking care of my mental health.

Technically speaking, I found Capybara convention to be frustrating, especially scoping, that's still a bit tough for me. I also struggled with authorization and authentication. In particular, both of these struggles have improved my debugging skills as I chase my errors through the terminal.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

They were all kind of my favorite and least favorite simultaneously.

Little Shop was immensely satifying because we got to use ActiveRecord and SQL for the first time, and I felt like I was good at that, which is amazing. But Little Shop was also the project where our team had a major last-minute workflow issue, which was a major kick in the pants.

Job Tracker was great because I felt like my git workflow improved a lot, thanks to Nikhil. But also, that was the project that took the most hours for me, and I think my time management could've been better.

Rails mini was so much fun and I love love loved normalizing real data into my database. But I also underemphasized auth, and I think that hurt me later.

Bike Share went incredibly smoothly, and that alone almost makes it my favorite, but I didn't get to do as much of the AR as I would've liked.

**What did you learn from your independent projects?** I didn't quite trust myself to pick a task that would be executable for rails mini, but I learned that I wasn't too far off the mark with my personal expectations.

Also, I learned it's possible to spend a lot of time down rabbit holes and how to pick and choose your battles in favor of delivering an MVP.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?** I learned that if you start separating tasks really early, you can make a lot of progress really quickly. My instinct is to do about a day or so of work together, so you can know your team is working with the same expectations, but I now think that's a bit too much.  

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up?**

There were a couple that were very cool I thought. I actually liked the Groupthink one a lot because I felt like I had a very real conversation with some front-end students about the differences in perceptions among the two programs.

The mod4 session on common ground was great, and actually, I think some of those points (how to talk about yourself) would fit really well in the networking Gear Up. The session leaders were warm and the group was very open, I appreciate stuff like that.

**Least favorite?**
All of them were pretty good, but I didn't like the networking one as much as the others. I know some of those skills already and I don't think the 10 minutes to craft your outreach was guided enough to be useful -- I barely got through my research, let alone an email draft.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

I was a part of the Health and Wellness posse, and helped to coordinate events.

I was also part of the mental wellness focus group, and enjoyed the opportunity to help shape the discussion around taking care of ourselves.

I paired with students early on in Mod2, but I probably only did about 3-4 sessions in total. I did check in from time to time with some M1 students to see how they were dealing with Turing life.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I plan to continue my participation in the H&W posse, hopefully helping to coordinate Friday retros. I'd really like to pair more in the upcoming module -- I think I know enough to be helpful to some students, but lately, I think I haven't been articulating it well.
