## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

My goal this module was to relax a bit more in my coding. After pushing myself really hard in modules 1 - 3, I was starting to feel anxious around coding generally, even though I enjoy it. So I decided it was important for me was to start to feel confident that I would solve the problem even if it seemed difficult in the moment. I didn't execute everything perfectly this mod, but normally I was pretty happy with what I did and that's great.

Technically speaking, my capstone is now the fufillment of a years-long vision that I had. I think the Hello Block data dashboard is fun to look at, and almost exactly what I was imagining when I pitched my project. I'm proud that it uses both PostGis and Mapbox. Both were libraries/extensions that I was interested in before mod 4, and both were the right tool for my project. I think that I'd like to use both in other projects in the future, and both lend themselves to other frameworks I'm interested in exploring like Django.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Related to my first goal, at some point during the first week, I couldn't get my Rails QS deployed to AWS and was so dissatified with my progress that I wanted to drop out of Turing for about 12 hours. I think I solved the problem later that same day. That was the point at which I decided the best thing that I could do this module was chill out and focus on enjoying the process.

Technically speaking, I think that the biggest struggle was the Javascript assessment. This experience was almost the inverse of deploying on AWS: I was extremely patient with myself and just certain that I was going to do a good enough job. I took each iteration piece by piece and focused on using strategies that I knew I could execute -- like using SQL to build my json. I felt like my understanding of using promises really crystallized at this point too, and that was possible because I could trust myself take some time and read tutorials and docs during the assessment.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I always try super hard. No matter if it's a project, a lightning talk, or a gear up, I will always engage with my task and try to make something cool.

I've remained engaged with the larger Turing community and worked with backend students in mods 1, 2 and 3.

I create distinctive projects that are based in a love for data and civic engagement.


## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I've mostly felt like front-end design was about being pixel perfect, and focused so much on aesthetics to the point it could undermine ideas. The example I think of is a memory from M2, when I sat in a FEM1 class on fonts that taught how a line of text shouldn't exceed a certain length. What if you need people to engage with not just one line, but a bunch of text because it's important?

My experience with Mapbox taught front end design isn't only about pixels, but about logic and digital feng shui. I gained more appreciation for the logical part when I needed to get data from one part of the app to inside my map. And I appreciated the design element when I wanted to convey so much in one map, but had to figure out what would say the most.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
I thought my last job was what allowed me to be interesting to other people. Turing has reminded me that ideas don't come from a job title, they come from enthusiasm.
