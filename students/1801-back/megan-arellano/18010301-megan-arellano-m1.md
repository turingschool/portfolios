# Megan Arellano - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At the very beginning of this module, I was mostly excited to spend time working on a skill (coding) that I'd been interested in for a while. I also hoped that I would be spending more time teaching myself cool Ruby tricks. By the second or third week, it became clear that keeping up with the curriculum would be challenging enough. So mostly, I've been aiming to pass.

For that reason, in weeks 2 and 3, I barely did any exercises in favor of project work. By week 4, a meeting with my mentor started to push me back towards exercises, and I began to feel reconnected with the neatness of programming.

And a lot of things really felt like they converged at the end of the mod for me. In addition to doing more exercises, we started working with CSV files and that's actually really exciting to me because of the data work that I used to do as a journalist. Projects like Black Thursday and Company Audit actually bear some resemblance to things I'd want to do to different data.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Kelly and I passed Black Thursday, I passed my paired assignment, and I passed my individual assessment.

My personal assessment of myself is that I can and should move into Mod2.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I think that my individual projects best showcase just how far I've come in my time at Turing. I started with no programming background and time management issues, and now I've moved to some programming and managing my time well enough to finish.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ssciolist/turing_flashcards_1801)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards)

This project introduced me to the importance of time management. I started late, and then expected that I wouldn't need to work over the weekend. When I started working on the weekend, I started to realize just how behind I was. I may revisit this one to practice how classes can interact.

Notes:
* 3 6 2 test files erroring out
* Some places using instance variables where locals would do
* Working through Iter 4
* Talked about some adjustments in naming and matching methods asked for in the spec
* One class file doesn't match file name Test files written with test_something.rb pattern

#### Perilous Journey

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ssciolist/perilous-journey)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/perilous_journey)

I remember feeling really excited to understand the concept of a linked list and explaining it to a lot of my peers. In retrospect, I still did not have a good grasp on managing my time, and this is one that I'm particularly disappointed to not have finished.

Notes:
* 18 tests, all passing
* Logically good
* Some methods a bit long
* Use predicate methods in the future to simplify complex conditionals
* Some opportunities to refactor for readability, SRP, and efficiency

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ssciolist/http-yeah-you-know-me-1801)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

The first project I finished! I prioritized functionality, and I would be interested to try and refactor this one. I think I felt prematurely proud on this one, and should have taken more time to add tests -- in other words, if I hadn't rested on my laurels, I could've gotten a proper 3.

Notes:
* Not testing full possibilities of game
* Two classes: Server and Game
* No Rakefile
* sending response to client should be broken out into separate method
* Response class is started. I like the way this is going. More functionality from Server should be refactored into Response
* Mixing Server functionality makes unit testing very difficult. For instance, word_search can't be unit tested because it responds to the client

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/janeywanee/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

I enjoy pair projects, and I particularly enjoy the challenge of meeting someone where they are and trying to match up. It's also extremely draining to me. In terms of the work, I felt comfortable with most of the concepts, but neglected to give proper attention to the runner files. Jane and I got to them on the evening before the project was due, and both wrote them off as simple tasks we didn't need to devote lots of time to.

Overall: 2
- Crack runner does not work
- Decrypt does not work
- Test coverage at 99.43%

Here's my feedback from Jane:

"First, I want to start out with saying how happy I was to have you as my partner for Enigma. Right from the beginning during our DTR we pretty much agreed with everything on how we wanted to work together. I knew we would clash well and be on the same page about mostly everything. You did really well with communication and keeping me up to date from  when it was dealing with the project or what time we were going to meet. One thing  that I really appreciate is when you would patiently walk me through a process I didnâ€™t quite understand.

I will have to say that we complimented each other well and literally worked hand in hand. There were times when I would be having trouble and you would be able to swoop in. Then there were times when we would be in too deep and taking too big of chunks and I would have to remind us to take a step back and refer back to the spec. Something I would recommend you do is take smaller steps, it will make things clear and less confusing. "

#### Black Thursday

Learned a lot from Kelly and had another great pair project. My favorite part was actually using enumerables and feeling like I understood what was happening.

## D: Professional Skills
Sometimes I look forward to these as something that I can do "right." My previous career pushed me to engage with people I wouldn't otherwise, and I enjoy social science.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
I still remind myself to practice good self talk all the time, that's definitely the biggest thing that I'm taking away from this session. One thing that I'm doing differently is seeking positive reinforcement more from people who aren't my immediate family or friends (in order to remind myself that yes, I can do this). Sometimes that works well for me because people at Turing know exactly how hard this stuff is, and other times it's kind of hard because they're a bit more honest.

#### Working Style
In this session, I enjoyed seeing that there were people more introverted than me. It really made the idea of ambiversion click in a way that it hadn't before. But most importantly, I have used this session to inform how I approach pair projects. Now, because I identify as a person who needs time away from other people, I make sure to take pomodoros where I'm walking by myself or up the stairs on my own.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
I remember really liking the Kathy Sierra talk, but I never implemented her A-B-C box method for learning things. For someone who's working on time management, that might be another good one to review.

As for Ta-Nehisi Coates, that guy is great. I always remember this one video he made for the Atlantic where he talked about becoming a writer... He said that there were always journalists who were better than him, but he kept trying for longer. I often think about that at Turing: I don't have to be the best, I just have to keep trying.

#### Personal story
This was the hardest one for me in the sense that I thought 'I don't *need* this, I'm already good at this.' But one thing that I gained from this session is that I had to change my story to reflect that I am student at Turing. I had been resistant to let go of my old identity as a journalist, and I need to start identifying as a developer. I'll continue to be thinking about that one. At least my LinkedIn is updated to reflect my new career path though.

#### Managing stress
After this session, I started to get more serious about eating in the evenings when I'm working at Turing to take better care of myself. Generally, I do an alright job taking care of myself, but I also need to be super attentive to my mental health. Another thing: I also started to notice the signs of stress in others a bit more easily because of this session. So I started trying to engage a bit more with peers who seem stressed by talking about things that aren't Turing.

#### Introvert to Influencer
What I liked best about this session was hearing about the other Turing students I hadn't met yet. I'd already seen the Amy Cuddy talk on power posing, but I've started to reintegrate it into my life. I spent 5 minutes power posing before my paired assessment and I'm trying to power pose as I wait for my project evaluation.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I may not be the strongest student in the cohort, but I am proud that when I get a piece of knowledge, I pass it on. Generally, that happens when I'm working at Turing in the evenings. Like during Perilous Journey, when I spent an extra 90 minutes helping my fellow students after a pairing station instead of going home -- I remember looking at my phone and being surprised that so much time had passed. As mentioned in a gear up reflection, I also try to talk to people about not-Turing stuff in an effort to give our minds a break.

Outside of my cohort, I have mostly benefitted from the Turing community, especially from Nora Gully, Maria St. Louis-Sanchez, Ellen Cornelius. But I have made some efforts to contribute to a larger conversation about public data vis a vi the new #data channel. Other than that, I have been friendly and engaging and tried to ask upper mods about their lives instead of just begging for help.
