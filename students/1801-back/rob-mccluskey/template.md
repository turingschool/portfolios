## B: Individual Work & Projects

Worked on Perilous Journey and Mastermind

#### Perilous Journey

Learn Linked Lists by recreating portions of the Oregon Trail game

X Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation X Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately X Naming follows convention (is idiomatic) X Ruby methods used are logical and readable
Code is indented properly X Code does not exceed 80 characters per line X Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
X Code is effectively broken into methods & classes X Developer writes methods less than 10 lines X No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP
X Each method is tested X Tests implement Ruby syntax & style

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Enigma

https://github.com/Vadlusk/enigma
http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma

Recreate the Enigma encoding machine, and the Turing machine that countered Enigma

decrypt.rb file io not working
Enigma.encrypt not working in pry
^working in tests
Only Enigma class
Tests error out in Rake
Tested different lengths of messages, nil, tested upper case
Lots of helper methods. Could have factored out into other classes

1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2
  2: Below expectations
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 2
  2: Below expectations
3. Test-Driven Development: 2

4. Git Workflow: 3

5. Functionality: 2
  2: Below expectations

The project went well overall. When one of us had a misunderstanding, the other was generally able to research the problem and figure it out. I appreciate how you reached out to multiple mentors for help.  That's not as easy for me to do.  I felt there were a couple times when communication could have been better, such as at the very beginning of the project when you created the first files without me or when you accidentally created a new branch. A heads up that these things were about to happen or have happened would have sped up progress.  I had an unexpected merge to deal with, and the initial set up and planning are the most important parts of the project and I was left out.  But overall, I appreciate the light-hearted attitude despite having a serious work ethic.

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown
Growth Mindset is about having an open and flexible mind.  There is no black and white, and everyone is different.  Accept others for who they are, don't judge.  Always be open to learning, never think you're done.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md
My pattern has become struggle for thirty minutes, then get help from classmates, upper mods, mentors, and finally instructors, in that order.  Overall did not find this very helpful.  Already emotionally doing what they recommend.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown
Very interesting, loved this one.  I find no one is fixed on the Introvert / Ambivert / Extrovert line, but move around depending on things like our mood, and where we are.  I find I am about 70% Introvert and 30% Extrovert, but I try to be more Extroverted.

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md
Nothing here was new to me.  I have been battling stress and depression for over thirty years.  This had no affect on me.

#### Personal Stories & Connection
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown
This seemed like some foundation for later on when we begin the job search aspect of Turing.  However, I found it overall not helpful for a student.  This would be better to save for Mod 4 when we need a story of who we are to tell prosepective emloyers.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Volunteered to help with a TryCoding Weekend
Helped classmates when able
Entered into conversation with students I did not know, just to be friendly
Pitched in with some heavy lifting with Arturo
Posse split up after first meeting, never joined a replacement
