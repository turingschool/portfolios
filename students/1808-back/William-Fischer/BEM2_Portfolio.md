## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I started this mod on the tail of some domestic troubles. My goal this mod was to succeed, but also give myself time to recover and to be with my significant other. It was hard finding balance. We struggled for many weeks, slept badly, ate badly. We still haven't started exercising again. But we have talked through a lot of our issues and things are going much more smoothly.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  Although I tried to keep my ego in check, I did very well in Mod 1, and I know I'm a talented programmer, so I brought some ego into this mod anyway, despite my best efforts. On top of my exhaustion, that feeling of pride primed me to take it personally when I received critical feedback, and I spent a couple weeks this mod frustrated over my performance evaluation results. I'm used to scoring high, and I crave affirmation, so when I'm ridiculed without affirmation to counterbalance, I tend to get a little grumpy. Originally, I told myself it was because of friction between me and Ian, which I felt early on. Now I think that if there was tension, it arose because I presented myself as contentious and show-boaty on the first day, even though I make an effort not to be.

  This experience forced me to confront some hard-to-swallow truths about myself, and I think I did confront it. That's not to say I've broken the pattern entirely, but I did become a lot more familiar with my own nature.

  All in all, this mod has been mostly about self-discovery, although I still learned plenty on the technical side of things.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was BookClub because I really enjoyed working with Bailey and building a solid collaborative workflow. My least favorite was LittleShop because I had a hard time putting in as much effort as it deserved because I was overwhelmed with personal stuff.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
In the last independent project, I learned a lot about how to use TDD to pivot if you need to apply a structural overhaul to your code.

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
Similar to last mod, I contributed less than I wanted to. My contributions were mostly in the form of helping others get through annoying bugs, which is my strong suit.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next module, I'd like to take better care of myself and segment focused work time so I'm mentally and emotionally available to work with others the rest of the time. I think the best thing I can offer are debugs and simple explanations of complex topics

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?
I was a member of the run-club posse, but I was only active for a couple weeks.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
I like spending some time outside with friends doing something healthy. It's connecting and rewarding.

How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?
Not yet, but I think it will if I'm more consistent about it.
