## Areas of Emphasis

##### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to build a strong foundation with the ruby programming language, and begin expanding my skillset around professional development. More importantly, I challenged and prepared myself to keep going even when the initial excitement faded out, when things got hard or frustrating, and when other shiny things began to compete for my attention. My goal was to stay focused even when it wasn't easy or convenient, and I did succeed.

##### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Telling my story has always been hard for me. Even when I clearly had the ability and the credentials, I've always struggled to talk about my skills or experience without downplaying them or degrading myself. I struggled because I fundamentally believed that I wasn't qualified, or rather, that I wasn't good enough. Telling my story in the wake of clear successes, and in the context of something I love and am cut out for has helped me to begin repairing a damaged self-esteem.

## Projects

##### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
CompleteMe was my favorite project because it's such a clear example of how a clever application of a common data structure can create useful functionality. Black Thursday was my least favorite project because the specs didn't quite reflect the expectations, and it took a lot of time to test guesses about what the spec harness was measuring.

##### What did you learn from your independent projects?
The independent projects allowed me to practice good mechanics, master the coding environment, and experiment with different language elements and design styles. I also tend to rush when I do projects on my own, so it gave me a chance to make some significant mistakes and face them, which hurt, but teach long lasting lessons. For example, on future independent projects, I plan to do a DTR with myself, carefully gauging my mental and emotional state, my goals, and my plan of action, as well as carefully considering what I need to do to take care of myself, to get back on track if I slip, and what allowances I might need based on life circumstances. I'll also be careful to spend time in the design phase, even if the project seems easy, instead of jumping headlong into the code.

##### What did you learn from your paired projects?
Despite the trouble I have talking about myself, I also struggle to set aside my ego when I'm in a problem solving mode and I'm good at what I'm doing. I've programmed before, and I've solved problems at a similar level before, so most of the concepts this mod came easy to me. With more experience than others, it's natural to try to do all the work myself or micromanage others. Working in pairs helped me practice stepping aside and let others have the answers. It was relieving to learn that, even when I had a solution, theirs were often better. The knowledge that everyone has something immensely valuable to bring to the table was reinforced by the experience of seeing their value. That confidence in others lifts the burden of responsibility that can be overwhelming if you're not sure your team will show up or do a good job.

## Community

##### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
Throughout my education, I've always asked questions that are "beyond the scope," which might be annoying, but I believe they're also helpful. I'm intensely curious; I don't just wonder how it works, I wonder why it works that way, what are the exceptions, what are the uses, what are the strengths and weaknesses, who designed it and in what context, what other elements or systems does it interact with, and so on. When a new topic is introduced, instead of practicing what we were shown in class, I would dissect it, experiment with it, find its limits and its alternatives. I think that mindset is my biggest strength as a developer, but also as a learner, and throughout the mod, I made an effort to share it with others. I helped people by answering questions when they hit a wall, but I think I helped more by asking questions, and showing them something of how few limits there really are when it comes time to ask.

##### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next module, I'd like to make myself more available for my classmates. This mod, I spent a lot of time alone, which was helpful for me, but I'd like to find a balance next time around that's more focused on them. I think I have a knack for debugging and dissecting the full source of a problem, and it's helpful for others to see that in action.
