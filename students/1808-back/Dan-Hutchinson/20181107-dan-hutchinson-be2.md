# Dan Hutchinson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

	I set out to learn the basics of Rails, ActiveRecord, and SQL. I believe I was successful in this regard and feel competent in my abilities with each. I also intended to continue strengthening the bond between myself and my classmates, as well as between myself and the larger Turing and coding communities, and feel resoundingly successful in the former, and moderately successful, with regards to the latter. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

	ActiveRecord is still not my strongest suit, but I have certainly come a long way. I also struggled with the volume of concurrent work/assignments and the stress of having so many obligations, but feel that through time management and focus I was able to work through this. I learned the power of my own time- and stress- management techniques and found a new confidence in my ability to juggle multiple assignments at once.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I really enjoyed our first group project and working with a team on this one (Little Shop). I also loved getting to work with Cesar (Book Club). My least favorite was probably Laugh Tracks as I had to write all the styling myself and did not enjoy that! 

What did you learn from your independent projects?

That I can rely on my own abilities as a programmer and can work/reason my way through difficult requirements by breaking them out into more manageable chunks. 

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

How better to navigate interpersonal and group dynamics in a work setting. I learned how to manage my own expectations and rise to meet those of others. I also learned how much I like coding with a team! 


## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I have tried to be a positive and outgoing presence in our class. I like to think I have encouraged and supported my classmates and that I have had a positive impact on those around me here at Turing, more generally. 


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I hope to continue building a relationship of trust,confidence, and camaraderie amongst our class. I have grown very close to those around me and want so sincerely for us to all succeed together.
