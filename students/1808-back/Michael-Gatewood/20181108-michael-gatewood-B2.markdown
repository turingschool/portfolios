# M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

    Being quite comfortable with vanilla Ruby, I was excited to learn about Rails and SQL.  I didn't really have an idea of what ActiveRecord was or its purpose.  But having having used SQL in the past for basic queries in MS Access, I was excited to dive deeper.  Being a fronty-grad, I was also excited to have some visual projects to add to my portfolio.

    Overall, Mod 2 was a success.  I was really hoping to have a better grasp on SQL and ActiveRecord, but not being able to attempt the stats requirements from the Little Shop project hurt my growth a bit.  This is something I will give additional attention over the intermission.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

    I struggled mostly (almost exclusively) with ActiveRecord.  Throw in a little bad luck with group project partners and you have a student who is starting to feel the wear of 6 mods at Turing.  I learned I need to spend more time practicing ActiveRecord, I need a little bit of a break, and I need to be a little more attentive to my mental health going into Mod 3.

Summary (1-3 sentences):

    My blog post is an introduction to Git Aliases for new developers, in the context of my own experiences.  My position is that there are very little gains to be had by aliases when used with the simple Git workflow of a student/junior dev.  However, I've gotten the most returns out of aliases when using it as a repository for the more complex Git commands that I use infrequently.  I use 'git aliases' to quickly recall the commands that I have saved, but don't use often enough to remember the alias name.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

    Yes.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

    My favorite project is probably Book Club because I feel that I learned more through this project than I did with others.  I probably pushed twice as much code for Little Shop, but a lot of that code was repetition (also very valuable).

What did you learn from your independent projects?

    I learned (see: reinforced prior knowledge) that I am GREAT at cranking out code when working alone and free from distractions.  It has become clear that my 'niche' skill is to identify and execute the next task (one single line of code at a time) to be completed in order to progress in a project; without being overwhelmed/distracted by the perceived enormity of scope.  When something absolutely must be completed in order to proceed with the project, I have been the one to get it done.

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

    I learned that I am a GOOD partner, but I am GREAT at cranking out code when working alone and free from distractions.
    
## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

    I am an asset to my classmates, particularly my project partners.  I'm always happy to coach others in solving problems and I have a skill set in CSS and front-end design that is unique in the back-end program. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

    Much like I was a resource for UI/design in Mod 2, I hope to be helpful as the class learns the quirks of JavaScript.
