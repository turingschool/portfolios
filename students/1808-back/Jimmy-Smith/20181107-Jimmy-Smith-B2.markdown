What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
What I struggled with most this module was cementing certain concepts. I felt that I was drowning in the
vast amounts of information that we were taking in and wasn't quickly picking them up at the rate that I wanted. I learned that struggle is perfectly normal, just keep on trekking and not to psych myself out as much if I don't understand the concept at first glance. What we are learning is pretty advanced and will take time to understand.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord? 
It was extremely helpful, it essentially opened up my eyes and gave me familiarity with creating Active Record Queries, I still have much to practive but I felt that this project was the gateway to it.

## Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was the BookClub project, I was learning a lot coupled with an awesome partner.
Everything was brand new and I felt as if I was absorbing the material the more I went along with the project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
How difficult Active Record queries are, and how to implement. I learned that I need to take my time and ask for help and not to freeze when you are stuck on a problem.

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
That communication is key, and to not be shy to speak up, even if you think that you have a dumb question. And always have a project management tool for smooth sailing.

## Community
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
This module I felt as if I didn't contribute as much because I focused so much on getting my tasks done.
If anything the least I have done was provide help and support to those that needed it.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I hope over the break to really ramp up on my knowledge base and hope to contribute that knowledge to those that might not have it next module.
