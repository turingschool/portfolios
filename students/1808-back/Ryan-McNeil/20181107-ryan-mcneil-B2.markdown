# M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- Going into this module I was hoping to add a lot more tools to my tool belt, compared to Mod 1 where most of the topics were just enforcing what I already knew. I was very successful.  Although I wouldn't say I have a perfect understanding of SQL and ActiveRecord, and I can honestly say I'm happy with my understanding of the majority of the topics covered. I've become much better at testing, even in an environment where we have dozens or more files to navigate through.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- For the first time, I really struggled with the school life balance. I ran into some personal hurdles about half way through the mod, and without having the time to fully deal with it, the stress compounded.  I learned, most of all that I shouldn't let it get me down (I was certain I was going to fail the mod), and that I had it in me to persevere.

Summary (1-3 sentences):
- I chose to write about Faker Gem, and its ability to add efficiency and character to our development and test databases.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
- Definitely


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- I really enjoyed Little Shop as a group project.  Being able to pair, alternate partners, and put our brains together on interconnected parts of the project was fun. I didn't really have a least favorite as they all had benefits.  The final project was very time consuming on top of other requirements, so that was by far the most stressful.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I learned that I could take things I learned from my partners in Little Shop and implemented them in what I believe to be even more efficient ways.  I also learned I had it in me to solve some of the tougher problems!

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
- I learned that GITHUB is terrible, and our best friend.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I started the #runtime posse! I also was able to attend the NASA hackathon, which was a great way to get to know a bunch of people in other mods.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I'd like to get more involved in other hackathons/meetups

### Member of a Posse
