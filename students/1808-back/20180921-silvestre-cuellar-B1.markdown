## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I really wanted to dominate my independent challenges and paired Assessments.
I think that overall I did a good job. I still feel that I need to find out better
ways of refactoring and making the code look better, but overall I feel that I got
over iteration 3 and finished 4 90% of the time.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think that I struggled the most with partnered projects this mode. I feel that
I need to do better and explaining things or communicating my thoughts directly and
not beating around the bush.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I really liked Battleship and Black Thursday. I did not get as far as i would've liked on
Battleship due to some circumstances but I feel like these two projects prepared me the
most and actually challenged me to learn more and tackle the problems from different
perspectives.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I think that i learned to appreciate working alone. I learned that I have a particular
way of writing code. Compared to last time, I actually learned less from the independent
projects versus the paired.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I found paired projects to be very challenging, but at the same time as
mentioned above I did learn more. This time around I felt that I had to explain
my thought process more and understand other thought processes. Therefore I learned
to teach some things and gained other perspectives.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I felt that as an iterator I helped some people adapt to the Turing pace,
as well as helped out with making feel everyone more welcome. I was not as social
as last time around  but I still feel that I contributed my share

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I want to be as inclusive as I was the first mod, I feel that I did not bond with
as much as I would've liked. The goal is to talk to the people i have not really talked
to as much.
