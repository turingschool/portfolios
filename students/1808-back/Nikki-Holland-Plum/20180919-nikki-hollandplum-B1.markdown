## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to be ahead of each project and assignment, I was intent on pairing and meeting with instructors as much as possible. I also set out to be helpful to the incoming students since I was repeating.

I was very successful this mod in what I set out to accomplish. I felt as though I learned and grew a lot. I laser focused on material that was difficult for me before, those were my strongest areas this time.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

At points I struggled with managing my life-life with my turing-life. I learned that it is okay to ask for help and began meeting with the therapist when I needed.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project this module was Black Thursday. I really enjoyed making a functioning database-like structure and working well with a partner.

My least favorite project was Battleship. I let myself get caught up on little things that held up my overall progress. I still got a lot out of it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that I was capable of doing things that I did not think I was and I learned how to implement different lessons into my projects in real time.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned how to communicated differently with different people about code. I learned how to explain my thought process and how to dissect someone else's thoughts.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I tried my best to offer help to other students, especially at the beginning of the mod. I offered to work with students via slack screen share and I held standing ruby exercise time in the mornings.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to continue to help my other students as well as the incoming 1810 students. I would like to particiate more in the Health and Wellness posse and teach yoga.
