Tim's M2 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis
What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I was hoping to take my Ruby knowledge from mod 1 and learn how to implement it in the real world. I feel like I still need some more practice on creating apps from the ground up but I think I've learned the basics of it.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with getting projects started. Learning where to start and what to plan out and what to just jump in and start coding. The agile approach helped solve some of those questions but I think getting a solid schema down will always be the first step.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Definitely.

Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Favorite Project: Book Club, the tables and relationships were easy enough to learn but complicated enough that Amy and I had to do a lot of thinking and planning to get things right.

Least Favorite Project: Little Shop, working with four people for the first time was tough, especially since I was gone for 4 of the days during the project. The schema was pretty messy too, making querying for information an exercise in patience and perseverance.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

How to write Active record and SQl queries, where to start a project (Schema and a completable chunk using TDD), and where to work on my project (some at school, some at home and some elsewhere, preferably with windows).

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

How and when to break up the work to maximize time and team member's strengths and cover their learning goals.

Community
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I paired with some of the mod 1 students to help them with some of the basics of ruby. It was empowering for me and I think helpful for them.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I want to continue pairing with people in both mod 1 and 2, giving lightening talks, write a few more blog posts and actually participate in a posse.

Member of a Posse
What did you do with your posse over this module?
I joined the slack channel for the 3d printing posse but didn't actually participate in any activities with the rest of the folks in the posse.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
Learning some extra skills and building/reinforcing relationships/connections with other people.

How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?
From the outside looking in, I imagine it would help me professionally to build extra relationships with other students and instructors outside of the classroom and have a specialized interest to talk about with new contacts.
