# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I learned to write code in Pascal and C in college over 20 years ago. I set out to update and sharpen my back end coding skills. I think I have definitely accomplished that goal within the scope of what's taught in this module. I have practiced and updated my skills by learning OOP in Ruby

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with getting extremely nervous during evaluations, especially paired ones. It crushed  my ability to perform according to my skills and knowledge. The more CFUs and Independent challenges I took the more comfortable I became. I plan to overcome it for future paired assessments by practicing timed evaluations with a partner.

I also talked to Allison about overcoming this and she gave me very useful information and advice. I also participated in the stress management Gear Up. I learned to calm down with guided meditation, journaling and even preparing a desert.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects for this module were Enigma and Battleship. I loved the challenge of building both projects. Working through Enigma was so much fun because I had a great partner. We did a great job solving the problem on the board before sitting down to code. We complemented each other very well and glided through building this project together. I enjoyed Battleship because for the same reasons with the exception I got to do it by myself.

My least favorite project was Sorting Cards because I had to scrap my code and restart.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- Time management
- Design
- Finish your project and then refactor.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

- Team work is not always easy. But I also have to be able to adapt to working with different personalities.
- Two heads can solve problems better than just one.
- Pairing

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I contributed to the Turing community by helping classmates when they had questions about work or projects. I also contributes by being friendly and connecting with those who seem to have a hard time building new relationships. I also think my lightning talk was fun and my classmates learned something new from it.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to pair with students from lower mods and help them out.
