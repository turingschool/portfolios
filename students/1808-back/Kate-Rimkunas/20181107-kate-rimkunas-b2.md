## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Code alongs - This was a very different style than last mod and I struggled to find balance between keeping up, taking notes, and viewing the lesson. I was never able to feel comfortable with it, although, I did compulsively make git commits which helped. I still feel like a mess, but hopefully, having two weeks off (although I'll be crashing on a couch at my parent's place in NY) will give me some time to organize and reflect on how I can do better next mod.
- I never felt comfortable - I never felt like I knew what to expect on any given day, or for any given challenge. I guess this kept me on my toes, and maybe emulates real life, but it was difficult for me as a learning environment. I think I gained a huge appreciation for feedback though, and often took evals as one of the best places to ask questions and make connections - that last! (I hope hah)
- I didn't know when the intention of a task was to talk/teach or to get something done in time. - I feel like I stole some learning from people, and maybe came off a little overwhelming; now that I understand more often than not the goal is primarily to discuss, I'll ask what the goal is more often.

Summary (1-3 sentences):
Using comment tags (TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE, & custom) for effective teamwork, communication, collaboration. Also covers how to retrieve the notes from the terminal with rake notes.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Yes & No --- It sort of didn't take very much time to do. I think I attempted it on about 4 occasions. While it was nice exposure, I feel like I forgot things between attempts and so I don't think it had as much impact as the ActiveRecord I did in projects.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorites:
- Little Shop (group) - We didn't finish the project, but it was the first project I really relied on and utilized my group. We spend the first ~6 days working nearly exclusively together and it felt really great. I learned a ton and I felt like I was able to help teach as well. It was just a really good experience between the group and the project itself was insane compared to what we'd done before (in a good way, at least after those first 6 days lol)
- Little Shop (solo) - I failed to complete my choice task. For making multiple user addresses, I immediately visualized the DB and partials and thought I'd be set to do it .... unfortunately, on my first go of changing the DB structure to the final structure (in one go), I broke 116-118 tests of 148 and it was overwhelming. I also didn't realize how complicated the app structure and resources were compared to our group submission, which I think was actually my biggest failed when I got overwhelming. I learned through doing the other assignment, where some of the controllers were actually pointing and if I had more time, I'd dive into the project from the start again (for the 3rd time). I hope to do this over the break as well. Additionally, there were SO MANY joins tables for the statistics (which my group never got to attempt muchless complete), that when the DB structure changed they ALL broke and I felt like I couldn't even attempt to resolve them in my remaining time. It was really cool to see your code and structure though, and this task felt way more real-life than previous projects. I wish I had done better; but I'm not giving up on it completely. This project (both assignments) also helped me appreciate and get more comfortable with TDD.
Least Favorite:
- Little Shop (group) - Sessions (login/cart) took my group, of 4, 6 days to figure out, and while that was a lasting learning experience, I feel like that could have gone much smoother with project time shorted and that time focused on smaller independent projects/homeworks.
- Book Club - this was a fine project, went smoothly, but I think I would have preferred frequent homeworks instead with that time to build some muscle memory about all the rails/rake commands and general habits of working within the rails structure. Also, finishing learning topics we should have used in that project (like name spacing) like the day or so before the project was due (and which would impact every file we touched) prevented my partner and I from actually getting to utilize them and I still feel uncomfortable namespacing.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I got to explore a little more frequently, but I don't think I learned very much more from them than any other project. The first app, LaughTracks, feels almost irrelevant compared to the rails projects.


What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
- I learned how to verbalize better, especially in a drive/nav sense.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I sort of tapped out this mod. I had some home-issues and felt overwhelmed most of the mod. Through all of last mod and half of this mod it was a primary goal that I at least attend the optional events like the friday speakers and wrap up and what not, but I found myself exhausted by friday, especially in the 2.5 weeks I was pretty sick this mod , and also leaving the basement to work in wholefoods when I had free time (sometimes people I invited came too ). I didn't really contribute to the community beyond daily class hours and conversations, and I frankly don't regret it, although I have better intentions next mod.
- Gear-ups were really great this mod though and I really enjoyed participating.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- All optional events
- More time with cohort
