## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to understand the MVC architecture and successfully implement a Rails app.

ActiveRecord. I learned that I need to improve my understanding of the ORM-database interaction.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

I don't think the active record obstacle course was a good measure of what we learned, not was it an effective way to learn it. I found it to be an onerous distraction.


## Projects

The final solo project wasn't all that enjoyable. There wasn't very much time to get into it, and little room for making personal contributions.

I learned the overall architecture of a Rails app. Understanding the responsibilities of MVC, specifically the logic each part is responsible for.

How to collaborate with a team, and how to be flexible about the contributions I make.


## Community

I announced the 3d printing posse.

I feel as though focussing on the community weakens my learning. I don't have time for posses. I felt too frustrated with my work to want to be in the basement after hours.
