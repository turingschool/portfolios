## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
To understand rails, and how MVC works to create a web application. Was also excited to learn how to feature test using capybara, writing tests that would navigate a web page was fun. Also seeing how working on a group project would play out. I had the opportunity to work with some smart people and I learned alot from them. Overall I set out to learn how a rails application really works when there are multiple user stories involved and how a team can split up the responsibilities in an effective manner. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with activerecord alot in the beginning, the errors seemed funky. The activerecord obstacle course was helpful, doing that a few times helped me figure out what was going on, understanding how relationship tables worked was key. This struggle reminded me that I still have alot more to learn. Also it reminded me that with enough time I can figure things out.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
This was extremely helpful, I used it as a sort of cheat sheet for figuring out how to set up queries outside of the obstable course. When I would get stuck on a active record problem, I'd open up the obstacle course and it'd give me a couple ideas of how to possibly get to a solution I was after. 


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I liked blogger, wasn't really a project persay but I learned the most from that in terms of understanding how MVC works. It was a good step by step guide that helped me piece together all the missing pieces I needed when I felt lost. It made navigating all the other projects much easier. I'd say my least favorite project was book club it was one of the first ones we had to build in rails and seeding the data manually seemed like insanity. When I learned about what factorybot and faker were tho seeding data didn't seem as crazy as I originally thought. I think mainly I didn't like book club was because I wasn't aware of the tools out there available that would make certain aspects easier, it wasn't until the next project, little shop where I had teamates that were really into factorybot and faker that I saw how much time they saved.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned what my strengths were, and more importantly what my weaknesses were. Time management when you're accountable to a team is almost inevitable, being solo was a different story juggling different deadlines was not as straight forward for me. Prioritizing what I needed to be working on at the time was much easier using tools like waffle, so next solo project I have Imma let my ocd loose and plan out my deadlines accordingly so I'm not rushing to get a bunch done right near the end. 

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
I learned that people can surprise ya. I had one partner leave during a project and then got a team that was great. I didn't think i'd like working with the group as much as I did. I learned that it's easier for me to stay on track with a team, deadlines were alot easier to stay on top of, also that we all had our individual interests that we could learn from. One of my partners was really good at factory bot and learning about about what I could do and actually using it in our project made understanding the benefits alot easier. 

## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I went to as many turing events as I could and participated in the NASA challenge and got an award for creativity with other turing students. Not sure if that's contributing but it felt good going out with the turing folks and working on something together outside of turing. I made sure that if anyone in module 1 had a question or needed help I would make time for them. 
I went to a pay it forward gear up not too long ago that had a big impact on me so I wanna keep helping where I can.



What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to pair with as many students as I can and help anyone that asks. Also I want to participate in demo night, I've had a couple personal project ideas I've been working on and off with some others and I'm hoping to be able to share em with the community next mod, I think we might win but who knows I don't wanna give too many details but I think it's something that'll 
be worth watching. 

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?
We played dominoes, watched movies, gone out dancing. We made sure to hangout together outside of turing. I'm involved with a few groups, there's alot of overlap with our gatherings. About once a week one of use will offer an oppurtunity to get together and the slack channels are pretty lively. We went to a couple cybersecurity events, a few start up talks, a couple comedy shows and sang alot of kareokee.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
The inside jokes. Also bonding over kareokee, it's surprising how many people enjoy the kareoke. Posses are a good way to meet students in other cohorts. 

How has your posse expereince helped you grow as a professional?
I've been able to connect with a wider network of like minded individuas. The conversations are diverse enough so that I feel as though I'm learning something new either about life or the individuals I'm speaking with.
