## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I have always had high expectations for myself, so it wasnt any different with this mod. As always, my goal was to learn, understand, and be able to implement the new skills presented. I knew this mod would be difficult and wanted to be sure I was consistently putting in 100% effort, and I feel like I performed to the best of my abilities throughout the mod since I know I couldn't dedicate any more time to Turing if I tried. I am happy with my success and what I have learned thus far, while eager to deepen my knowledge and experience.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled most with the volume of new information presented in this mod, and wanting to master all of it. Its been nailed home to me throughout this mod that I need to accept that I wont be the master developer I want to be for some time to come because my learning journey is just beginning, and really wont ever end. I need to make sure I have realistic expectations for myself and not be too hard on myself when I find myself struggling. I also need to work on my nervousness, since it is an internal struggle and doesn't reflect my skills and abilities, but sometimes comes through.

Summary (1-3 sentences): I decided to write about the routing in Rails, focusing on the `config/routes.rb` file and the output of `rails routes`. I intended the article to be basic introduction to routing in Rails, for junior developers who have a basic understanding of HTTP and RESTful routing. 

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Yes, I did find this helpful. I think if we didnt have the obstacle course, it would've been harder to find time to practice AR exercises on our own time.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I really enjoyed the two group projects we had because I worked with people who were able to teach me things, and I felt like the skill sets of my partners were similiar to mine, creating a good working relationship where I was both a teacher and a student to my partners. My least favorite project was the final solo project, becuase both of my extensions consisted mostly of Active Record statistical methods, so it was personally frustrating to spend about a week on 6 decently short methods. It was challenging and worthwile, but I didnt enjoy it. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I like working independently and enjoy struggling through a problem on my own, so I always find independent projects to be a good learning experience. However, I learned that I can definitely need to practice self care when working independently, in the form of taking personal poms and reaching out for help more often when I get stuck, to make my own time more effecient and worthwhile. I've always had a strong work ethic and am glad I have it to carry me through the independent projects. 

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

Since we did our first group project this mod, I found it to be an interesting experience. I learned that organization and communication is vital to a group coding project's success, and can't be overemphasized. I found my paired/group experiences to be positive and offered many new things to learn; I got more experience in CSS through one of my paired projects, and learned new ways of feature testing through shoulda-matchers in teh group project.


## Community 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I always strive to be a kind and approachable person, and consider my cohort to be my closest community at Turing. Our cohort continues to bond through outside study groups and work time, as well as social actitivies we encourage each other to participate in to help keep each other sane. I try to be a valuable member of this community as someone who is helpful and compassionate to my fellow students.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I am thinking about starting a faith-posse, but havent decided on it yet and am not sure its a commitment I'm ready to take on.
