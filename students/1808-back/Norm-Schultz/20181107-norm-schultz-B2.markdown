## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I intended to learn Rails, improve my testing and pairing practices, and get a generally better view of web development. I think I was mostely successful (some of these are ongoing).

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with about half the lessons. I felt like some didn't cover things in a logical way and when I returned to the lesson after the lecture the online page didn't help. The result was a lot more Googling and asking around. I learned a lot from this, but it was haphazard and stressful. I did, though, pick up some better habits of checking over my work and testing out code.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

Yes

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Favorite: Book club - because I got to work with a great partner and it was the first professional-looking dynamic website I worked on.

Leaste Favorite: Slugs - because it took 14 hours and there wasn't a lot of good guidance on how to diagnose errors when you implement slugs on an existing project. The existing code and tests were hard to understand since I didn't write them. In the end the routing wasn't intuitive either.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I improved my ability to research and try things out on my own.

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

I improved my ability to motivate/organize people and problem-solve.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Whenever I'm done with a task or have completed a project early I always circulate to see if I can help problem-solve and "rubber duck" for people. I also gave a couple of my fellow mod2 folks some general study-habits and note-taking guidance, as well as generally supporting them to improve as students and be more responsible. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to keep doing what I'm doing.
