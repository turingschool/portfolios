## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Understanding how the internet works more than just entering URLs into browsers
Even though I still think there is a lot to learn on this subject. I also wanted
to learn how to transform Ruby scripts from terminal messages into web apps. Even
though I didn't deploy anything this mod I have a better understanding of how that
will work.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

At first MVC was very confusing. Now it seems so simple. It was probably week 2 or 3
that it really clicked on what is supposed to be where.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I don't know if I have a favorite or least favorite. I like Book Club a lot because
I felt like I learned a lot about how to implement CRUD on Rails.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

Improved Active Record and more confidence setting up tables/migrations.

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

I learned so much in both the paired and group projects. I don't even know where
to start. Both projects felt like a struggle at first and being able to collaborate
with a partner/team helped get over that hump.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to help fellow students whenever I could. The problem for me helping was I often didn't feel confident enough in the material to offer my help.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to be able to help my peers more. Hopefully I can help the new mod 2 students next mod as I will be confident with the material they are learning.
