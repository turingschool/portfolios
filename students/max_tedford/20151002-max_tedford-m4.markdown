# Max Tedford - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

After my last portfolio review I was asked by the staff to continue to be a community
leader that cultivates the ethos of the cohort/school, organize fun activities to
keep people involved, and focus more on the soft side of things, particularly the Turing
culture. As such, I once again spearheaded Turing Field Day which took place on Friday,
September 18th, in addition to serving on Student Advisory Board for the second consecutive
module. I attended all six sessions. In response to staff feedback at the end of module 3,
I decided to pivot away from the wine-themed three-part series of lightning talks I had lined
up to discuss Alan Turing and his cultural influence on the Turing School, its curriculum,
and its culture of inclusion. Finally, I made a point at the beginning of the module to cultivate
my posse and serve as a supportive leader amongst my more junior peers. I accomplished this by
regularly attending and participating in warm-ups, setting up pairing sessions with my posse classmates
and scheduling times to stay late or come in early to assist them with their projects.
 
Simultaneously, my biggest personal goal was to hit the job hunt hard and find a job in Washington DC
by graduation. Whether I actually have a job by the day I graduate is admittedly a but out of my
control, but the level of effort I dedicate towards finding one is not. Over the course of the
module I secured interviews with LivingSocial, Contactually, TrackMaven, WeddingWire, CustomInk,
Morning Consult, and LearnZillion. I completed code challenges for Contactually and Morning Consult,
and am presently in the midst of the recruiting process with Morning Consult, WeddingWire, CustomInk,
and LearnZillion. In addition, I've applied to countless jobs via online portals and activated my DC
network in the hopes of finding additional opportunities. I am overall pleased with my job-hunt efforts,
though I remain disappointed that I haven't yet nailed down a position.

## Individual

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/revenge_of_idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

In this three-day project I re-implemented IdeaBox using JavaScript. It was peer-evaluated by Whitney with the
following results:

Reviewer: Whitney Hiemstra

* Features -- 3: All of the base expectations were met
* User Interface -- 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* Testing -- 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
* Rails Style -- 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC,
and push business logic down where it belongs
* Ruby Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* JavaScript Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored

* Comments:
Liked how your files and code were well-organized -- JS code was all in one file, but very easy to read and understand.
Liked your use of respond_with and ajax calls -- site was responsive and quick.

* Improvements:
Would have liked to see a before_action in controller -- replacing all the Idea.find(params[:id])

#### LinkedListJS

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/linked_list_js)

In this weekend project I implemented an object-oriented recursive linked list using JavaScript. It was
peer-evaluated by Margarett with the following results:

Reviewer: Margarett Ly

* Functional Expectations 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* Test-Driven Development 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and
integration using appropriate data
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with
a clear, single responsibility
* Javascript Fundamentals 4: Application makes excellent use of JS techniques, including fluid and consistent
manipulation of Objects and Functions
* Looping or Recursion 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

* Comments: 
Code very compact and well divided for each object model. It's easy to look at each method and understand
what your code does. Excellent use of recursion. Tests are clear and straight-forward. I like that you called methods
that you had already written from within other methods. Naming is a little ambiguous.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/scale_up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

This was a ten-day project in which I inherited a prior pivot and optimized it for scale. It was evaluated by Horace
with the following results:

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting 3
* Database Load yes
* Optimization Techniques 3
* Features - Pagination yes

* Comments:
Good average perf/throughput (150/200ms , 200-300 rpm range)
Load script is thorough and covers our bases
uses good balance of view caching and basic query optimization thanks to pagination
Next steps would be to investigate more of the problematic queries, especially around categories, and also leverage
caching more at the data layer

#### Reading List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/reading_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/worace/0fa8052bfcf983e8722d)

This 7-hour practice challenge involved building a basic rails app that allowed an authenticated user to add links
to their personal reading list. It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Progress 3
* Ruby Style 3
* Rails Style 3
* JS 4
* Testing 3
* UI 3

#### Final Assessment (Goober)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/final_assessment)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/worace/b55b02194d014b324e7b)

This final assessment for module 4 required me to build a light-weigh version of Uber on the web. It was evaluated
by Horace with the following results:

* Satisfactory Progress 3
* Ruby Syntax and Style 3
* Rails Style and API 4
* Testing 4
* User Interface 3
* Javascript (if applicable) N/A

* Comments:
Interesting take on rider / driver division and modeling
Awesome testing; exceptionally thorough on feature/integration tests
Still some room for more granular model tests and larger, less granular integration tests
Nice use of PORO for ride duration / distance estimation

#### Contactually-Lite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/contactually-lite)

This was a four-day code challenge I completed for Contactually in Washington, DC as a part of their interview
process. It's a basic rails app that parses and TSV file and stores it into a contacts database before subsequently
displaying it on the user's show page. It also includes AJAX and JS filtering.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/lights_out)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this ten-day project I worked with Vane to build out a front-end recreation of Lights Out! The project was
evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental JS and JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

* Comments:
Game UI is fun and useable; fancy use of css
Testing super thorough; seems to cover all cases in the small as well as the large
Firm application of OO style
Rendering logic encapsulated by each game component
Pretty good job of keeping jquery out of most of the code (isolating it to the rendering stuff)
Super solid application of OO JS style

#### Flack

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/flack)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/flack-node)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)

* Services - 4
* Encapsulation - 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 4
* Project Management - 3
* Concept - 2
* Deployment - 2
* Features - 3; got basic auth and standard chat setup with multi rooms; next steps would have
been to push this further

* Comments:
Testing seems great
Pretty successful effort working with multi-application architecture and managing data flow through the various pieces
Chat ui is pretty nice although basic UI of the rest of the app suffers
Didn't get too deep into the theming / product aspects of the project
Supporting multi channels successfully is cool
Took a stab at deploying but need to figure out env variable management
Got lots of practice with node
interesting use of rails-side rendering to distribute html partials to chat participants

### Feedback to Me

* Max is one of the best students in all of Turing. He is so easy to work with, always helpful and incredibly
hard-working. He is always willing to stop what he is doing to help anyone. If there was anyone I could work
with in a job, it would be Max. Any company that hires Max is super lucky.
* I didn't have a chance to work with Max this module, so can't speak to any mod4-specific projects, but Max is
one of the strongest developers and people in our cohort. He's always willing to help out his peers and I'm really
glad I was able to go through the Turing experience with him.
* Max was a great teammate on our project this module. He was very engaged, helped drive the project forward, and
contributed well-written code the whole way. He was a pleasure to team up with and I definitely hope our paths cross
again professionally.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Sally, Justin, and Drew solicited me for feedback and I was happy to provide it.

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, September 25, I delivered a lightning talk about Alan Turing and his contributions to the Turing School
* On Friday, July 18, I organized (in conjunction with Jamie Kawahara) a Turing field day for students and staff
* Throughout the duration of the module I participated in Student Advisory Board, providing
feedback to the staff on improving Turing. I attended all meetings and actively contributed throughout.


## Review

### Notes

* Accomplished meeting many of current Turing community and being known throughout. Was a very good influence and model for the turing student body. 
* Did fantastic job with cultivating his posse and being active in trying to build that relationship. 
* Was a little occupied with job hunt in the end and projects slightly suffered. But good work overall
* Everyone enjoys your presence and tries a little harder with you around. 
* People do there best work when you're invloved
