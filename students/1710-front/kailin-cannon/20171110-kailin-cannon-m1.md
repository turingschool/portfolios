# Kailin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of Javascript more than anything else. I also wanted to solidfy the CSS skills I had coming in with a strong base, as well as learn how to more easily and quickly lay out a page.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three Static Compositions.

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Goal was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### Student: Kailin Cannon
#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

* Time management! Get started earlier!
* Work on sytax and spacing
* Consider adding comments to CSS for better organization
* Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

#### Functional Expectations
* Novice: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.  
* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

My first attempt at using flexbox. Comments were that I needed to fix images so that they're responsive & fix the wonky stuff happening at the bottom of the page when squished.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I was pretty happy with this one, except for the "princesses" section title which kept just wiggling all around on it's own. It's an anarchist. It doesn't care about rules.

Comments I received were that I maybe needed to change the color of the cards based on the background color, and that the cards should always align left even if they don't make up a full row (instead of being centered). Also still need to work on smallest mobile view to avoid lots of 'fat finger' situations. Icons need to change hover color along with text. Less typography fun :(


#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Ohhhh my god there's so many elements on this page. Definitely the first time I've run into issues with bouncing back and forth between tasks. On smaller projects it doesn't matter so much, but when there's 75 different things on the page I need to change I need to focus on getting one thing done first before I move on to something else, instead of just doing random amounts of everything.

### EVALUATION PENDING TILL FRIDAY 9AM

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox-Pivot.

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A small application that used form inputs to append things to the other side of the page, for the purpose of making a little URL bookmark-tracker. There were buttons to delete bookmarks, and to mark a bookmark as 'read'. 

#### Student: Kailin and Amanda
#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes/What To Work On:

- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

#### Feedback Received:
> To start off, the final result of our project was awesome! I was really happy with how it turned out after all of our hard work. Even though at the end we both agreed there were a few things that could've been tweaked, I think we did a great job. As far as the pairing went, I think we were able to work through most issues that came up. We both have very different working styles, and I think that we could both learn from each other. When I am being nitpicky, I am really just trying to get as much as I can out of everything we're learning and start putting into practice the "best practices" we're going to need when we're working. I recognize that maybe you don't usually work like that, but I feel like right now we're in a situation that we should be thorough with our work. In addition, I want to be as thorough as possible with my CSS and I was disappointed that you didn't give me more feedback on the CSS when I asked you since it is one of your strengths. I think the most important part of a pairing project is learning as much as we can both from the actual work itself and from our partner. We all have different strengths in abilities and work styles, and I was excited to learn more about CSS from you and I was hoping to be able to help you with the JavaScript. You're doing a great job at using the resources we have at Turing: people from other mods, our teachers, and other people in our class. Just don't forget that your partner is also a resource. It hurt a little when you went to other people in Mod 4 and in our class before even talking to me about a problem, and I felt kind of dismissed when I asked you about what you were working on and if I could help. I would've loved to be more part of those moments when you were taking advantage of our resources at school. I don't think it was your intention, but there were times when I felt disrespected, for example when I felt dismissed because I didn't fully know jQuery yet, even though I am quite strong and understand the logic behind JavaScript. Again, I don't think that this was your intention, which is why I am telling you these things so that we can both get better at pairing in general. If you want to sit down and talk about this, I would be more than happy to have an open and compassionate conversation. And I think that we should both be really happy with how good-looking and solid our final project came out.

### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

A project where someone could save ideas they had by entering them into input fields that would append to the page. The idea could be upvoted or downvoted in quality and there were search and filtering options for the ideas.

### Student: James and Kailin
### Evaluator: David
### Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on the filtering extension!

#### HTML
* Work on proper indentation ie body should be tabbed in one from the html tags
* Make sure that spacing is consistent in html - ideally the tabbing should be enough and additional spaces should not be necessary

#### CSS
* Work on indentation and spacing in css
* Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
* Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces 

#### JS
* Work on passing objects instead of object properties
* Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card 
* Work on more consistent spacing and indentation(no need for blank lines in functions)
* Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
* Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Student: Kailin and Ophus
#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes/What To Work On:

- overwhelmed by working within an existing codebase, struggled to track logic and thought process of original developer's code.
- focused on refactoring JS, no new functionality. JS still had opportunities for refactoring and clean up.
- didn't add any additional functionality, not all Ideabox functionality is solid (filter is case sensitive and hitting `enter` to leave an input isn't hooked up)
- localStorage broken on Ophus's machine, unclear what is going on, works on Kailin's (different branches locally?)
- lots of buggy behavior: first time upvote hits "critical" it becomes "undefined" on page load, and returns to "critical" after refreshing the page.
- CSS has a lot of opportunities for further refactoring, many unused properties and cruft. Make sure you are keeping in mind foundational CSS rules and box-model as you write CSS. Much of what is written in this codebase is either doing nothing (ie `display: block` on elements that are block by default (like a div, for example) or using `margin: auto` on elements that also have `display: inline-block` on them) or overriding properties in the same rule.
- I expected more progress to be made on this project, although it does seem like both team members learned a lot from the process of fighting with this code base, which is fantastic. Learning is always the #1 goal. It is unclear if it was a time management problem or if what was asked of them was overwhelming and the team didn't feel comfortable reaching out for help to get unstuck.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The growth mindset session was actually weird. It made me examine things in my past that I hadn't thought about in years. I generally viewed my high school experience positively, but this session made me remember the negatives about it. It was very much a 'fixed mindset' environment to grow up in, but I don't think it ever really heavily impacted me? I had a big 'I do what I want, I think what I want' attitude as a teen and really solid, dependable friendships. And then I immediately moved 8 hours away from where I went to high school and was totally free of that sort of environment ever since. Still, its odd to think that as I move about in a forward-thinking environment, there are still many places all over the world that don't foster a growth-mindset attitude.


#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I think this might've been my favorite Gear Up. Kathy Sierra's keynote was incredibly interesting. With the 'all one tank' concept in mind, I've been going about my life examining how many cognitive resources things I do everyday take up. At Turing I think I've started to timebox myself better because of it.


#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I think I've bounced around on the spectrum. I've had friends insist I'm an extrovert, but I feel like it's because they don't really know the meanings of the terms. I'm not quiet, but I am kind've shy, I just fake that I'm not. And being out and around people really drains me of energy like nothing else does, which is the main reason I've always called myself an introvert. As far as the session went, I think I've always assumed that working with extroverts would be hard, and I've realized that as long as both parties are willing to compromise, it's not as hard as I made it out to be.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I felt like this was the least valuable Gear Up for me. I didn't really enjoy mapping out my personal story in the 'timeline, hills-and-valleys' style that we did. The group share portion was better, Jordan and I ended up in a group and we'd also group-talked for the growth mindset fashion, so he remembered portions of my story that I'd brought up back then, and we also related on some new things too. I'd like to get better at identifying others' values before there's a conflict, rather than realizing afterwards why they may have reacted the way they did. 


#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This session was a really weird mix of super-relatable and totally not-relatable. My mom is a single mother who works in a male-dominated industry, so growing up I never had that 'girls can't do science/math stuff' experience because my mom is an industrial electrician. So that wasn't relatable. But I've also spent an abnormal amount of time in the 'world' of online-gaming, which is one of the most toxic, male-dominated places ever, so I've experienced a lot of what females getting harrassed in workplaces have experienced. In the end I think it's prepared me extremely well for a male-dominated workplace, but watching the video and hearing of those experiences was super-relatable. I'm not intimidated by being in male spaces at all, so I really hope that I can always be there for someone who might not be as confident.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Our class all pooled together money to buy breakfast burritos for mod2 because of how much they helped us! Personally I don't think I've helped out very much, because I'm just starting out and I feel like I'm usually farther behind than others in the class so I'm not the person people go to for help. Hopefully when pairing in mod2 I can give really clear explanations to people I'm paired with and help out a bit more.
