## A: End of Module Assessment

I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 3.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were Sorting-Suite, Complete-Me, and Weathrly, which is usually a pair project, but which I did solo. 

### Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this individual project, I built the sorting algorithms for bubble-sort, insertion-sort, merge-sort, and quick-sort.

#### Evaluator: Leta


### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this individual project, I built a search Trie using javascript. 

#### Evaluator: Leta

### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Normally a pair project, I was assigned Weathrly as a solo project. I built a Weather application using the Weather API, Javascript, React, and the Jest testing framework. I used my Complete-Me autocomplete search trie to implement autocomplete search functionality when querying the Weather API.

### Instructor Evaluation Points: weathrly
### Instructor: Leta

#### Specification Adherence

score: 3++

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


#### User Interface

score: 3+

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


#### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


#### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


#### JavaScript / React Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach to design and component architecture.


#### Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.


#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My only group project this mod was GameTime.

### (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For this project, I worked with Bruce Chung to build a platformer videogame, called 'NightFall'. We built our game using Javascript with ES6 syntax, and html canvas. We used three stacked canvases and a game loop to render multiplayer gameplay on the screen, including both versus and co-op modes, and multiple player-selectable characters and AI enemies.

### Evaluator: Leta && Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints



## D: Professional Skills Development

### Gear Up
#### Community Gearup - Ethics of Open Source

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_3.md)

For this session with Mod4, we talked about ethics in the context of the open source community. We discussed the different kinds of creative licenses, strategies for being involved in open source, and the benefits of different open source models. We talked a lot in our group about the tension between commercial value and community knowledge and or learning, and the difference between product and language when it comes to what we want to share as open source.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

In this session we discussed the attention economy, how it plays a role in our everyday interactions, especially technology based interactions, and our responsibility when designing and building applications. I found the concept of the attention economy to be interesting, and to be something which I am very aware of when working with technology. I think it is important that we take the ways in which applications interrupt our focus and compete for our attention, and the implications of the ways in which we take advantage of attention grabbing strategies, and the tension between developing applications which people are drawn to use and our moral obligation as developers.


#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

In this session we talked about the ways privilege and empathy impact our community at Turing, how we have been impacted by them as individuals, and how we can work to discuss privilege and our experiences with it so that we may better understand our own experiences and the experiences of others, and empathize with them. For me, the biggest take away, and something that I really appreciate about our class, is that we need to be open to sharing, and willing to listen to other peoples experiences, and to always think about the ways our interactions are impacting others, or our biases are showing themselves. In my group, we talked about the ways some implicit biases impact our actions, and how we must forgive ourselves for them, but also always work to be better.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I made an effort to participate in the Turing community with a focus on Javascript. I attended and participated in Iron FE, lead a class on Mythical Creatures for Mod 1, and created practice exercises for others to work on. I also made an effort to make myself available for pairing, both with Mod 1 students, and with my classmates, as well as to be involved in sharing what I have worked on, both at Code Fair and Demo night. Next Mod, I hope to take on a leadership role in Iron Fe, as well as participate more actively in Pahlka.
