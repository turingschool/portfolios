# James Logue M4 Portfolio

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I am happy with the work that I put into my capstone. Although I would have liked to build more features, and plan to continue working on it, it was a lot of fun digging into the various 3D and VR technologies available for Javascript programmers, and seeing what worked and what didn't. I learned a lot  about 3d and mapping technologies, and, even though we weren't able to use most of the libraries we looked at, learning about what they could and couldn't do was a valuable experience. 

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
It was also interesting diving back into regular JS for building our frontends this mod, and not using React. It was a challenge, and an adjustment, but it made me appreciate how much I have learned at Turing.
The biggest struggle for me this mod was trying to balance starting my job search with classwork and projects. Because mod4 covers so much, we were learning something new every day, it was a challenge to remain focused and present for that and absorb all the lessons, while also having the time to work on jobs.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I really enjoy working with backend technologies, and feel like I would be happy working in a backend role. I knew that I wanted to be familiar with the full stack, and building Api's myself has made me appreciate some of the well designed Api's I used in previous mods.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
How important working with other people is in programming, to always keep learning, and to ask questions. 

#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).
