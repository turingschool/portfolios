## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to cement my knowledge of React, and feel comfortable with Redux and Router, with an emphasis on building fully tested applications. I tried to focus on becoming confident and comfortable with enzyme and jest, and to fully wrap my head around the ways that Async && fetch calls work.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 4.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were SwapiBox and my Personal Project

#### (Swapi-Box)

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/jjlljj/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

I was asked to create a React App using data from the Star Wars API (SWApi). I implemented Router to handle page navigation, and all of the deeply nested asynchronous API calls required to pull the data for display were thoroughly tested with Enzyme and Jest. The landing page features a text crawl based on the opening sequence of the movies, with text randomly selected from one of the films. The application also features card pages with information about characters, planets, and vehicles found in the films, and a favorites page where users can view favorited cards.

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3.5  - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints
### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.# SWapi-Box Eval


#### (Personal Project)

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/jjlljj/personal-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)


I want to build a web application which assesses text content for tone using the Watson API and gives the user feeback on that content within the context of negotiation and conflict resolution. This web application could be used as a teaching tool for mediators and negotiators, as well as as a tool to provide additional information in written negotiation.

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested


### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects I worked on this mod were Headcount2.0 and MovieTracker

#### (Headcount2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

In this project, we were given a static data file and asked to dynmically render the data using React. The data files contained education data for the state of Colorado and we had to compare data between different state districts. We imported the data, cleaned the data, and then used React and javascript to implement a card comparison UI as outline in the specification. We made changes to the spec to increase usability and adhere to the 10 essential web application usability guidelines. We also built a comprehensive unit and integration testing suite to test all components in the app. To do this, we used Jest, Enzyme, and the Enzyme adapter.


## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3+ - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow
- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master.

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker is a group project that works off The Movie DB API and incorporates our own API to save user information. We had one week to build an application that pulled in the most recent movies from The Movie DB API. Our API allows a user to register and then log in when they return. Also a user can favorite movies, which is then saved in our API so that a user can view their list when they log in again. We also did an extension where a user can click and view more details about any individual movie. The application was built in React.js and Redux. Our testing suites were built using Jest and Enzyme.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

In this gearup, we talked about microaggressions and the ways that we can be more aware of them so that we may spot and take action. We talked about the impact that these aggressions can have, and how hostile small expressions of difference and judgement can be, intentionally or unintentionally.


#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

For this session, we visited the interactive site Parable of the Polygons, which I thought really effectively visualized and communicated just how much impact small collective preferences or actions can have on the shape and structure of the larger hole. We had a very interesting discussion about how it speaks to the power norms not only within the tech community, but within larger society as well, and how we need to think about the way we act and make decisions, because individual actions can resonate with the larger whole to have unwanted and unintended negative consequences.

#### Finding the right Fit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_6.md)

This session was about the differences between different work environments and choosing between the tradeoffs associated with working at startups, mid-size, and large corporations. We discussed the different kind of cultures and support to expect at each, and got some valuable advice from a pair of alums about their work experience, including their perspective on working remotely.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to actively participate in the Turing community this mod by making myself available for pairing and providing support to other students. I also engaged with the larger tech community in Denver by attending meetups, and participating in a 3 day hackathon.
