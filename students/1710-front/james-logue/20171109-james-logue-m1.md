## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 2.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were the Number Guesser and the three Static Comp Challenges. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For my Number Guesser, I created a two player game where the players alternately try to guess the number. The game keeps track of the score, game gives feedback based on the user input, and each player is on a timer while it is their turn.

## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Yay for two player!
- Minor polishing with design but stays true to spirit of comp
- Be sure to use error messaging so that user receives clear message as to why certain data (letters or being outside of the range) isn't being accepted  - this was part of the reqs of Phase 2
- Good start for organizing CSS
- Nice naming in JS. Some longer functions that you use refactoring

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.  
* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

#### Static-Comp-1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/jl-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For this Project, we were given a static comp to recreate using HTML/CSS. Our version had to be true to the original layout, while also being mobile responsive. For this comp I utilized Flexbox to recreate the tiled appearence of the Original comp.

Evaluation comments
* Leave breathing room between icons and text
* Refine the colors to match the image. Mute the oranges and greens to fit image.
* Be consistent with spacing in top and bottom margins

#### Static-Comp-2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/jl-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This was the second static comp we were given to recreate using HTML/CSS. My version had to be true to the original layout, while also being mobile responsive. For this comp I utilized CSS Grid to recreate the page structure of the Original comp, but also to make it mobile responsive and scalable.

Evaluation comments
* Add active state on one menu item to reflect the comp
* Drop shadow and/or hover state on cards OR add overlay over image that disappears on hover so that the text pops out/doesn’t disappear into the background image
* The cards are getting squished between media queries, have queries kick in earlier
* Challenge: think about how do to deal with really long names/places
* Spacing between cards on mobile is tight.

#### Static-Comp-3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/jl-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This was the third static comp we were given to recreate using HTML/CSS. This layout was far more complex than the previous two, so I really had to be careful when planning out my html and how to apprach the css. 

Evaluation comments
* Some of the media queries are too tight to the content, so think about doing media queries based on common screen sizes, and make the content fit the queries
* Double check scaling edge cases, especially when changing media query min-widths. It's always better to have the media query kick in earlier, or too early, rather than too late.
* The font-weight feels a little heavy, hard to read, but is true to the comp.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were Linked-List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox pivot, which were all similar layouts that built on each other in terms of functionality. I learned a lot about how to work with others to build well structured javascript and jQuery based web apps.

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For this project I worked with Melissa Wagasky. We built a simple app to bookmark all of your favorite sites. You can enter a title and a URL and save those to things to a card. Then you can read those articles and after, mark them as read. Finally, you can keep track of how many articles you've read and how you many you have bookmarked.

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- great job coordinating
- great details, really nice UI additions
- not totally responsive, layout breaks at 320
- fix the little ribbon with the counter on stacked layout -- really nice UI choice, just make sure that its tight!
- massive eventListener -- refactor to small, single responsibility functions that can be called on click

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

#### Partner Feedback

James, I told you this in person but wanted to echo here that I really enjoyed working with you. I learned a lot on our project and you were a thoughtful, organized and hard-working partner. I was nervous going into the project because I knew I would be out of town over the weekend for a wedding. I appreciated the way you jumped straight in with me and were game to plan early on Friday before we left for the day. It made me feel so much better about being away. I appreciated how communicative and organized you were over the weekend as well. We divided up our starting points and you checked in along the way to let me know where you were and to ask where I was. I appreciate how flexible you were about the wedding events that came up during the weekend and when my schedule changed unexpectedly on Sunday. I am really proud of how our actual project turned out and felt lucky to work with you on the first paired project we had this mod. You are a hard worker and you tackle problems head on. Even though I took the first pass at the jQuery, you also looked at it over the weekend and wrapped your head around the problem. This made trouble shooting some of the issues that came up much easier once Monday arrived and we were working together in person. When we ran into bugs and issues, you had a great attitude and persisted through. Thank you for all of your hard work, feedback, and communication. I learned a lot about jQuery and more working with you. I also appreciate how detail-oriented you are and the thoroughness you bring to cleaning and DRYing our code. Those things are important to me and I was grateful to have a partner who valued the same attention to detail. One additional, specific thing I wanted to thank you for - I am not as confident in my code because I feel like such a beginner (as I'm sure we all do) and it can feel really intimidating share my ideas when I'm working with someone as strong and skilled as you. For instance, when I thought we should we should use the event.PreventDefault method in our javascript as opposed to hard coding something in the HTML, I found myself not wanting to stand up for my ideas and shutting down when I wasn't really sure what would work better instead of asserting my opinion. I have to work on my confidence and that is on me - so please know that nothing you were doing caused me to shut down. I believe that you noticed and I appreciate how kind you were about it. Thank you for all of the times where you asked me how I would go about the problems and when you were so encouraging of what I'd built or done. Thank you for being my partner! Hope to work with you again!


#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this project, which I worked on with Kailin Cannon we had to think about the “server” and “client” as separate entities. We used JavaScript & jQuery to manage client-side interactions and JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.

## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Nice work on the filtering extension!

### HTML

* Work on proper indentation ie body should be tabbed in one from the html tags
* Make sure that spacing is consistent in html - ideally the tabbing should be enough and additional spaces should not be necessary

### CSS

* Work on indentation and spacing in css
* Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
* Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces 

### JS

* Work on passing objects instead of object properties
* Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card 
* Work on more consistent spacing and indentation(no need for blank lines in functions)
* Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
* Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## HTML

### Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

### Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

## CSS

### Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

### Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

### Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

## GIT & GITHUB

### Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

### Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

### Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

I worked on this project with Emily Kuckelman. We were given another group's repo from a previous 'IdeaBox' project, and had to take the foreign code code base, refactor it, and add features to create a '2Do Box'. The 2DoBox has the same layout as IdeaBox, with key features changed and added.

## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Clean design. Stays true to the comp. Fully responsive. Additional functionality (importance levels buttons) fits well with the original comp. Be sure that importance rating is aligned with up/down vote buttons. Move 'Show More' button to bottom
- Happy to hear that pairing went well. YAY for doing a DTR!!! Cool to hear that you were whiteboarding as part of the process.
- Love that you are using Waffle. Good naming on commits/branches.
- Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good spacing/indentation. 
- Be sure that your attribute is 'aria-label' on your inputs - not just 'label.' Include ARIA in the HTML you dynamically add with JS. Next time, use a screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader. The contrast on the filter buttons is not sufficient, per accessibility testing. 
- CSS could use clean up. Was able to remove over 20 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading stylesheets and inheritance. Be sure to not assign values of display or inline on elements that are that by default. Outline-style is none by default.
- Overall, JS file looks pretty good. Most functions are single responsibility. Like that there is a single function for edit title/task as well as filtering for importance. Nice use of array prototypes!
Areas for refactoring below:

- Unclear why you are pulling from storage again in lines 75 and 150  - already looping over an array that includes cards you've pulled from storage.
- Unused parameter of 'importance' in Line 175.

#### Partner Feedback

James was an incredible partner. He is highly knowledgable and really good at teaching/ clarifying things that I was not sure on. He does a great job of refactoring and writing dry code. Our DTR was really helpful and the expectations we had for each other were clear and concise. The only advice that I have for James is to just keep being open to teaching others, he did a great job leading a session on Saturday about mythical creatures that helped others and myself as well as strengthening his own skills.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

This session stressed the importance of maintaing a growth mindset while at Turing, and the importance of a growth mindset in improving on any skillset. Maintaining a growth mindset is important when confronted with new and difficult problems, because the process of struggling is important to the endgoal of learning. If you cease to believe that you can learn something, you only ensure that you will not learn that thing. 

### Gear Up
#### Introversion and Extroversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

In this session we discussed the differences in working styles and preferred interactions of introverts and extroverts. We each self-identified, and then talked in groups. This was informative given the timing of the session, because it came just as we were beginning our first group projects, and facilitated a conversation about working styles and personalities.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

Getting better at difficult things stressed the importance of one's relationship with struggle in learning new things. If you maintain the right mindset, you can break down complex problems into smaller palatable issues, then you can more easily tackle the previously seemingly insurmountable task. 

### Gear Up
#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Debugging the gender gap was a discussion about the historic role of women in tech, and the importance of building a level playing field for all people in the tech world. It was a stark reminder of the difficulties and discrination that marginalized groups face in tech, and a call to action for all of us as Turing grads to do our part to work against this both at Turing and in our future workplaces.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was involved with the Turing community during Mod by pairing with mod 2 students, participating in my posse, and by attending Iron-Fe sessions. I especially appreciated the interaction I had with upper mod students in both the FE and BE programs in my posse, as they shared the projects they were working on, and their experiences at Turing. I also tried to make myself available to my classmates within 1710 for pairing and practice on Mythical Creatures and our group projects. Next mod I hope to continue to remain engaged in the Turing community by participating in Iron FE and joining pahlka.
