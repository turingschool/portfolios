# Portfolio Defense - 1710 FE - Ophus Wong

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest struggle this past mod has been less the challenge of learning the integration of the front-end/back-end, and much more to do with embracing my own career/identity transition and personal rebranding. To give some context, my previous profession as a banker (and member of the broader financial services industry) absorbed much of my daily life. Thus, my former  identity (within the community) and much of my career was framed within the confines of whichever company I was working at during that time. One of the other significant struggles I have faced is articulating my transition into the tech industry to those around and why I chose this journey.

Throughout this process, I've come to learn the value of phrases like "yes, but..." and that declarations, such as "I am a former banker" or "I am a front-end developer" are only a fraction of someone's identity. Using "yes, but..." phrases have allowed my transition to seem less abrupt and abrasive when discussing with the professional contacts in my current network. Utilizing these phrases has also allowed me to come to grips and be confident in saying "I am front end developer".

## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I felt that some of my biggest achievements of the module include:
- Being able to embrace the phrase "I am a developer" and articulate my reason for choosing this profession to those around me.
- Becoming accustomed and purposefully seeking out opportunities to struggle/learn

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I believe the one thing I have done this inning that has set me apart from my peers is purposefully seeking out learning and growth opportunities. Whether it was attempting to dig in and learn an entirely different language (like Ruby) to understand an open source project or making the choice to do our capstone project in a Javascript framework that was unfamiliar, I felt that these were all very important opportunities for me to learn (and fail) in a safe space with little to no professional reprecussions. 

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

While it was a fantastic experience understanding how to properly integrate with the back-end, this module definitely cemented my desire and enjoyment of working as a front-end developer. I enjoy working on creating visually enjoyable user experiences and clean, functional aesthetics for an application. As a front-end developer the projects we completed helped me to understand why certain approaches are important for data management/architecture and why front-end devs should take care to pass information correctly to the server/back-end.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

The most important skill that I will take from Turing into my next job is the ability to learn and be able to produce results. It is one thing to say that you are learning - this can be accomplished over the course of a day, a week, or even a year, but become even minorly proficient is something that I feel I've only begun to truly start grasping during my time here at Turing.
