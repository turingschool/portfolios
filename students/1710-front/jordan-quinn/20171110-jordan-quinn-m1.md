# Jordan Quinn - ( 1710-Front End M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I wanted to solidify the foundation I had built prior to Turing, and really push my limits on CSS as that is something I have always struggled with. I believe that I accomplished much more than I expected to, and am honestly pretty amazed at the projects we were able to create as a cohort. Additionally, I had never developed anything in a paired/team scenario. That lack of experience was actually a huge reason why I wanted to come to Turing; I wanted to learn to work better beyond the scope of the individual. All and all, I am extremely pleased with the way this mod went. I even got back into a really strict training/diet regiment, which I never expected to happen but am so happy that it did. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 2.5-3 (depending on the day)

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed!


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed at Turing during mod1 were surprisingly what I struggled the most with. Static comps 1 + 2 seemed to be on a mission to beat me up, and they largely succeeded until I was able to decide to just push harder and know I gave static comp 3 my best effort. Number guesser was an excellent introduction to the course and was A TON of fun to build out.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number guesser was our introduction to receiving and utilizing user input in order to build a game designed around the concept of guessing a number between whatever range of digits the user was to input.  

######Evaluation comments

#### (Static Comp 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/jq-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp 1 was our introduction to a "box" based UI, and was designed to force us to flex our HTML/CSS skills a bit beyond what we had learned at that point in the course (just like everything else(: ). As I mentioned in the overview, these were difficult for me. Largely, I think, because I struggle receiving feedback in-front of large groups. One on one, tear me up oneside and down the other and I'll be a happy camper. I will continue developing that as a crucial skill.

N/A

#### (Static Comp 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/jq-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comp 2 entailed developing a card UI. I felt I progressed significantly here, but still lacked the attention to detail necesarry to recreate the deign to 100% authenticity. 

N/A

#### (Static Comp 3)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/jq-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Static Comp 3 was quite the beast to wrangle. There were so many small details and moving parts, of which I was able to capture the spirit of almost everything (except that damn magnifiying class) and was extremely proud of the work I was able to produce for this project.

Too much whitespace on larger screens and be careful with the way I utilize layout techniques. Grid, though a fun challenge to undertake, was not utilized as effectively as it could have been and ultimately created some headaches.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group work was my favorite part of Mod1, much to my surprise. Going into Turing, I was apprehensive about group projects as I had never done any sort of development in that scope before. It turned out they were an incredible opportunity to push myself, as well as help push my partners and learn from their skillset. I came to really look forward to seeing who my partner would be and developing our working relationship.

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was our first experience with real DOM updating and manipulating based on user input. We had barely scratched the surface of it in Number Guesser, tbut this project really allowed us to flex our JS muscles. It was a great introduction to pairing and I had an excellent experience with Michelle.

######Evaluation comments
"Good error messaging.
Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
Following conventions for commiting but would like to see more than 3 branches for features.
Good spacing/indentation in HTML. Small areas to push forward with ARIA - lang, alt attributes. Don't need to wrap labels around inputs if you are linking with for/id. Run through Chromevox or other screen reader next time.
Good organization of CSS file!
Nice work - no anonymous functions. You both have a clear understanding of event delegation. Both knew what code (including Regex) is doing.
Longer functions in JS could be refactored.
Remove all of your console logs for production ready code - JS line 15."

"I think we did pretty well keeping up a good line of communication. You always let me know what part of the project you were working on before you started and your status along the way. Also, thank you for explaining your thought process on how you wrote JS functions!"

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box introduced us to local storage and persisting changes to the DOM and storage through page refresh, allowing us to create much more powerful applications.

######Evaluation comments
"buggy behavior
quality value disappears in some user cases? unclear what causes it
can still create an idea with nothing in the inputs. details matter, and this is not a small detail.
no disabled state on button
very tidy, clean codebase
CSS uses percentages for height, use a different unit of measure. This can cause very unpredictable behavior/movement/scaling as a user resize the browser window and when you are building more complex UI it will be a major headache.
used no classes, only ids being used in HTML -- not flexible or modular as ids cannot be reused on a page.
UI needs a lot of work. was built at 150% zoom, and is not well executed when it is viewed at 100%."


###### Evaluation Scores

#####Functional Expectations
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
#####HTML
######Accessibility
Novice Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
#####Style
Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
#####CSS
######Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
######Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
#####JAVASCRIPT
######Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
######Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
######Functions & Scope
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
######Arrays
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
######Objects & Prototypes
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
######DOM Manipulation
Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
######GIT & GITHUB
Git
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.
Github
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
#####DESIGN
######Comp Recreation
Novice Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
#####PAIRING
######Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

###### Feedback to Me
"Jordan it was awesome working with you! We made a great team and I appreciated the energy and dedication you brought.  You were willing to meet at any time and put in the effort needed to make the project work even though you were going through a stressful week with the move.  I thought our in-person pairing was excellent because you dove straight into the problem, whereas sometimes I sit and think too long when I should just dive in.  We reached a good balance and tackled some new challenges. If I could offer one piece of advice it would be to keep looking for solutions outside of loops. This is something I'm working on too - there are so many powerful and flexible solutions out there! Hope we get to team up again in the future.""

#### (2Do-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/2Do-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This was BY FAR my favorite project of the mod. Getting to work in somebody else's code base and try to put my brain into their thought patterns was so much fun (being serious. No sarcasm here). Amy and I made an exceptional pair and I felt our project was very successful. We really pushed to create something radically different than the initial comp, while still achieving all the required functionality for the MVP. 

######Evaluation comments
"Toggle load more and potentially not show if there arent more to load
start text in the non rounded portion of inputs
account for long titles and descriptions
html
forms!!!
css
take a look weirdness going on with height ie. height 103%
some inconsistencies in spacing
could comment up the css more
js
passing around properties when objects should be used instead
Work on naming conventions
Weird syntaxy things
git/github
Could be much more verbose and use bodies in commit messages"

"Excellent work! I loved that you pushed yourself, and challenged/supported me while I was pushing myself. Your communication was really good and helpful too. I felt like we were both always clear about expectations, shortcomings, and goals, and it resulted in a really great project! I especially appreciated that you let me drive with stuff I was unsure about, and helped me to understand. I actually can't come up with any coaching for you, and I hope we get to work together in the future!"

## D: Professional Skills

Turing's focus on the development aspect of things (both professionally and personally) is something I align with very strongly. Prior to Turing, I had very recently undergone sort of an existence reframing, changing the way I viewed a large number of things. This entailed a lot of inner reflection, much like what we are asked to do here. This led to what I felt where productive gear up and professional development sessions. 

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset is something I am absolutely fascinated with. As reflected in my lightning talk, the human brain is capable of some really incredible things. But only when we allow it to be, focusing on the potential for growth rather than the potentially stagnant nature of things.

#### (Cohort Vision)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown)

We were told many times by other cohorts, and reflected within our own atmosphere, that there was something special about our group. It truly was and continues to be a safe space that fosters growth and acceptance amongst every individual in the class. It was profound to be a part of that and I look forward to watching it grow.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Something that bodybuilding taught me is that suffering is a skill. Being able to just grit your teeth, handle your shit, and keep working is what is going to allow us to develop a true growth mindset. Focusing on the ability to improve through the things that are most difficult enables us to become the best possible version of ourselves.  

#### (Intro/extro/ambivert personalities)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

Prior to turing, I had really shut myself off from society as a whole. I had forced myself to try and become introverted, cutting myself off from things and people I had loved. This gear up was really important to me, because it reinforced that I really was was an extrovert, and if I truly wanted to be the best version of myself, I needed to accept that and open myself up.

#### (Personal Story)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

Telling my story is something I have gotten quite good at. After moving so many times growing up, I was forced to be comfortable recapping my existence. Tailoring that story towards allowing others to be more comfortable with telling their own is now my goal. The more we can open up and share our lives with others, the faster we can all grow.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This movie was awesome. That about covers it. What was particularly powerful was when my project partner at the time, Amy, spoke up about a gender equality scenario that Ricardo and I had unknowingly created for her. It was incredibly powerful to learn that we indirectly played a role in perpetuating this situation, and forced us to really examine how we can make a difference.


#### (Don't Take Yourself too Seriously)

I am the king of taking myself too seriously. In just about everywhere imaginable. Receiving a platform to discuss that openly with others was incredibly powerful and even healing. It is something I am actively working towards improving, and knowing others struggle as well is empowering.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

First and foremost, the feedback I received on my lightning talk was overwhelming. Even yesterday, one of the BE Mod1 students came up to me to tell me that he had radically altered how he spoke to himself as a result of the talk I gave. Additionally, towards the end I really felt more comfortable stepping in to help others that weren't as comfortable with material, especially on mythical creatures. That said, I really didn't participate in anything outside of school hours. So much of the social gatherings that take place are alcohol centric, which doesn't fit into my lifestyle at all so I opt out. Something to work on in the future mods is going to these events anyway, even if I don't actively participate. Additionally, continuing to offer to help in anyway that I can on course material that I am comfortable with.
