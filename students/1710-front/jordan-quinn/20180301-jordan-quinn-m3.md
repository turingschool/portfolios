# Jordan Quinn - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I really really wanted to push my JavaScript skills, focusing on the refactoring process and creating extremely clean code. Beyond that, I wanted to build projects I could be very proud of, that were well tested, and technically challenging. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we dove headfirst into React, Redux, and all of the testing. My only individual project, SWAPI-Box, was an excellent exercise in most of these endeavors. This was probably my favorite project of the module, even though it was a source of a lot of sadness and difficulty.

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

An opportunity to sift through a deeply nested API of a Galaxy far, far away and create a Jedi and Sith themed UX/UI for said data.

##### Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

##### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

##### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

##### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects this mod were awesome, I got to work with Amy twice which is always a good time, and the experience of working in a group of three for the first time was a fun and unique challenge.

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

An exercise in leveraging the data down actions up flow of React and cleaning data from a large data pool.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Our first group project with a focus in React, Redux, and Router. 

##### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

- 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### CSS/Design

- 4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

##### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

##### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense.

#### Personal Projects (Roastr)

This project presented a number of challenges. Learning how to manage email security to enhance deliverability, building our first express server, working with a real life client, getting soul crushing feedback on our testing that ultimately made us way better at testing, and life deciding to explode in my face for about two weeks straight during the project. Though for a long time I remained resistant to the idea of being proud of this project (as it was not technically challenging enough for the standards I have set for myself), looking back I am very proud for us learning so many new things, and overcoming so much.

##### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### Testing

- 3+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## D: Professional Skills

I was really proud of myself in regards to this. My resume was reviewed 4 times by Ian before we ever got to the official resume review, and I think that made me a stronger candidate for employment at many of the positions I am reaching out to. I feel that I did well in my first interview, and have my follow up interview with their software director today. I adhered fairly rigorously (I would say 4-5 days a week) of Jeff's rule to spend 30 minutes to an hour on PD everyday. 

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### MicroAggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This was a challenging gear up for me, having always been from the camp that it isn't somebody else's responsibility if you choose to feel a certain way about how they behave. While I still feel this way, I also realize that, for many people, microaggressions are a very real part of their daily existence and I even discovered a few that have been directed twoards me over the course of my life. 

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was the first Gear Up I participated in that I genuinely felt was executed poorly. There was very little discussion that was had, and that which was had was unusually hostile and ill intended. What I came away from this learning is that the people with the most internal biases are usually the last people to realize it.

#### Ethics in A.I

* They didn't post the URL

I absolutely love this topic. We went down some pretty deep philosophical rabbit holes, and definitely got a little bit creeped out in the process. The theoretical nature of so much of this discussion was a great time to be a part of.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I think, as a whole, the larger Turing Community supported me this mod. I had been fairly on my own for most of mod1 and mod2, leaning on outside resources for support. But when those resources temporarily crumbled, my fellow cohort mates supported me in ways I couldn't have imagined. I've found some of the most incredible friends, mentors, and human beings out of my experience in this module and I am incredibly appreciative of them.
