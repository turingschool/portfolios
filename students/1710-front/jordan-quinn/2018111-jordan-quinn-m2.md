# Jordan Quinn - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod was a wonderful time. I personally emphasized my development of a clean coding style, wrapping my head around JavaScript fundamentals, and the wickedness that is React. I felt my growth as a developer was 10 fold over what it was from beginning to end of Mod1, and am excited to see that progression (hopefully) continue through Mods 3 and 4. I also began participating in some more professionally focused endeavors, such as networking with recruiters and writing technical blogs. These are things I will expand upon in future mods and in the workforce. More than anything, I want to focus on learning how to best teach and impart knowledge to my peers and lower mods to develop them and my skillset as a consultant in the future.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

The end of module assessment was something I was actually immensely proud of. I think start to finish was about 16 minutes, and I felt very comfortable the entire way through. It also proved to me I am developing in my pairing skills, as I felt I was able to immediately take the feedback/suggestions from Leta and run with it. In mod1, I sometimes struggled to ask for or accept help. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, our individual projects were sorting-suite and complete-me. Though widely despised by my classmates, these were the best projects ever. Data structures and true computer science are things I am absolutely enamored with, so these were so much fun for me. I look forward to expanding upon these concepts in the future.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/sortingSuite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project, we were tasked with learning the ins and outs of the four most common sorting algorithms. I felt this project was some of the strongest collaboration we had experienced as a mod; it was definitely a strong point for collaboration personally. Tackling merge and quick sort were brain-bending at times, but at the end of it I felt my understanding of recursion as a whole improved as well as my logic towards solving problems like this.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project we built out an auto-complete function by utilizing a prefix-trie. This data structure differs only slightly from the binary tree in that it isn't restricted to a left and right child with specific organization based on the greater/less than value. We then modified this and packaged it up into an npm module so as to be used in our Weatherly projects. I really enjoyed this as it was really the first time a previous project directly contributed to a next step.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The paired projects this mod were GameTime and Weatherly, both designed to "flex" different development muscles. Game time focused almost entirely on javascript logic whereas Weatherly allowed us the freedom to push ourselves in CSS while building our base foundation for React, XML, and server/api interaction.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/frogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project was very challenging. I haven't had my true "turing moment" yet, but this project brought me close at times. Amy was going through a series of personal struggles, which ended up bringing us closer together as a pair and developing our work flow further. Although neither one of us fleshed the game out nearly as much as we would have liked, it was an incredible pairing experience and Amy is one of my closest Turing friends now. I think we both want to go back into the code over this break and the following mods to clean up the code, re-size it to make it more playable/enjoyable, and add functionality. 

### Evaluator: 

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This was by far my favorite project thus far. It involved so many intertwined layers, a deeper dive into real-world functionality, and the freedom to build out the spec how we saw fit. I think this pushed Alex and I towards always going for that next feature or next refactor, which was awesome. React is so powerful, and I truly can't wait to utilize it in further projects.

I felt our scores were in line with what Nathaniel provided us. After our feedback, we went back and added in a couple key chunks of functionality that were suggested to create a final, polished project. All and all, this was a great experience. 

### Evaluator: 

#### Specfication Adherence 

* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### HTML Style 

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](Markdown was not provided to us, we were in slack channel #net-neutrality)

I felt this Gearup was informative and relevant towards our future as developers and consumers. Net neutrality is a complex issue, with proponents on both sides. Although we all have a bit of bias, I felt the group did a good job of examining both sides of the issue, rather than outright condemning one or the other. Many of us continued doing our own research after the fact which I thought was pretty cool.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This was by far my favorite gear up we have had so far. It covered so many concepts of modern society: why we do what we do, why advertisers/companies do what they do, and what that all means. We had an impassioned and intelligent discussion about all aspects of this. I walked away with suggestions on how to free myself from the attention economy that I had not previously considered, and immediately implemented. This has improved my skills as a developer and my focus.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I felt this was a challenging topic for many in the room to discuss. That said, the discussions that were had were fair and intelligent. It's an incredibly sensitive/triggering topic for many, and navigating that space in a way that furthered the discussion without being negligent towards anybody's feellings/experiences on the matter elevated all of us in a way I didn't expect. Getting everybody's perspective on the matter was interesting, as well as being able to provide insight from my side that was the inverse of what people expected. All and all, I felt this gear up was well executed and informative. 



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Every mod I try to do one thing in the community. In mod1, it was my lightning talk which I received lots of positivity towards. In mod2, it was pairing with mod1 students/leading mythical creature sessions. I'm not one for the big nights out or much of the more "social" aspects of Turing, but when it comes to helping develop others and participating in that regard, I'm all in.
