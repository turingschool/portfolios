## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_
_This inning I was strickly focused on array prototypes and Objects, Going through a second time has given me the confidence about when and how to use them. Commication has been one of my weaknesses but I believe I have grown in this area alot this much. Keeping my instructors updated with my schedule and also reaching out to instructors, staff members and mentors is something I'm no longer afraid of doing._
