## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

	Repeating Module 1 has given me the opportunity to hone down on some foundational front end skills as well as solidify concepts and methods that came to me as a blur last mod. i.e. CSS complex javaScript, and localStorage. In addition, I set out to gain more confidence in my ideas and approaches to problem solving.

 DOM Munipulation: Passed;
 Mythical Creatures: Retaking with Pam;
 Static Comp: Pending;

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Number Guesser: Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

Static-comps: The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. I was asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, I was be given a static comp and asked to recreate it.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Linked List: With a little jQuery under your belt, it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

Idea Box: We built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

2Do Box: We inherited someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox by refactoring their code.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
+(Growth Mindset)- Through this gear-up I was able to gage a better understanding of growth mindset and recognize moments when I go into a fixed mindset and how to bring myself out of that environment. I like the qoute "Be a Alchemist"- turning terribble problems into gold. I've also learned to let my mental compacity focus on one thing at a time, and to trust the ciriculum here at Turing.
 
 (Getting Better at Difficult Things) - Congnitive processing is all the same tank "congnitive resources, if you burn one you burn the other". To be able to utilize you thought process you have to make sure you are not wasting or depleting your energy on unneccessary things - Using your brain to think.
 
 (Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts) - I've always considered myself to be more of an extrovert but today solidiefied the parts of me that are introverted. And that leads me to another thing Ambivert and the spectrum of their emotion. No-one is truly one extreme we all fall somewhere on the spectrum. It was also nice to identify with our strngths and weaknesses and see how to can benefit from them by possesing them through our day-to day activity.'
 
 (Code: Debugging the Gender Gap) - I really enjoyed watching this movie and expanding my awareness even more on the truths and realities of the tech industry. A programmer named Cedric mentioned in the movie "it is important seeing someone you relate to doing the same thing". Misrepresentation is something that I personally am always trying to dismantle. I've seen the error of it's ways and have even been affected by it's actions. I also have already been aware of the lack of women hired in the workforce but I didn't know the numbers were extremely low. A big wak up call. "we have to be impatient about this".'
 
 (Case Study with Mod 4- Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture) - I loved this gear-up topic. Not only do I think the toxic masculinity is idiotic I also think it is important to look at not only the outcomes of masculinity but where is stems from. I believe young men and men are told they are not allowed to experirence Itimacy and affection the same way young women and women do. And I think this ties in and plays a big part into rape culture. 

## E: Community Participation
