## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe that my performance was satisfactory for completion of Module 1.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our individual work consisted of one project (Number Guesser) and several assignments that were recreations of static compositions. The project required combining what we learned about HTML/CSS and Javascript to create a functional web page. For the static composition assignments we were required to follow the layout of the images but were granted liberties with the copy and colors.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For this project we were to create a random number guessing game. The game would then provide the user with feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The project combined what we learned in Javascript and HTML/CSS.

  ##### Notes/What To Work On:
   - really nicely done
   - very clean, tidy codebase
   - used branches for each phase!!!
   - good job!

  ##### Functional Expectations

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were assigned several paired projects over the course of Module 1. The purpose of each project was to applied concepts learned in class and also how to work with other developers.

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project required us to create a web page which accepted user input and appended the information to the screen. 

  ## Notes/What To Work On:
  - Good error messaging.
  - Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
  - Love the focus returning to input on submission of form.
  - HTML has unnecessary spacing that makes it hard to read.
  - Counter for read cards/total card not intuitive for the user.
  - YAY for ARIA and running it through Chromevox!
  - Be sure to use hex codes and not the color names in CSS - you have a mix of both. Hex code offers support across all browsers.
  - Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
  - It is clear that you both know what each piece of the JS code is doing. Love your passion around digging into Regex.
  - JS could use refactoring - especially displayError function.

  ##### Functional Expectations
  * Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
  * Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

  ##### Feedback from Partner: 
  Ophus was a fantastic partner to have, especially for our first project together. Immediately we sat down and went one by one down the DTR and quickly found out that both of us have similar work ethic and drive to complete projects. It was nice to have that right off the bat. Ophus has a great attitude and was willing to get down to business but also laugh at silly mistakes and a good observer of poms. Ophus was quite able to navigate Chrome dev tools but I think he could take a step in console.logging and debuggering more to find where his bugs are located and also willing to try things that might not work the first time, just in order to take steps towards a working function. By the end of the project Ophus was taking his work ethic to the max by using RegEx and i really appreciated that he took that on. Next he'll have to teach me it all.

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project built on the foundations established in Linked List. The web page accepted user input and appended it visually to the screen. The user information also needed to persist through page reload so concepts regarding local storage on a machine were applied to achieve this outcome.

  ###### HTML:
  * Appreciate the attempt at making the site screen reader accessible, however using tabindex everywhere is not necessary or sustainable
  * Work on proper indentation ie body should be tabbed in one from the html tags
  * Comments are redundant
  * Work on consistent casing and ideally have it be kabob-case

  ###### CSS:
  * Work on indentation and spacing in css
  * Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
  * Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces 
  * Make sure comments are correctly placed and consistent for organization

  ###### JS:
  * Work on passing objects instead of object properties
  * Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card 
  * Work on more consistent spacing and indentation(no need for blank lines in functions)
  * Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
  * Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments


  ##### Functional Expectations:
  * Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
  * Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

  ##### HTML
  ###### Accessibility:
  * Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

  ###### Style:
  * Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

  ##### CSS
  ###### Structure of Code:
  * Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
  * Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

  ###### Implementation:
  * Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

  ##### JAVASCRIPT
  ###### Data Types:
  * Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
  * Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

  ###### Conditional Logic:
  * Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
  * Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

  ###### Functions & Scope:
  * Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
  * Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

  ###### Arrays:
  * Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

  ###### Objects & Prototypes:
  * Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
  * Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

  ###### DOM Manipulation:
  * Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
  * Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

  ###### Style
  * Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

  ##### GIT & GITHUB
  ###### Git:
  * Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

  ###### Github:
  * Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
  * Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

  ##### DESIGN
  ###### Comp Recreation:
  * Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


  ##### PAIRING
  ###### Collaboration:
  * Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

  ##### Feedback from Partner:
  Ophus is a great paring partner. More specifically, his enthusiasm for whatever we're doing is infectious. While he might be completely exhausted or burnt out mentally, he never hinted at giving up. Tenacious would be an understatement. He's got a solid grasp of javascript and is willing to jump into any problem you're working on. As for coaching, the one big thing I would suggest to him is to stop falling in love with a possible solution. Be more willing to delete the code you're stuck on and start over. He sometimes would fight with code for several hours, despite not making any notable progress. After having finally scrapped that idea and restarting from the beginning, things tended to go much more smoothly. Also, use more console.logs to debug. He seemed to want to debug programs all in his head, without resorting to simple console.logs. While impressive if he managed to succeed, it often seemed to slow down his path to a solution. Outside of that, I'm jealous of his organizational skills and ability to quickly prioritize work. His eye for and attention to detail is equally admirable. He'll make a great partner for anyone.



#### (2DoBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project required us to refactor another person's code base from a previous project and then incorporate additional functionality.

  ##### Notes/What To Work On:
  - overwhelmed by working within an existing codebase, struggled to track logic and thought process of original developer's code.
  - focused on refactoring JS, no new functionality. JS still had opportunities for refactoring and clean up.
  - didn't add any additional functionality, not all Ideabox functionality is solid (filter is case sensitive and hitting `enter` to leave an input isn't hooked up)
  - localStorage broken on Ophus's machine, unclear what is going on, works on Kailin's (different branches locally?)
  - lots of buggy behavior: first time upvote hits "critical" it becomes "undefined" on page load, and returns to "critical" after refreshing the page.
  - CSS has a lot of opportunities for further refactoring, many unused properties and cruft. Make sure you are keeping in mind foundational CSS rules and box-model as you write CSS. Much of what is written in this codebase is either doing nothing (ie `display: block` on elements that are block by default (like a div, for example) or using `margin: auto` on elements that also have `display: inline-block` on them) or overriding properties in the same rule.
  - I expected more progress to be made on this project, although it does seem like both team members learned a lot from the process of fighting with this code base, which is fantastic. Learning is always the #1 goal. It is unclear if it was a time management problem or if what was asked of them was overwhelming and the team didn't feel comfortable reaching out for help to get unstuck.

## D: Professional Skills
Throughout Module 1 we also participated in Gear Up sessions which emphasized professional growth as developers. These sessions ranged from discussing the gender gap present in the industry to more introspective topics, such as dealing with failure.

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I really enjoyed this session as it helped slowly introduce us to the concepts necessary to grow and learn as adults. This session resonated with me for a number of reasons but I felt that the use of "yet" was extremely important to retain in the back of my mind as we worked through Module 1.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I felt this session was extremely valuable as one of our early Gear Ups as this helped to provide some insight into our learning behaviors and improving as developers. The idea of cognitive load fascinated me and I have certainly found myself applying it more often so that I am able to stay motivated when working through difficult challenges. I also realized that applying emotion to learning is incredibly important as this helps to eliminate distractions and enable one to focus more fully on the material at hand.

#### (Intro, Extro, Ambivert Styles)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This session served to illuminate us further on the discussion surrounding intro/extro/ambiverts and how none of us are purely introverted or extroverted. I found this fascinating and very important to my own personal growth as many personality assessments which I have taken placed me in the introverted category despite personal friends pointing to many experiences and saying they feel I am extroverted. After the session, I am more aware that I have tendencies of both personality types and can leverage these in many different situations. 

#### (Personal Stories)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This session focused on how we crafted our personal stories - which is important in a personal and professional aspect. From a personal aspect, I feel that this helped to cement what areas we value or emphasize most in our lives. In the professional realm, I felt that this helped us to better craft our narrative when discussing with future employers our story in a more succint manner. This was extremely beneficial for me as I have experienced a lot of change in my own life the past year, so practicing this has helped me to focus on areas which I feel are relevant to my growth and the discussion in which I am engaged.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This session focused on the gender gap currently plaguing the tech industry. We watched a brief documentary which presented a ton of new information and helped me to view things from different perspective, especially regarding previous behaviors I may have exhibited towards women in my life which I had no idea was perpetuating this problem. I also found that much of what we discussed is also extremely valid for applying to other discussions regarding diversity.

#### (Rule Number 6 - Don't Take Yourself So Seriously)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1710-inning/group_two.md)

This session was led by Module 4 students and focused on not taking ourselves so seriously. More specifically, the session emphasized understanding one's current situation by taking a step back to get a different perspective. I felt that this session was important as it's easy for me to get tunnel vision when I focus on a goal. In the past, this has led to deterioration in my personal health and relationships with friends, family, and significant others. Moving forward after the session, I have ways to step away from my current situation, appreciate those around me, and have a good laugh.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a Module 1 student, I felt that I didn't participate as often as I would have liked in the Turing community given my focus on establishing a strong knowledge base and foundation. I did receive some benefit from sessions hosted by IronFE as well as Module 2 students to help strengthen some of my technical skills. Moving forward, I would like to engage more in the Turing community by helping new students familiarize themselves and also in creating a more inclusive environment that empowers its students to go out in the world and make a difference.
