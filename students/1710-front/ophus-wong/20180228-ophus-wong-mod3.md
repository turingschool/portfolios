## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe that my performance was satisfactory for completion of Module 3.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual assignments completed for this mod were SWAPI Box and a self-directed project. The goal of these projects was to strengthen our understand of React, Redux, Router, asynchronus Javascript, and utlizing API endpoints to present data to users.

### SWAPI-Box

* [SWAPI-Box Repo](https://github.com/OphDub/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

To goal for this project was to build an application utilizing React, Router (optional), and the Star Wars api. The was an  emphasis on modular architecture and asynchronus Javascript.

#### Evaluator: Will
#### Comments: Excellent project, focus more on UI in the future

#### Rubric

#### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

#### CSS/Design

3- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

#### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

### Self-Directed Project: FitFriends

* [FitFriends Repo](https://github.com/OphDub/FitFriends)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal I set for this project was to build a platform for multiple users to share workouts with one another. This project utilized React, Router, Redux, Thunk, and Firebase.

## D: Professional Skills

#### Microaggressions

* [Microaggressions Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

I found this session to be valuable as it helped me reflect internally and strengthen my use of inclusive language. This session also helped to point out a blind spot to me that microaggressions also include non-verbal cues from body language and behavior as well. As someone who is typically non-confrontational, this gear up also helped me to practice speaking up when non-inclusive situations occur.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Tragedy of the Commons Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Coming from a collegiate institution which focused heavily on discussions and initiatives to advance diversity and inclusion, it had never occurred to me that technology (specifically software development) could be used to strengthen and broaden the message. I believe that issue of institution oppression can sometimes be difficult for everyone to understand at first pass, so I felt that this session effectively presented the situation along with perspectives which may not usually be considered when more polarizing factors (e.g. race) are brought into the discussion.

#### Ethics in AI

* [Ethics in AI Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/Group_1.md)

This gear up focused on issues surrounding AI as it emerges as one of the hottest topics in the tech industry. Our discussions covered topics from human dignity, security/privacy, and the impact of automation on labor. I found all of these to be very engaging, particularly the discussion of automation as it involves understanding the social implications presented when technology begins to eliminate positions previously held by humans. As developers, I think it will be important for us to lead the way with these discussion and ensuring that those displaced by the applications we create are also given consideration for their future.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I participated in a few community events but not as many as I would have liked. I engaged with a number of Mod 1 and Mod 2 students in pairing sessions to help in areas where they were struggling. For the next module, I would like to continue to engage more with students from other modules and help them on their journey through Turing.
