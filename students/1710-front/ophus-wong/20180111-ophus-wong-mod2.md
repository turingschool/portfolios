-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe that my performance was satisfactory for completion of Module 2.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects completed for this mod were Sorting-Suite, Complete-Me, and a static comp utilizing React. The goal of these projects was to introduce us to fundamental computer science fundamentals and the React framework.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

To goal for this project was to implement the following sorting algorithms:
* Bubble
* Insertion
* Merge
* Quick

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

The goal of complete me was to create a pre-fix trie and also to package it as a npm module for use in the group project Weathrly

## React Static Comp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/ow-react-static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-starter-kit/blob/react-static-comp/README.md)

Objective of this project is to learn React and utilize it to create a static composition which mimicked the popular online publishing platform, [Medium](https://www.medium.com).

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects for this module were GameTime and Weathrly. The primary focus of these projects was to strengthen our understand of objects and introduce us to React.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

The focus of this project was to strengthen our understanding of objects, passing information between objects, and object-oriented programming. This was accomplished by utilizing HTML canvas to render each object visually. We chose to re-create the arcade game, Centipede. 

#### Instructor: Leta
#### Comments:
- Great work refactoring the DOM references out of Game.js!
- Testing suite is very solid

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3+ - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing
* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

#### JavaScript Style
* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 3+ - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Partner Feedback

I had a great experience pairing with my project partner, Amanda. Our feedback conversations were private and I feel they were very productive in relation to the project.


## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Primary goal for this project was to learn the React framework and further strengthening our knowledge of OOP. This was achived by creating a functional weather application that received data from a Weather Underground API.

### Instructor: Nathaniel
#### Comments: TBD

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application has less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style
TBD

#### JavaScript / React Style
TBD

#### Testing
TBD

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
TBD


#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4): Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_6.md)

This gearup focused on discussions of the ethical implications surrounding user privacy and how our choices as developers can affect these situations. Much of the small group and classroom discussion was framed in the context following the recent San Bernadino attacks where the FBI requested Apple to create version of iOS that would allow access to a device recovered from one of the attackers. I found this gearup extremely engaging as pre-Turing I would have sided with the FB, but as I've gone through the front-end program, my opinion has definitely changed to side with Apple and maintaining client privacy. I think weighing these types of decisions will be some of the most difficult choices I will have to make as a developer.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This gearup centered around attention as a resource that we must value for ourselves and our users. We also discussed responsiblity of spending time wisely and how choices a developer makes can impact a user in various ways. This gearup definitely challenged how I spent my time and which applications I focused on using the most. As a developer, this has helped to shape my perspective in coding to not only providing useful, but efficient and intuitive interfaces. As a result of this session, I have also made it a point to track the amount of time I spend on a mobile device and determining if the applications used are helpful or harmful.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gearup specifically asked us to examine the priviledge each of us and how we can utilize that to empathize with other individuals. I found this gear up to extremely important for our cohort as a group as it helped many of us to uncover unconscious biases or actions based on our or other's priviledges. The session was one of the more vulnerable sessions as I learned many personal things about my peers that I would not have thought to ask about before in day to day conversation. This was one of my favorite sesions. 



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I participated in a number of community events including the winter festival and code fair. I also engaged with some of the Mod 1 students with pairing sessions and just helping them out in general. As a memeber of the community, I felt that I have stepped up from the last mod and would like to continue my progression in creating an inclusive environment at Turing where everyone feels welcome and encouraged.
