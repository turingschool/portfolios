## A: End of Module Assessment

pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects include SWAPI Box and Village Calendar.

#### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/SwapiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project uses the Star Wars API to load Star Wars people, planets, and character data. The scrolling text movie description that is randomly selected on refresh is displayed. A user can select the type of Star Wars information they would like to see and cards with that information is rendered to the page.

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Village Calendar

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/Village-Calendar)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Village Calendar is my Mod 3 personal project. It is a calendar app that uses the Google Calendar API firebase OAUTH. A user logs in with their google login. They can create a new calendar and give friends access to the calendar or they can load an existing calendar. They can manage their calendar by adding, editing, or deleting events.  

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects completed this mod are HeadCount2.0 and MovieTracker.

#### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This project uses educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. React was used to create modular and reusable components. The district data can be searched by district and also compared to another district.

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

- 3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## Surprise and Delight

- 1 - Magic

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project uses the Movie DB API to see current release movies. The user can login and favorite movies.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This session helped highlight the types of microagressions that we encounter every day. It opened my eyes to the microagressions I see every day on tv, in the media, on social media and even the words that I use regularly. It is really difficult to re-train yourself to speak differently than you are used to speaking. The biggest example of this is refering to people as 'you guys'. My biggest takeaway from this session is that I can try to make changes to my behavior and be open to discussions about microagressions to listen, understand, and correct myself or educate others.  

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

My biggest takeaway from this session is that diversity is good for everyone. We should all try to diversify our lives by engaging with lots of people that are different than us. In a work environment, we should try to attract and advocate for a more diverse group. As a minority, this is especially touchy because no POC wants to feel or be made to feel that they were ONLY hired because they are a POC or woman. 

#### YOUR SPECIFIC MOD 4-LED GEAR UP GOES HERE && FOLLOW & CHANGE URL BELOW

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/tree/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning)

Relaxation in Practice - In this session we discussed stress and relaxation in practice. Most people know what they need to do to manage stress and help relax but sometimes, especially at Turing, time management is an issue. I learned that there are some stress management tools I am already using but I was reminded how I need to include more physical activity in my daily schedule. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was co-leader of the Easley posse. I co-lead and organized 2 Iron-Fe sessions. I also co-lead a Joan Clarke Society pairing session.
