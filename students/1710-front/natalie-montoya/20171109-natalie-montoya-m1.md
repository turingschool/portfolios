# Natalie Montoya - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn javascript, jquery, and improve my html and css skills. This mod is the begining of my path to becoming a front end developer. I have enjoyed all of the projects and I feel like I'm in the right place.

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a number guesser where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

(evaluation comments)

Pretty solid recreation/design of the comp - very minor details to make it pixel perfect
Be mindful of making information/directions digestable for the user. The less they have to think, the better!
Works towards eliminating redundancy in CSS. Use shorthand when applicable
JS is easy to follow. Could use a refactor pass for longer functions

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Build an application that allows the user to create multiple bookmarks for websites to read later. 

(evaluation comments)

comp
Consider mobile first in the future and definitely use the phone simulator to check mobile
Make sure that the placeholder text is lighter than the value text

html
Good use of labels in html
Html needs better use of indentation and a form instead of a section

css
Using vw for height, margin and padding properties felt strange to me - probably better to use rem, em, px or %

js
Avoid unused global variables(ie. cardCountValue is never used)
Work on spacing consistency in js - there should be spaces in between if and (

git/github
liked that there were a lot of commit messages, however in the future try to have them tell more of a story

Natalie did a great time organizing the project and kept the project on spec with the levels we needed to complete. She was able to view the whole picture of the project and break it down into small bite size chunks to help make it feel more manageable. She was easy to work with and when we came to a problem after we tried it for a while was able to reach out to fellow classmates and mod-2 to see if they could help give us a second pair of eyes. We paired for most of the project which I think was really helpful with working with javascript and some of the other features we needed both heads on to help solve the problem. I think that it was a effective way to handle the project and make it so we both contributed to the project. I would say next time we would not need to pair for the style and html parts of the project, to help move  at a faster pace in the easier elements, but overall I thought we worked really well together and I am happy with the outcome. 

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Build an application that can create, store and modify ideas input by the user.

(evaluation comments)

Majority of functionality met!!! Everything persisting as should. However, can create blank cards with no title/body.
Stays true to the spirit of the comp. Drop heavy border around inputs. No indication visually of when the submit button is disabled.
Good amound of commits
Nice organization in CSS.
Nice indentation in HTML file. Good use of semantic tags and labels. Could place aria-label directly on element if you don't want anything displayed. Be sure to add lang attribute to HTML.
Opportunities for refactoring in JScode - Lines 1-3 should have variables declared with $. Naming is confusing at times and hard to follow. Unnecessary arguments being passed in on Line 36. Making instances of same object in lines 39 and 45. createCardObject should take whole object - not individual parameters. Really long event listeners that could use refactoring.


(evaluation scores)

Functional Expectations
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML

Accessibility
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS
Structure of Code
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

GitHub
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING

Collaboration
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

(Feedback)

Natalie is an amazing developer and did a great job on the project. I learned a lot from her and appreciate the effort she put into our project. Natalie did the heavy lifting on the JSON part for the project and did a wonderful job. Here are a few suggestions that could have made our project more successful. - Take the time to understand and develop suggestions with your partner. We could have tried multiple solutions for instance using strings and a conditional in the quality. It would have also helped my confidence to try it the other way. If we had tried both possible solutions we could have come to a better solution faster. -We could have looped each other in more when we ran into issues, together we could have tried to find a solution. for instance, on Thursday we were sitting next to each other while you were working on the search function and you said I need help and picked up your computer and left for help. It would have been great you turned to me. Then if I couldn't help we could go get help together so that I could have learned from the effort as well. Next time we work together, I feel that we can be a strong team. I think that I would be open to discussing any of these items further if necessary.

#### 2DoBox

Refactor and pivot another groups ideaBox project to create, store, and modify tasks instead of ideas.

(evaluation comments)

UI needs a refining around new features
CSS has opportunities for further refactoring
JS has opportunities for further refactoring -- some repetitive functions
worked well together! hit sticky spots but worked hard to understand how to fix it, paired with others, and worked to find solutions as a team
team seemed uncomfortable/hesitant with refactoring. When tightening up one function, if it broke something else, they would revert back to the original function and abandon the refactor. This was said many times during our eval. That's ok! Comfort with refactoring takes time: keep at it, try to not worry when thing break, and don't give up -- that process is part of refactoring a codebase in this way. It can absolutely be frustrating, but it is also a very real part of working in an existing codebase.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

Growth Mindset - This gear up is helpful in recongnizing the difference between fixed and growth mindset. Identifying areas where you may have a fixed mindset and making an effort to move toward a growth mindset really helps with your learning growth.

Getting Better at Difficult Things - I enjoyed the ted talk and seeing positive examples of how growth mindset affects learning. I also thought it was really helpful to see that learning something can be absorbed by observation. The fact that our brains can use pattern recognition to learn something is really amazing.

Extrovert/Introvert Session - This helped me understand myself better being that I'm an ambivert. I think I need to better at recognizing my needs and being kind to myself. This also helped me better understand others and their needs as extroverts/introverts.

Personal Story - This session was a little difficult because it required a lot of self reflection. I think this self reflection is super helpful but also very personal. There group sharing was great and I felt like I got to know the people in my group a lot better.

Debugging the Gender Gap - I think this session is important because we have to talk about issues in order to make changes. There is a very damaging impression that brogramming is the tech culture. It's so important that we educate people about the gender gap issue and implement change when we can.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a mod 1 student I don't think I contributed to the community as much as I would have liked. I paired a lot with the mod 2 students and with some of my classmates. I would like to offer more pairing help to those that need it in the future. I would also like to help with try Turing weekend and/or kids who code in the future.
