# Natalie Montoya - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I loved game time. I wanted to build a great game. At the beginning of mod 2 I realized that I needed to put some extra effort into studying. From the beginning I started to stay after school until about 8pm to work on projects and study. My hard work really paid off and I think I did really with array prototypes and all of the project work.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed - I did well on the assessment but it would be nice if the assessment topics could somehow be incorporated into the project work to give us some more experience.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Evaluator: Leta Keane

#### Sorting-Suite 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project we had to impletment four sorting algorithms. We had to be able to live code, and verbally explain all of the algorithms. I passed this project.

#### Evaluator: Leta Keane

#### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/Complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project we had to build a binary search tree. We had to be able to live code, and verbally explain the tree. I passed this project.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

...The group projects this mod were GameTime and Weathrly...

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project was so much fun. I had a great partner and learning to use canvas was fun. The biggest challenges of this project were collision detection.

### Evaluator: Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectation

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints

### Evaluator: Leta and Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectations

* // need TenDay and SevenHour component 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### User Interface

* // would be nice to be able to type in lowercase city names 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### Testing

* // don't like the br 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/SASS

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

* // dont use document.query 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach to design and component architecture.

#### Testing

* // need some simulate tests 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* The output from a code sanitizer ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints

3 - Five or fewer complaints

2 - Six to ten complaints

1 - More than ten complaints



#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_1.md)

This was an interesting gear up. I didn't really understand what net neutrality meant and now I have a much better understanding of what it is, what it means, and why it is an issue. Even though it was only put into place in 2015, that is light years in tech time. I would be really surprised if there aren't some major instances of abuse in the near future. Net neutrality provided a safety. It will be interesting to see how this effects internet users, use, tech start ups and developers.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This was a great gear up that really demonstrated the attention economy. The attention economy has had a huge impact on society. A perfect example of this is the news industry. Headlines are more important than actual story content because it's more important to get attention than to fact check a story. The attention economy is also very distracting and everyone can relate to opening your phone to check an email only to end up looking at a cute puppy meme on facebook 30 minutes later.

#### Empathy and Privilige

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gear up was very insightful. There are a lot instances of privilige that I never even considered. I had a very interesting converstion with my group. We discussed several defining instances of privilage each of us experienced. We also came up with some good questions to add such as: Have you every experienced a time in the past or currently where you weren't sure where you were going to sleep, what you were going to eat or couldn't meet you basic living needs?

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in Joan Clark Society and I was a posse co-lead. In my posse I worked with my posse-mates to set up a mentor panel. I also participated in some Iron FE.
