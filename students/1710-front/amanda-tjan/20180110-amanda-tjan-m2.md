# Amanda Tjan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus of this mod was to really start to understand other people's code and to really master array prototypes. Also since the focus of this mod was more the logic of computer science, I wanted to finish the mod with a better understanding of fundamental algorithms.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In Mod 2, we had two individual projects: Sorting Suite and Complete Me. Both these projects were focused on learning basic computer science concepts/algorithms.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project, we had to implement four fundamental sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insert sort, quick sort, merge sort.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project, we had to build out a `trie` data structure. My Complete Me project includes an insert method, suggest method, and autocomplete.

## React Static Comp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/at-react-static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-starter-kit/blob/react-static-comp/README.md)

This React static comp was my first experience building a website out with react. We were given all the assets and a basic set up of the JavaScript and CSS files. Then from there we were tasked with writing JSX, passing props, and writing some CSS. We were also in charge of putting in the proper breakpoints so that the comp would be fully responsive and could go from desktop all the way to mobile.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were Game Time and Weathrly. They were both 2 week projects. 

## GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project was all about working with HTML canvas and using JavaScript to interact with it. I did this project with Ophus and we chose to build Centipede. So we had to build out a centipde AI and work with a lot of collision detection. Also, Ophus and I had a basically perfect pairing #ophanda

### Evaluator: Leta

#### Comments:
- Great work refactoring the DOM references out of Game.js!
- Testing suite is very solid

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3+ - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing
* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

#### JavaScript Style
* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 3+ - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

For this project, I worked with Jeff Goodall to build and design a weather app. This was our first time working with a web-api, ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

### Evaluator: Leta

#### Specification Adherence

score: 3++

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


#### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


#### CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


#### JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.


#### Testing

score: 3++

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


#### Workflow

score: 3++

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Gear Up

#### Technology in the Media (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_5.md)

We had an interesting discussion on buzzwords and how technology can affect how we as human beings receive media. There was a lot of talk about what is 'Fake News' and also how buzzwords can affect our perception of certain subject. Also it was interesting to see how social media has affected how we perceive the world. 

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

Attention is the new currency. In this Gear Up, we had a lot of interesting perceptions on how grabbing people's attention is the new way to run a business. The more followers you have, the better and the more success potential your app/company has. And us, as users, are completely addicted to the web. 

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I felt like this was a good gear up in general because it gave us the opportunity to talk about difficult things. I was able to gain a lot of perspective on what other people's experiences were like and even how sometimes our society sets up preconceived judgments not just for women and minorites, but also for white males. I ended up sharing my experiences both as a woman and as a minority in my group, and I felt like I was heard and that my comments gave people in my group some things to think about. There were certain statements that really resonated with me, like the fact that my ancestral history isn't taught in schools. And I shared my experience of wanting to be white when I was younger. I think that those statements might not have been ones that other people in my group had thought about as much.
