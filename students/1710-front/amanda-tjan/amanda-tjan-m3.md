-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we had to work on two projects individually: SWAPI Box and our personal project. Although it was difficult to work on such large scale projects alone, these projects gave me the opportunity to really see how far I could push myself technically without worrying about all the nuances that come with working with other people. 

#### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we were given 1 week to complete an application that pulled data from the Star Wars API and built out React components.

#### Evaluation Comments and Scores

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints


#### The Know

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/the-know)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The Know is an application where a user can search through upcoming events using their current location or entering a city of their choice. The user can filter events by category and when they are taking place. For this project, I was given two weeks to build out a web application that successfully implemented React.js and a Redux store, fetched data from various API's, and also fully tested the application using Jest and Enzyme.

#### Evaluation Comments and Scores

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
// you can still automate and move things out of the tests to make them mor managable. 
### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod, we had two group projects. The first project Headcount 2.0 was a paired project. The second project Movie Tracker was a group project and I worked with two other people. 

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. I worked on this project with Jeff Goodall. 

#### Evaluation Comments and Scores

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

- 3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.


#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. I worked on this project with James Logue and Jorge Ed PerezGa. 

#### Evaluation Comments and Scores

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

I think that this session of microagressions made a lot of people in the class realize that we all make microagressions. Even those of us who are 'woke' and trying to make a conscious effort to not do microaggressions slip up sometimes. I think that this is important and we have to be gentle with ourselves yet take responsibility for the way that something we said might have affected someone else. 

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was an interesting session that talked about how people subconsciously tend to be drawn towards other people that are like them. We had a lot of great talks about how we can improve diversity in the workplace once we leave Turing. It also made me realize that people have to really make an effort to realize when these sort of things are happening, because sometimes people don't realize that they are intentionally gravititating towards other people that are like them. 

####  Relaxation in Practice

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/tree/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning)

We had a session about ways to relax and things that we can do to prevent reaching our over-stressed limits. As the name implies, it was a relaxing session with good people. This week after the gear up, I actually have tried to restart my yoga and meditation practice again. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In the Turing community, I have been an active member/leader of Joan Clarke Society. This mod I was a lead for two of the meetings. I also led an afternoon session of IronFE. Although posses are in transition, I worked with the other Mod 3ers in Woz Poz to make it a posse that provided cross-mod support for the lower mod students. I've paired weekly with people from lower mods to have study sessions and help them through projects.
