## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

My biggest achievement this module was getting my dream job after Turing. I started the job search during the intermission week after Mod 3 and my goal was to have a job before graduation. I came to Turing with a background in education technology and really didn’t think it would be possible to stay in that field. I’ve accepted a position as a Field Software Engineer at Guild Education and I’ll be a developer who is client facing.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest struggle this module was balancing my time with the job search and projects. I had several final interviews and with each company process came a code challenge/assignment that was a project in itself. Overall every at Turing was really supportive with the focus that I chose. 



## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

This inning, I advanced to the final stages of Turing’s lightning talk exposition. I’m one of 8 talks that was selected. My talk is about getting started with building web-based VR environments using a framework called A-frame. VR, AR, and other similar technologies feel really out of reach for new developers. I wanted to give a talk that empowered my classmates to get started with these nascent technologies and to realize that they had the skills to build beautiful, 3-D graphic interfaces. 

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I really loved the stack this module. I began using the mod 4 lessons with my personal project in mod 3 last module. I built a node express backend and a web socket to handle real time audio transcription in my project last module. Most of that was self taught and with the help of youtube and the Turing resources. So it was really fun to officially dive into these topics and learn more about them this module. Learning how to test a backend, and that testing in the backend is heaven, and learning about more in depth topics like security, JSON web tokens, and web-scraping was a blast. I also feel like it took the technical understanding I have of the front-end to an entirely new level. Overall, I came out of this module with an excitement to keep growing and learning into a strong, full-stack developer.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

There are so many, so it’s hard to pick one. Ultimately thought I think it’s the confidence I now have in myself to learn and teach myself new skills and technologies. Before Turing, I wouldn’t have felt that I could take on any library, much less learned to code at all. I was coming from the technology world, but I wasn’t technical. I always felt like I had snuck into my industry and I was really jealous of the teammates I had who were having the technical conversations. They were not only shaping our company and our products, they were building things that had never existed. Turing has given me the confidence that I’m now part of those conversations and that I have the foundation to keep teaching myself and learning as the industry evolves.
