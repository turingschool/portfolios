# Melissa Wagasky - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I hoped to gain a strong understanding of Javascript, complex data structures, and a new framework - React. I focused on strengthening my understanding of complex and abstract data structures through our work with linked lists, binary trees and prefix tries. I also focused on object oriented programming through game-time. Both of these bodies of work helped to deepen my understanding of Javascript and more complex computer science applications. Finally in the mod, I took my understanding of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript in front-end interfaces and expanded it to include React. Learning this framework and the power of components will help me to create more modular projects in the future with more efficient code. Throughout the mod, I also focused on deepening my understanding of Javascript array prototypes and object methods. I now have a much stronger understanding of how to access data with objects, how to manipulate that data, and how to create the types of data structures - both simple and complex - that I need to build more dynamic and powerful functions and applications with Javascript.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

...the individual projects I completed this Mod were Sorting-Suite, Complete-Me....

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project, I derived algorithms to perform a bubble sort, an insertion sort, a merge sort and a quick sort using Javascript. This project gave me a deeper understanding of javascript and an introduction to sorting algorithms. I used TDD to implement these algorithms and wrote a comprehensive testing suite as the first stage of development.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project, I derived an prefix trie with javascript. The search prefix trie I created can populate a trie with a data set (such as a dictionary) and then return an array of useful suggestions when provided with the root of a word. Finally, I packaged this search trie into an npm module to use in a project later in the mod.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

...The group projects this mod were GameTime and Weathrly...

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For GameTime, we built a brick breaker game using javascript. This was a great jump in object oriented programming.

### Evaluator: Leta

* Partner Feedback: Nyssa and I had a private feedback conversation and gave constructive feedback to each other in person.

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints


## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In Weatherly, we dove right into learning React and rendering components in a javascript application. We implemented the Weather Underground API and made our first API calls. We also learned how to import our own npm module (my complete me) to implement auto-complete functionality for the weather search. 

### Evaluator: Leta

* Partner Feedback: Nora and I had a private feedback conversation and gave constructive feedback to each other in person.


#### Specification Adherence

*  score: 3++

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style

* score: 3++

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### Javascript/ React Style

* score: 3++

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach to design and component architecture.

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills Development

#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* Ethics of Open Souce

In the Ethics of Open Source Gearup, we learned about the differences between permissive licensing and 'copyleft' licensing, MIT and GPL licenses respectively. Restrictive licenses are not open source licenses. We discussed the differences and implications when employing each license and also the ethical implications. We also discussed the different broad philosophies about information ownership - the egalitarian, utilitarian, common good, rights, and virtue perspectives -  and reflected on the frameworks that aligned to our own belief systems around information permissions.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

The Attention Economy gearup focused on understanding and debating the business model of advertising revenue based on user interaction and time spent on an app. As a group we read about examples of this and how impacted us 1) as users and 2) as developers. This was an eye opening conversation and a great chance to reflect about both the good and bad of the attention economy.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

In the Empathy and Privilege gearup, we completed an inventory of our own privilege. After, we discussed examples of privilege an disadvantages that we face in small groups. This discussion was an opportunity to show vulnerability by discussing our own disadvantages and awareness of privileges. This discussion was also an opportunity to build and express empathy for our classmates and to build our awareness about the both visible and invisible disadvantages and privileges faced by our community.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I took a larger role in our community. I led a Joan Clarke Society session getting a mentor and coached several module 1 students to help them find mentors and craft their outreach. I taught a javascript foundations lesson to FE Mod 1 about object oriented programming and understanding constructor functions that connect between files. I got involved with Pahkla and helped to brainstorm an education resource app with students from upper mods and help with user problem definition for a resource app being built in Pahlka. I also paired with students in mod 1 whenever possible during the week. 

Next mod, I'm hope to begin preparing the lightening talk that I plan to give about the 4th amendment and digital privacy advocacy in Mod 4. I'm hoping to take a larger role in Pahlka and to lead a project. I'm also hoping to begin getting involved with building more connections between Turing and the community outside of Turing. I'm planning to attend several meetups to represent Turing and to get involved with open source - both helping open source projects in their documentation and with the open source, Denver Startup Week  platform.
