## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.25
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Looking back on everything I've accomplished thusfar is really encouraging. I feel comfortable with React, Redux, making API calls and testing. Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The Mod3 personal projects consist of SWapi-box, Quick Quote and PokeDex. The Swapi-box project was helpful in reinforcing
React knowledge base and get more experience displaying data from fetch calls. Quick Quote was the first individual Redux
project. PokeDex was an all day coding assessment that focused on React, Redux and calling an API.

#### SWapi-box

* [SWapi-box](https://github.com/j25bender/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A React project that utilizes the Star Wars API. 

* [Eval Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1710/mod-3/swapi/jeff-bender/scores.md)
### Evaluator: Will
### Comments: Nice project, good use of extracted api calls. Do more testing!

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well
refactored code.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations
for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain
irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to
incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain
little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be
.gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need
to be cleaned up.

#### PokeDex

* [PokeDex](https://github.com/j25bender/pokedex)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pokedex)
* [PokeDex API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/poke-api)

Final Assessment that required a working knowledge of actions, reducers and building a redux store.

### Evaluator: Will
Passed

#### Quick Quote

* [Quick Quote](https://github.com/j25bender/quick-quote)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

A web app that utilizes React and Redux to fetch from the TheySaidSo.com API and display quotes from a variety of categories.

* [Eval Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1710/mod-3/personal-projects/JeffBender/rubric.md)
### Evaluator: Will
### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3+: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations
for design changes. Follows majority of the
[10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well
refactored code.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers
don't hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain
irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and
tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application,
and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should
be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects from Mod3 consisted of HeadCount 2.0 and Movie Tracker.

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [HeadCount 2.0](https://github.com/OphDub/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

I partnered with Ophus Wong to complete HeadCount 2.0. This project reinforced our knowledge base of React and dealing with
data fetched from and API.

### Evaluator: Will
## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

- 3- - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations
for design changes. Follows majority of the

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary
application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain
irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to
incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain
little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be
.gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need

## D: Professional Skills
This mod's professional skill developement consisted of Microaggresions, Tragedy of the Commons, Avoiding Burnout and the Flower
Exercise.

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions
* [Microaggressions Gist](https://gist.github.com/j25bender/9e83787b8d040e26a00486b1c1cb05a2)
I found this Gear Up to be eye-opening. This is a subject that doesn't really get a lot of air time and it should. These
seemingly minor offensives reienforce stereotypes and if they go on checked can lead to the major problems. It takes a
conscience to evaluate your own attitudes and even common colloquialisms. I plan to make this shift in understanding permenant.

#### Tragedy of the Commons
* [Tragedy of the Commons Gist](https://gist.github.com/j25bender/427401a6839531b813508ac4d30339e1)
 Parable of the Polygons: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society I find to be a useful tool in highlighting the issue of 
 hiring mostly similar people in relation to the executives. And since the majority of tech executives are white and male
 any one that doesn't fall into that narrow category is at a disadvantage. It was helpful to hear a variety of opinions on the
 subject and how others have experienced this first hand.

#### Mod4 Led Gear Up: Avoiding Burnout
* [Avoiding Burnout Gist](https://gist.github.com/j25bender/ffc029f44f550ef3de97d6a27b31be34)
The mod4 led gear up on avoiding burnout was helpful. My two main take aways from that session was to be able to identify 
what gives you energy and how to recognize the signs of burnout. Stress is not necessarily bad. Good stress helps motivate you 
to complete projects on time. Burnout on the other hand is a negative response to excessive stress. You need to be able to
identify what recharges your energy so when those signs of burnout start creeping in you can take a break. Grinding on and on
ultimately produces poor results compared to the efforts of someone that is managing their stress.

#### Mod4 Led Gear Up: Avoiding Burnout
* [Flower Exercise](https://gist.github.com/j25bender/9f9f1ebab79777b4350327b0a108b81e)
I thought this was a helpful exercise. I've definitely had jobs in the past that checked a number of boxes for me but fell 
drastically short of others. The end result was some form of burnout or disinterest in the daily work. Moving forward I 
plan on taking this exercise into account before joining another company.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always try and make time for my fellow students that just need someone to talk to or assisst them in talking through a problem.

------------------
