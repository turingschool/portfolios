What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Gaining a deeper understanding of the backend. The backend has always been this mysterious, intimidating, unapproachable thing.
But now that I've put in the time to learn about it it is far less mysterious and having gone through mod4 it has given me
a more complete view how the front and backend communicate and interact.

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
The lesson that I struggled with most was understanding web sockets. I learned that when the documentation only confuses more
you must rely on your classmates and instructors to help explain the new material. Oftentimes my stubbornness to take on challenges
is beneficially but occasionally I spend too much being stuck, but I've learned to ask for help early and often in order to keep up.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I have become a mentor to a mod1 student. It has been a rewarding experience to assist someone that is struggling and help them
understand foreign concepts and be there to just let them talk through projects.

How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted
to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I think it made the backend less intimidating. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of building
a backend. It makes databases and APIs less mysterious and I feel like I will be able to communicate more effectively with 
backend developers. It may have also opened the door to possibly becoming more full stack down the road.

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Turing has made me a far better developer than I ever was after working professionally for more than a year. It has also
heightened my awareness to pay / hiring discrepancies as well as the introvert / extrovert bias. 

Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?
I plan on participating in a daily morning standup with Melissa Wagasky.

What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?
The end of May.

What actions will give you the most impact in your search?
I have had the most success meeting possible employers in person. I plan on trying to set up more coffee meetings and attend 
interesting meetups.

What skills would you like to improve or develop?
I'm interested in learning Vue.js and looking into Drupal.

Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?
I need to level up in array prototype methods. I plan on practicing daily with either Code Wars or Exercisms.

Outreach & Networking
3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30.
Nick Switzer at Elevated Third
Sage Soronson at Sovrn
Lynn Maharas at Effective Inc.

3 new meetups or other career networking events
How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? 
The Denver Drupal Meetup - Elevated Third is a Drupal house and I know Nick will be attending. I plan on reviewing a link Nick sent me
DrupalCamp Colorado.

Crash Course: Blockchain & AdTech...WTF? - Two topics I'm interested in learning more about. I have previous Adtech experience
and I'm interested in the affects of blockchain.

TensorFlow DevSummit Viewing Party - GDG Boulder - I'm interested in learning more about machine learning.

Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing
Cover letter writing
Technical interview
Salary negotiations
 
Social Networking
Blogging
Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks
Participating in hackathons or open source projects
Action Step: Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30
Participating in hackathons or open source projects. I was thinking either a hackathan or helping with the Denver Startup Week.

Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad.
I plan on checking in with Spencer Herms to help keep each other on track.

Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them.
I want to avoid slowing down too much and losing my edge. I need to continue to code daily and challenge myself. That's 
why I think the 40 hour work week I've laid out for myself will help keep me on track to landed a job.
