# Jeff Bender - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The second time around for mod2 I set out to focus on data manipulation and React. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel so much more confident than I did at the end of the first time through mod2. I devoted more time to understanding data
manipulation and had a better understanding of each project at the onset. Sitting front row center everyday helped me stay focused and made sure I didn't miss anything. I have a much deeper knowledge base and no longer have that imposter feeling lingering about quite so much.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Sorting-Suite

* [Sorting-Suite](https://github.com/j25bender/tdd)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project we were tasked with Heap Sort. Spencer, Matt A. and I put our heads together to figure out a way to sort an array by assigning parent and children node-like in a complete binary tree. It was a fun challenge and really gave my confidence level a boost to be the main driving force of figuring this out.

## Complete-Me

* [Complete-Me](https://github.com/j25bender/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

After doing Heap Sort the complete-me project made more sense. As did having a better understanding of data structures and data manipulation. The recursive nature of complete-me was challenging but I had an easier time conceptualizing the project as a whole.

## Weathrly

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

My weathrly project came out pretty good for going at it solo. It gave me a confidence boost to get this React project completed by myself. I now have a much better understanding of components, rendering, state and props. Writing tests for state changes and simulating button clicks was challenging but also helped improve my understanding of state and jest tests.

# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

I was initially excited to back to the GameTime project. Over the break I prepared by doing a Lynda.com tutorial on 3D canvas project to stay motivated. It would have been better to be paired with someone from 1710 to better integrate into the group. Or to go solo and explore creating a 3D game. But overall Matt A. and I created a cool looking functional game of Tron and learned a lot in the process that translated well into understanding render in React.

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

The GearUp I attended w/Mod4 was about growth mindset. They did a good job reviewing topics that seem absolutely necessary to attending Turing and being successful in the startup world. They had a nice balance of sharing with the group, a code challenge and a TEDTalk about Grit that I found engaging and relavant. 

#### Attention Economy
* [Attention Economy Gist](https://gist.github.com/j25bender/824bc73c1aa29dd46f6f6f96e75ebba6)
* [GearUp Attention Economy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

I found this GearUp topic to be really intriguing. I listened to the radio interview with Tristan Harris, the so-called “closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”, and had to pause it numerous times to discuss some of his points. Everyone wants to make the next smash hit popular app but we never really stop to ask if the service we provide is beneficial or even determental to ourselves or users. 

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

Empathy is an important quality to have while working with a diverse group and across diffrent departments and especially with clients. I found reflecting on this topic to be beneficial and I'm grateful to joining a community that puts importance on discussing these kinds of topics openly.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I helped other students whenever I could and helped them avoid the many pitfalls I experienced going through mod2 the first time. I encouraged communication on Slack at night to keep my other fellow repeaters motivated.
