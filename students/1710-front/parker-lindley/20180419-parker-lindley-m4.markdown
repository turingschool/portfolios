# What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Coming in to the module I was apprehensive about the backend but knew it was something I was ready to explore. My biggest achievment is not only understanding the basics of backend techs but being able to integrate it with React Native and Firebase for my teams capstone.

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Initially jQuery proved to be the struggle but as the capstone was kicked off I recieved a weeklong indepth code challenge from a company at the same time. The biggest struggle I had was balancing class, the code challenge, and the capstone all at the same time. I compromised with my sleep and had to sacrafice my attentiveness in class becuase I wanted to be a contributing member to the capstone then work on the challenge at home. I learned that I can juggle learning a new technology (React Native) while also working on a seperate project. The context switching was difficult  usually for the first half hour of each project was spent readjusting to the needs and challenges of that project.

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I set out to learn Vue.js over the break and have continued to work on my own personal website in view through out the mod. I'm aware that I'm not the fastest learner but I am able to deeply focus for long amounts of time and put in extensive hours to understand something presented to me. 


# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I struggled a lot before coming to Turing with whether or not I wanted to join the FE or BE program and after recieving input from developer friends decided on the FE. I knew the importance of BE and integrating it with the FE and was looking forward to it yet also aprehensive as it has challenging connotation with it. I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. It impacts what I want to do after Turing by giving me the ability to make actualy applications that are actually usefull rather than just pretty functioning things with local storage. I would still like to work in the FE but knowing that I can at least marginally understand what's happening in the BE gives me confidence.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

...So many. The most important? The ability to effectively work with people? The ability to work through problems, to say what you don't know and ask for help and work through it together. I believe that it's invaluable.
