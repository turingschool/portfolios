# Parker Lindley - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
  I really wanted to utilize some of the fundamentals of js that I'd learned in mod 2 in my projects and become comfortable with React and Redux while also becoming more confident in my personal abilities.

## A: End of Module Assessment
Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We completed two individual projects while in mod 3 in order to put ourselves to the test to see what we had learned and to take learning into our own hands.

#### (SWAPI-BOX)

* [swapi box](https://github.com/etcetera8/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI-BOX is a project that uses React and asynchronus JavaScript in order to display data from the star-wars api to the page. The user has the ability favorite characters, vehicles, or a planets in order to see them on a favorites page.

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### KOG LOCKER

* [KOG LOCKER](https://github.com/etcetera8/Kog-Locker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

In this project I was allowed to create any app I wanted as long as it utilized, React, Router and Redux. I knew Strava had a rich API filled with loads of data that I could utilize in any variety of ways. I decided I wanted to make a personal motivation app essentially 'gamifying' phsyical activity. I wanted to make 'badges' that a user could complete and wanted to display a target segment of road or trail that a user could set a goal to complete that segement in that amount of time. I used the google maps API to create and display a map and the user can update or change.

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested


### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.```

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group projects in mod 3 one of which was our first three person group project. It's nice being able to conquer issues with another person and also see different ways of looking at the same problem. It also teaches you to work with other people.

#### HEADCOUNT 2.0
* [HeadCount 2.0](https://github.com/etcetera8/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

In this group project we were assigned the task of taking in data from kindergaten attendance rates and displaying that to the page. When the user clicked on two cards it would compare the ratio between the two cards to display pertinent info to the user.

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow
- 4 

## Surprise and Delight
- 3 - Hot Fire


#### MOVIE TRACKER

This was three person project where we were tasked with creating an app where the user would sign up, login, and be taken to the landing page. The landing page would show all the current movies in theaters through an async api call to a movie database. Users were able to 'favorite' movies where it was stored in the backend. The user is able to see all of their favorites by clicking on the favorites tab.

### Gear Ups
Part of the curriculum at Turing is not only to teach us how to be good developers but good people. We had several sessions this mod that I will reflect upon.


#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

Microaggressions are something we have to deal with weather we like it or not. In fact ignoring that they exist goes exactly against what we can do to combat them. We have to acknowledge that we display microaggressions and learn when we do in order to not repeat them. A lot of people feel microaggressions during times of stress so its extra important to recognize them. I also noted how its important to forgive yourself for microaggressions because we are all human, and to error is human as Shakespeare said.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Humans are by nature social creatures so it was no surprise to me that many individuals holding the same values lends to a general zeitgeist of the group. It's important that a group acknowledges that this can pose a potential problem to people who don't hold the same values or are different than the group. Groups should openly try to fight the urge to amalgamate and be open to different people in order to have a more diverse outlook. I like to think of diversity like hands, wouldn't it be nice to have more hands to do more things? I think Turing does a really good job at all of the above, at least talking about it, I don't see large amount of diversity at Turing but it's hard for me to say, ive never ran an organization and am a white male but I think its good that the conversation is there because many places it isn't.

#### ETHICS IN AI

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/Group_1.md)

My group ended up having a really intense conversation about what we do as a society and when a ton of jobs are automated. Some argued that there should be a 'robot' tax on companies for each robot that takes a human jobs. Others argued for a UBI or universal basic income that every person would receive. I'm not too strongly opinionated on it one way or the other but I was thinking maybe there could be a bit of both. I realize the transition will probably be really rough. We also talked briefly what we could do as developers creating AI could do to remain within moral bounds. I mentioned transparency and the ability to turn off and on portions of AI before it gets too smart and then we can't do anything.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Last mod I attended as many of the Iron-Fe's that I could and wanted to give back by attending as many as this mod to help give back. Unfortunately I was not able to attend and help out with as many as I wanted as I felt far more weighed down with project deadlines this mod. I still managed to make a few in the end. I also paired with several mod 1 and 2 students through the past six weeks. I led a small session during swapi-box to get a few of my classmates caught up to where I was at that moment in time because we were all struggling with the same issue. I think it was on hitting the multiple endpoints. 

------------------

## Final Review

Overall this has been the mod that I've struggled through the most but with that struggle has come a lot of understanding. I feel very comfortable with a lot of javascript topics that were either unknown or I was a little weak on. I was extremely pleased with how much I enjoyed using React and then later on Redux and am excited to keep working on my personal project. I thought it was pretty cool how weak I felt on testing but then, during the final assessment, was able to write a fairly decent test suite in a short amount of time. I feel closer to my classmates than ever and keep being surprised by the caliber of instructors as each mod progresses and look forward to the next and (kind of )sadly final.
