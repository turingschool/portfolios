# Parker Lindley - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Coming into this mod I really wanted to get a deeper understanding of JavaScript and to be able to come into a project, set up the frame work, and follow through filling it in. I was also determined to get an 'official' mentor through the list at Turing and was happy to have one accept me and meetup multiple times.

## A: End of Module Assessment
I passed the end of module assesments


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this mod were the sorting-suites, complete-me, and the react static comp.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/etcetera8/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project I wrote and implemented a bubble, insertion, merge and quick sort algorithm with a full mocha/chai testing suite. Each sort sorted numbers or letters from low to high.

#### Evaluator: Leta

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/etcetera8/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

  For this project I wrote and implemented a prefix trie that could populate the trie, suggest responses, delete words and insert words. The entire prefix had a mocha/chai testing suite to test all functionality.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were GameTime and Weathrly.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/etcetera8/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

In this project we set out to recreate the classic arcade game Joust. We used HTML5's canvas feature and implemented object classes to create a two player game where each player mounted a bird and attempted to kill the other player by 'flying' on top of the other. We also instantiated an enemy class that each player either had to avoid or could kill by jumping on top of them and then collecting the egg that falls out of them for points. Whichever player has the most points at the end of the round or has taken all the other players lives wins.

### Evaluator: Nathanial

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.


#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/etcetera8/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project we were tasked with creating a React weather app using the Weather Undergrounds API. We needed to make stateful and stateless components and be able to handle click events and pass props around to the relevant components and update just those components that need updating.

### Evaluator: Nathanial

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### JavaScript/React Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)
#### Getting Jobs from Blogs
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_4.md)

I sat with the Mod 4 students running the Jobs from Blogs gear-up. When I was younger I was really interested in writing and have a semi-active blog I do on my own, but use it more to just reflect on my coding journey. This session was all about writing a technical blog post in order to give back to the community and also to help yourself standout in the crowd as someone who knows what they're talking about. I would like to write a technical blog post over the future. I remember being frustrated about lack of information on setting up an HTML5 canvas game so I'd like to do one on that or what exactly 'promises' are in react mostly so I can understand them on a deeper level.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

The gear up session on the 'Attention Economy' was really insightful. I'd never thought about how true it is that our attention is the finite supply that all of these companies are vying for our attention and spending probably millions of dollars perfecting the ability to capture every moment they can. I think it's really important to be able to step away from these distractions and I really enjoyed my groups discussion on it. One part I liked was that we talked how it was natural to feel guilty about being 'addicted' to certain apps but that they're designed that way. We also talked about methods of taking the power back, such as setting your phone on airplane mode or deleting some of the app you don't really 'need' even if just for a short amount of time.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

Part of the reason I chose Turing over other schools was the social justice aspect and how it sets out to be a place of safety and welcome for all. I really enjoy that we're able to have these difficult conversations in school. I think it makes having the conversation in not as welcoming or safe spaces easier to handle. I've thought of a lot of the issues we've talked about in class but I'd say the most surprising were just some of the smaller things I've never had to think about like walking home from school at night is not a big deal to me but can be scary and dangerous for many. It's hard to talk about some of the disadvantages I feel I've faced because they're pretty personal but I think a lot of people can relate to what substance abuse in the family can do to the family and growing up. I really hope that we can take these conversations out and remember that everything we have is not necessarly because we 'earned it' but that some had to 'earn it' with more effort.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

- I attended almost all of the Iron FE meetings in order to prepare for solving javascript problems and get better at white boarding in front of people. I also just like doing javascript problems. I made a point to make myself available to mod 1 for pairing as much as I could. It was fun and taught me a lot pairing with the new mod. Nora and I were also assigned the task of organizing our class leading a mythical-creatures training session for the new mod. I led one of the sessions and 'floated' quite a bit helping people get through problems. I learned how much you can learn through teaching.
