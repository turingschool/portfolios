# Jeff Goodall - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to learn as much as I could. I started off hesitant that it would difficult to "teach this old dog new tricks" but I was able to find myself fitting in pretty well with my class. Even though I feel very much like I am drinking from a fire hose on full blast, I picked up everything that has been laid down. I have jumped into projects head first and come away feeling accomplished and capable. I have gone into assesments and been compleatly confused and used my processes to poke the bear until I found a solution. I have waken up in the middle of the night and pulled out my computer to code a solution that has been on my mind. I have sought help from everyone around me including my teachers, students. I have drank from the fire hose on full force and prevailed!

# B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

## Palette Picker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/palette-picker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

Abstract:
There is a website out there called Coolors - and others like it are out there. They help you generate color palettes for websites or other design projects.

Your job is to recreate some of this site’s functionality with your own backend and database. A user should be able to come to your site, generate a color palette, and save it for their own future projects.

## Pattrn Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/pattrn-party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/pattrn-party.html)

Project Overview
Every week you will be given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive and the HTML, CSS, and (when/if needed) JS must be written in a modular way. The goal is to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase.

# C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

## House of Vars

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/refined-github-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

Abstract
So far we’ve been building a lot of projects from scratch. While this is a great way to learn, it doesn’t quite prepare you for the horror that is jumping into a pre-existing codebase full of bugs, legacy code and unfamiliar frameworks and libraries. In this project, we’ll learn how to navigate and contribute to someone else’s codebase by implementing features, refactoring old code, and fixing bugs: all without breaking anything. Be careful what you touch! The slightest change could bring the whole app down.

## Build Your Own Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/byob)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

Abstract
Practice makes practice. Last week’s project had you dive head first into a full-stack application with Node, Express, Knex, and a front-end to boot. That was a lot thrown at you in one week so this time around we are going to focus solely on the backend. You’ll be building your own API for a large dataset of your choosing.

The main focus of this project will be to reinforce your understanding of CRUD methods, querying a database, and responding with JSON data. You can do this project right now, without any new lessons.

The secondary focus of this project is prepping your Capstone project so you have data ready to go and can dive into building a super badass UI instead of wasting a week in Node land. It’s not necessary that you find perfect data for your Capstone, but it’s vital that you know how to setup production APIs that are well tested. You can easily replace the source of your data, so don’t worry if you can’t come up with a good data source or if you have no idea what you want to build for the Capstone. Find or create interesting data that you might want to use in the future.

## Capstone (Bees a scrollytelling journey)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/bees-scrollytelling)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Abstract:
By the end of this session we will have established Capstone projects that’ll guide your last two weeks in the program. It’s your final project which means it’s your last opportunity to build something you’re really proud of and can show off for your portfolio. It’s also the last time you will get to work with your cohort-mates and master your workflow before becoming a professional developer. Take risks, be creative, work nicely with your team and build something useful for others.

Project Description:
Explore how bees are vital to agriculture, your happiness, and humanity's success as a species. This site takes you on a scrolling adventure that allows you to test your knowledge and learn in a fun, visual way.
