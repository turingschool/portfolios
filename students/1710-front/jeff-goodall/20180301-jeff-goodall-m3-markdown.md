# Jeff Goodall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to learn as much as I could. I started off hesitant that it would difficult to "teach this old dog new tricks" but I was able to find myself fitting in pretty well with my class. Even though I feel very much like i am drinking from a fire hose on full, I have been picking up everything that has been laid down. I have jumped into projects head first and come away feeling accomplished and capable. I have gone into assesments and been compleatly confused and worked my way (poking the bear) until I found a solution. I have waken up in the middle of the night and pulled out my computer to code a solution that has been on my mind. I have sought help from everyone around me including my teachers, students in my mod and mod's above and below me. I have drank from the fire hose on full force and prevailed!

## SWapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.


##### Evaluator:Christie
##### Students: Jeff Goodall
##### Comments: Nested fetches should be broken out into separate functions... this way you can test them

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
1 - Developer did not make any effort to use React effectively or refactor code.

##### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##### Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

##### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

##### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.



## Farmers Market Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/farmers-market-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

##### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

##### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

##### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Redux Architecture

* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

##### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.



# C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

## HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.



#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The tragedy of the commons is a term used in social science to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.

I am surprised by how much of a difference this makes when employers are hiring people like them. The website with the examples was very surprising. I enjoyed search through the different senarios and see how it effectid the outcomes.

#### From Introvert to Influential

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_5.md)

I was disappointed in this gear up. I picked it because I wanted to get better and learn some tools to help with my lack of confidence. except when i arrived the first excercise was to meet the person next to me and then introduce them in front of everyone. I do see the help of putting people on the spot but I was hopeing for something different. 

The best part of the excercise was the video with the ted talk. it had several incites that I found very helpful.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have supported the community by attending every friday morning talk this mod. I taught Iron FE twice. I have been open minded about the diversity in the class room and I must admit that it is more diverce then I have been around in a long time if ever. I am a part of the school community just by being here and standing up to learn more about our vision statement. I am a better person for being here.
