# Jeff Goodall - M2 Portfolio
 
 ## Areas of Emphasis
 
 My goal was to learn as much as I could. I started off hesitant that it would difficult to "teach this old dog new tricks" but I was able to find myself fitting in pretty well with my class. Even though I feel very much like i am drinking from a fire hose on full, I have been picking up everything that has been laid down. I have jumped into projects head first and come away feeling accomplished and capable. I have gone into assesments and been compleatly confused and worked my way through to a solution. I have waken up in the middle of the night and pulled out my computer to code a solution that has been on my mind. I have sought help from everyone around me including my teachers, students in my mod and mod's above me. I have drank from the fire hose on full force and prevailed!

 -----------------------
 
 ## A: End of Module Assessment
 
 A very tough challenge that I WAY overthought... I worked hard this semester to attend every Iron FE meeting and work on my reps outside of class. This MOD I also challenged myself to create boilerplates for each project and to incorporate my spin on the frameworks. I also adopted a new text editor and challenged myself to learn new things.
 
 My pairings were succesful and each were a learning experience. Taking into consideration the outside of Turing influences that i had to deal with in my life and the difficult curriculum at Turing i am very proud of my performance and learning abiities. 
 
 I feel that I have passed MOD 2 at Turing.
 
 ## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
 I lovedd the individual projects I completed this Mod. they were challenging and rewarding. This MOD I completed Sorting-Suite and  Complete-Me projects individualy.

 Game Time was a great project. I partnered with Spencer Herms and we KILLED IT. lol acctually we killed alot of ducks. The premise was a game that could fire and move fluidly in all directions and we succeded in accomplihing that task. Along with some cool graphics and sound!! 
 
 ### Evaluator: LETA
 
 #### Functional Expectations
 
 * 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

 * Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
 
 #### JavaScript Style
 
 * 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing
 
 #### Workflow
 
 * 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
 
 #### Code Sanitation
 
 * 4 - Zero complaints

 #### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)
 
 * Be your own Ally
 
 A very good gear up and it seemed like the others that picked that session were also similar to me in personality also. some of the key things that I came away with was:
 
   - no one is put on this earth to make my life work. It is my job and mine alone.
   - I choose to make myself a bit more important to me then others are to me. I will not self sacrifice unless it benifits me also.
 
 #### Attention Economy
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)
 
   - the thought of the Attention Economy makes perfect sence. With so much data and media outlets that there is now, entertainment is all trying to get some of our time. For example how rediculus is it that we expect to pay for cable television and it still has commercials as part of the programing. they companies are makeing money on both ends of the spectum. both coming in and out... and they are able to do it because of the attention they command. As consumers we have lots of options and the options just keep expanding so the companies that get our attention first usual are able to keep it. Netflix is an example of this. 
 
   - the difficulty is being able to turn of the surrondings and block out and focus your attention on the things that matter most, and the things that can improve your life. I know that I have a difficult time not turning on the Netflix at night and veging out to the comedy that makes me laugh. Something to keep working on is finding the balence.
 
 #### Empathy and Privilidge
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
 
 Final Refelction from the Empathy lesson in Gear up:
 
   People offten talk about how men answer more questions in this class. I would like to debate that it is personality instead of sexual differences. this is a  safe place and we all learn from asking questions. there is no need to count who of what gender answers questions in class more. I believe that this mentality is actually adding to the issue of gender bias. I feel as if it is my job/place to keep the classroom as a safe place for any question. that way everyone has the same oppertunity. I believe if this type of pattern emerged in the beginning and throughout peoples lifes there would be no gender difference in number of questions asked and who put themselves out there enough to challenge themselves. I feel that even if that was not the case for all of us, if we start now then it is still possilble to break that invisable barrier.
 
 
 ## E: Community Participation
 
 ### Playing a Part
 
 I have supported the community by attending every friday morning talk this mod. I also was able to attend every session of Iron FE in the mornings. I have been open minded about the diversity in the class room and I must admit that it is more diverce then I have been around in a long time if ever. I am a part of the school community just by being here and standing up to learn more about our vision statement. I am a better person for being here.
