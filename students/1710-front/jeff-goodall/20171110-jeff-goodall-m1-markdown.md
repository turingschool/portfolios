# Jeff Goodall - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to learn as much as I could. I started off hesitant that it would difficult to "teach this old dog new tricks" but I was able to find myself fitting in pretty well with my class. Even though I feel very much like i am drinking from a fire hose on full I have been picking up everything that has been laid down. I have jumped into projects head first and come away feeling accomplished and capable. I have gone into assesments and been compleatly confused and worked my way through to a solution. I have waken up in the middle of the night and pulled out my computer to code a solution that has been on my mind. I have sought help from everyone around me including my teachers, students in my mod and mod's above me. I have drank from the fire hose on full force and prevailed!

* Good use of labels in html
* Try to nail the comp to a t next time and maybe experiment on other git branches
* Add some comments in css for better organization
* Be more explicit and verbose when naming functions and variables

#### Evaluator: David
#### Notes/What To Work On:

#### html
* Indentation in html is almost there but could use another combthrough
* Comments in html seem redundant for production code
* Would recommend using a minified version of jquery in future projects for faster load times

#### css
* No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only
* Try to avoid using negative values in css

#### js
* Cool to see that you used both function expressions and declarations, but pick
  one or the other in the future
* Would like to see more consistency and diligence with spacing, indentation,
  and semicolons
* lines 34 and 35 should be moved toward top as they are currently floating in
  no mans land
* Would like to see more verbose names of vars and functions and more verb like
  function names
  * ie. `urlInputValidator()` could be renamed to `validateUrl()`

#### git/github
* Would like to see more verbose commit messages and have those commits tell
  more of a story

#### Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

#### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
#### Notes/What To Work On:

- Majority of functionality met!!! Everything persisting as should. However, can create blank cards with no title/body.
- Stays true to the spirit of the comp. Drop heavy border around inputs. No indication visually of when the submit button is disabled. 
- Good amound of commits
- Nice organization in CSS.
- Nice indentation in HTML file. Good use of semantic tags and labels. Could place aria-label directly on element if you don't want anything displayed. Be sure to add lang attribute to HTML.
- Opportunities for refactoring in JScode - Lines 1-3 should have variables declared with $. Naming is confusing at times and hard to follow. Unnecessary arguments being passed in on Line 36. Making instances of same object in lines 39 and 45. createCardObject should take whole object - not individual parameters. Really long event listeners that could use refactoring.

#### Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

### HTML

#### Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

### CSS

#### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes


* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

### GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### GitHub

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

### DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

### PAIRING

#### Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### Growth Mindset
This session started the discussion on the mentality of a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset. I see that this was very impactful to me. A growth mindset doesnt come naturally to me but I am a happier person when I have this positive mindset. I spent most the the mod catching myself when I used a fixed mindset and changing it to a growth mindset. this was a lesson that I will take with me for sure.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
Throwing my hands in the air and yelling screw this is something I may, or may not, have done this mod. getting better at difficult things directly relates to Turing and handeling the stress of the program. I definitly enjoy that the staff realises that the process is a difficult one and takes that into consideration. We tend to put ourselfs in a box and not step out of it. getting better at difficult things tought me how to deal with being an imposter feeling and I am very thankful.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts
I liked this session because of the groups. in the beginning we started by picking a spot on the line of where we thought we would be on the extrovert introvert line. This was great because I imedialy was next to like minded people and it helped me feel compfortable immediatly. As a group we walked around the room and read about each group and how to relate to them despite the difference of personality. I think the comments will help me work with introverts and extroverts better going forward.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
I very much liked the historical aspect of this documentary. I relate to the historical past better in fact it is one of my strength finder traits. the truth is that diversity never hurts and any industry that doesnt have much diversity is going to have issues staying relevant. The gammer geek is a steriotype of developers that needs to be changed. Developers are a unique personallity and that can limit the amount of females in the industry because it is not cool. As the scope of the insdustry keeps growing there is deffinitly room for more diversity in the industry and that diversity should start with integrading females, it ends when the developer world is a perfect little sample of the diversity of the world.

#### Case Study with Mod 4 : Not Taking yourself too seriusly
remember rule #6.“It’s really very simple. Rule Number Six is ‘Don’t take yourself so damned seriously.’” “And what, may I ask, are the other rules?” The host replied, “There aren’t any.” if everything is the most important then nothing is important! working with Mod 4 on this lesson was helpful and made me realize that what is important to me may not acctually be impartant at all and that I should not take myself so seriously. The best example of this is being able to take feedback like a champ it involves making a commitment to not take myself to seriously. reminds me of my favorite quote "When we are closed to ideas, what we hear is criticism. When we are open to criticism, what we get is advice." - Simon Sinek


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I have supported the community by attending every friday morning talk this mod. I also have cleaned things in the kitchen and assisted in the recyleing efforts around campus by recycling and taking the recycling to the bigger cans on occation. I have been open minded about the diversity in the class room and I must admit that it is more diverce then i have been around in a long time if ever. I am a part of the school community just by being here and standing up to learn more about our vision statement. I am a better person for being here.
