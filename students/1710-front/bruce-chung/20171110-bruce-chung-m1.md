# Bruce Chung - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I entered the module with very basic javascript knowledge and almost no experience in CSS or HTML. My goal was to learn as much as possible by adhering to tight schedule and trying to stay ahead of the curve.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results.  I was able to arrive early and review the lesson, pair early and often, and work through projects over the weekend so that most of the week was review.  A point of improvement for next mod is to stay just as disciplined with my workout schedule so that I can remain focused and energetic.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects included Number Guesser, the first project, and three static compositions that were spread over the last half of the module.  

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/numberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was the first project and it working through it gave me an understanding of DOM manipulation and event listeners.  It was also my first exposure to putting together html, css, and js in one project.  

##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

##### Comments:
 - Insults generator for th3 win! Like that you are pushing yourself to experiment with code outside of the requirements
 - Nice work with ARIA ---> and using the lang attribute in your HTML
 - Be sure to organize CSS and check for any redundancy
 - Works towards single responsibility in your JS functions. Understands scope.
 - Though it technically can be done, best practice is to separate your markup from your JS functionality (i.e. no click     handlers in your HTML)

#### Static Composition 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/static-comp1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp 1 was a good introduction to flexbox.  I learned responsive design and how to use media queries.  

Evaluator Comments:
 - white text is unreadable on yellow background, need more contrast
 - needs better icon and text spacing
 - margins are too tight on collapse, and images and text need to be centered
 - colors do not match image

#### Static Composition 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/bc-static-comp2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comp 2 was more complicated than the first, with cards that need to be aligned left when shifted to another row (on collapse).  It was perhaps also my best of the three - I was able to preserve main image while remaining true to the original comp by introducing a hover state that laid out the required information.  

Evaluator Comments:
 - nav bar icons need a hover state and live state
 - beige background color??
 - margins in header are different on L and R side
 - consider having hover states active for mobile

#### Static Composition 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/bc-static-comp3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Static Comp 3 was a massive jump in difficulty from 1 and 2, resulting in nearly 800 lines of css alone.  It was a serious and businesslike design comp, and I recreated it to display military jet aircraft (with a graph hover state to humor my instructors). Successes included having three successful media queries, having good alignment on all major items, and having good organization on collapse.  Points for improvement below.

Evaluator Comments:
 - heavy borders, topbar icons should be larger
 - too many divs in the sidebar
 - "specifications" button misaligned
 - mobile layout: nav bar collapse looks unintentional


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects included Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox.  Projects were done in pairs, and they were a great chance to learn git/github workflow and learn how to collaborate with another developer.  

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/Linked-List-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was the first pair project and an introduction to JQuery.  It was a good experience with in-person pair programming using driver-navigator, and distance work through slack/github.  We learned to use 'this' effectively in conjunction with an event listener.

##### Evaluator: David Whitaker

##### Comments: 
 - Pay more attention to detail on comp - ie. button should not have a border radius html
 - USE FORMS!!!!!!! Inputs should have labels!!!
 - Html style is pretty solid, but still room for improvement in indentation(ie. line 20 should be indented)
 - css could use some organizational comments in css, no need for empty line at beginning of file
 - css could consider using inline blocks instead of position absolute for desktop breakpoint
 - Seeing hex and rgba values for colors - pick one or the other
 - Check for duplicate lines in CSS and break out into class if possible
 - js Be weary when using large ternaries
 - jsComments seem unnecessary/redundant
 - js Great job naming functions
 - js Try to only use global vars when absolutely necessary - could probably make some of global vars local in this project
 - js Be more consistent with spacing, indentation, and semicolons(each time block is nested should be indented two spaces or one tab)
 - git/github Tell more of a story with commit messages, but love that I'm seeing a lot of commits

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Nora Gully)
Having Bruce as my partner was a great experience and very motivational. I liked that he wanted to get work done early and to get a lot of help at the beginning. This, along with his excellent communication skills, really minimized our overall stress and avoided conflicts. I thought it was fun to work with Bruce in-person and I felt he took the time to get to know me over lunch and beer. For example, I was touched that he thought to encourage me before my Lightning Talk on Thursday. I appreciated that he was open to my ideas and willing to play around with jQuery together at an early stage, even if it meant learning together through trial and error. I also love that he was motivated to help other people with their projects with the extra time we had during class. While Bruce is a great teacher, I felt that he moved a little too quickly for me at times with the script and that sometimes I was playing catch-up. I never felt lost - these were features we were working on together - but maybe he could have been more sensitive to whether I was going in the right direction, and then pushed me harder to generate the answer even if he already knew it. I also noticed that at the outset, we set goals about what we wanted to work on, but didn't necessarily stick to them. So for example, I wanted to work on Javascript/jQuery and Bruce wanted to work on CSS, but when push came to shove, we just stuck to what we were good at. Our git workflow was a little haphazard and could be more deliberate, (i.e. making a branch more specific and merging it when the feature is complete). I think Bruce also accidentally committed changes on master when he should have been on a branch. Confusion with git is to be expected at this point, though, and I'm glad we got things like merge conflicts taken care of without messing things up! Overall working with Bruce was awesome and I have definitely learned a lot from him during this project!

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Ideabox introduced local storage, objects, and constructor functions.

##### Evaluator: Louisa Barrett

##### Comments: 
 - buggy behavior
 - quality value disappears in some user cases? unclear what causes it
 - can still create an idea with nothing in the inputs. details matter, and this is not a small detail.
 - no disabled state on button
 - very tidy, clean codebase
 - CSS uses percentages for height, use a different unit of measure. This can cause very unpredictable behavior/movement/scaling as a user resize the browser window and when you are building more complex UI it will be a major headache.
 - used no classes, only ids being used in HTML -- not flexible or modular as ids cannot be reused on a page.
 - UI needs a lot of work. was built at 150% zoom, and is not well executed when it is viewed at 100%.

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Jordan Quinn)
Bruce, you were great to work with my man. I really appreciated your willingness to put a lot of time in over the weekend and get ahead of the ballgame. Additionally, you did a great job reining me back in when I started to pursue rabbit holes that just didn't need to get pursued. Thank you for being willing to tackle extra work load when all of my life stuff kept coming up, that meant the world to me! I felt we had an extremely positive work environment/flow. As far as something actionable goes... work zoomed in at 100% of screen size. (: It caught us both by surprise during our eval when our scale was off due to working at an altered percentage. Other than that, keep on keeping on!


#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was an inherited project (someone else's IdeaBox) that needed refactoring and additional functionality.  By this project, I reached a comfort level where the project was completed very efficiently. 

##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

##### Comments: 
 - Design is pretty accurate. Fully responsive. Move 'show more' button down to bottom or make it obvious to the user that more cards have been added off-screen.
 - Add indication on hover that buttons are clickable. Text on the buttons themselves is kind of large.
 - YAY for completing 2/3 of the extensions!
 - Be sure to have a DTR next time. Glad to hear that pairing went well without having one in place.
 - Good naming on commits/branches.
 - Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good spacing/indentation. And HOORAY for forms!!!
 - Add lang attribute to HTML. Be sure to add ARIA to dynamically rendered HTML in JS file.
 - Next time, use a screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader. The contrast on the filter buttons is not sufficient, per accessibility testing.
 - CSS could use a quick pass for refactor. Just under 20 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading stylesheets and inheritance. Outline-style is none by default.
 - JS file is pretty good overall. Easy to follow logic and code is pretty readable. Nice use of array prototypes in some functionality! Very little redundancy - love how you combined functionality for editing title/task and changing importance. Areas for refactoring below:
 - Lines 18-22 could be refactored into single event listener by passing in $(this).text() as argument instead of hardcoded string (being sure to adjust for case-sensitivity).
 - Unnecessary parameters placed (importance and completed) in line 74.

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Casey Dallavalle)
Bruce and I totally hit this project out of the park! Initially when we started, Bruce was driving and I was navigating, which was working fine but we both didn't realize that we each preferred the other's role. When we figured that out, we got together and just churned out working code, which was wonderful! I do prefer working on javascript together, so I was a little disappointed when initially we started doing the work separate. Later, though, we started doing the javascript coding together and that made me feel much more comfortable with our project. The only coaching feedback that I have for Bruce centers around just one interaction we had. We were trying to refactor a couple of lines of code and after about fifteen minutes, I mentioned that what we were doing wasn't worth the time and the space we would save. I wanted to stop but Bruce insisted on finishing the code, which we spent another thirty minutes to get the code working. In the end, we both agreed it wasn't worth keeping and we had wasted a good 45 minutes doing the problem. However, other times, when I wanted to stop doing the work and Bruce kept me going, it was definitely worth it! I just think sometimes it's about finding the right things to focus on. We had a great partnership and it rocked though!!

## D: Professional Skills
Turing strives to produce well-rounded developers that can excel in the modern workplace.  The philosophy is that since coding skills are only a portion what makes a successful programmer, there is a lot of emphasis placed on professional skills.  The sessions from Mod1 are included below.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The growth mindset is a way to approach difficult situations and perservere.  Someone with growth mindset sees barriers as an opportunity to grow, and contrasts with someone with a fixed mindset - that difficulties are a roadblock to someones innate, unchangeable abilities.   

#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

A very good session on managing cognitive resources.  There are three categories: need to learn, learning, and mastered.  The first and last categories take little to no resources, with the goal being to move items to mastered as quickly as possible.  Potential holdups include a buildup of items in the "learning" section, and items in the "mastered" section that are not quite at the level they should be.  Solutions include moving items from learning section to need to learn (in an effort to reduce cognitive drain) and to remaster items that need to be revisited.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts and Extroverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This session involved separating into groups based on introvert/extrovert scale.  The twist was you had to rate yourself in the Turing spectrum - which put me at the end of the Extrovert scale.  Brainstorming in groups gave information on how introverts and extrovers like to function and limitations they may have.  Takeaways for extroverts are that they function best when they have independence and they naturally gravitate toward leadership roles.  Takeaways for introverts are that you should not put them in situations they are not comfortable with and that they may need time alone.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This introduced us to the perspective of a woman in tech and barriers they may overcome.  Difficulties include assumptions based on their level of ability, the need to constantly prove themselves, and just plain sexism.  The industry needs women, and there are many steps we can take to make women comfortable in the industry.

#### Block-Chain Technology with Mod4

My first choice of the gearup sessions with mod 4. Block-chain technology is here to stay, and we had a good discussion on how it works and how it will impact the financial and political sectors.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to be as involved as I could in the community.  I was a SAB rep and I attended multiple group events, including TAAAP, Iron Front End, and participated in Turing-veteran discussions.  Within my class, I was active in facilitating group events after class was out, helped my peers with projects when I could, and pushed for an event to give back to Mod2 (breakfast burritos).
