# Bruce Chung - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for the mod were to learn React/Redux as well as I could, and begin to look outside Turing to get a picture of the local industry.  I was able to accomplish the first goal - I feel very comfortable in React and Redux.  For my second goal, I was able to attend a number of events, but was not as successful as I hoped due to M3 being more time-intensive than anticipated.

#### Personal Project - News-Rater

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/truth-checker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Final project of the mod.  The idea is to rate news based on an url input, so that fake news might be detected (or an indication of how likely the news is to be real). The url is first sent to a crawler to break out data into a meaningful object, and then the author, organization, and text are sent to Google Scholar, the Better Business Bearu Api, and the Watson TOne analysis api respectively.  Scores are then normalized and aggregated into a single number (0-100).

Completion
3: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

CSS/Design
3+ - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Code Quality
3+ - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

Redux Architecture
3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Testing
3 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Redux Architecture
4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

Routing
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

The way I understood microaggressions from this session is they can be similar to bias - subtle, unconscious thoughts that take form in hurtful actions.  This session explored sources of microaggressions and how they might present themselves.  Besides the standard bias in sex, race, religion, and age, this session also explored socioeconomic background and family structure.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

A session involving scrollytelling and interactive programming to demonstrate how a small bias can lead to large division in the community.  Very good demonstration in the illustrative power of programming.

#### Relax

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_3.md)

Main takeaway is that there are many ways to destress, but meditation should be considered by everyone.  Other ways to desgress include physical activity, mentally relaxing activities, spritual activities...


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've stayed involved with 1711 and 1801.  I informally pair roughly every other day and I am always available for to help.  I've been involved in iron-FE. I attended a hackathon and was able to work in a team with back-end students for the first time.
