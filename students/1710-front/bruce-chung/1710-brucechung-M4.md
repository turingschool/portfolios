##What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I had two main achievements this mod.  The first is that I gained a basic understanding of databases and how to interact with them. Based on this experience, I would consider being a full-stack developer my preference.  The other achievement is in vim, and I know its an unusual item to list on an end of module reflection, but I've spent siginificant effort understanding, customizing, and practicing.  I'm already faster in vim than in sublime, and there are noticeable payouts to my workflow.

##What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
I think it was difficult to maintain a balance between jobsearch, classwork, and a healthy lifestyle.  It was also hard for me to manage burnout.  I think the workload in mod4 was rougly on par with the other mods, except with the added expectation that there would be progress in career development areas. I had difficulty throughout turing maintaining a healthy lifestyle while trying to achieve a high standard, and it was even harder in the last mod.

##What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I think in relation to my peers, I have a greater interest in databases. I explored many-to-many relationships in the byob project.  I also learned vim.

##How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Honestly, I love front-end technologies and JS as well, but going through Turing and learning about the greater world of tech has really opened my eyes to where I would be most motivated to make contributions, and that is not on web technologies.  I'm fascinated by tech that has the capacity to revolutionize how we live our daily lives, and I think the most immediate of those are self-driving cars.  How will this change how we live our lives, now that we have all the time spent commuting to focus our mind on other things? How will it revolutionize traffic? I think that machine learning is key to breaking in to these industries, so a masters in this area is on the table after a few years of cs work. 

##What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
I've always appreciated that Turing's mission has always been about more than code.  They are very good at teaching code, but I think it's all the other lessons about living and getting along with other groups of people that are most valuable. I also appreciate how much public speaking the program makes you do, and I feel like I've grown in that area as well.
