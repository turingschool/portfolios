# Ricardo Viera - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal this mod was to rekindle an interest in the world of web design. 3.5 years away from computers had me questioning if I wanted to continue down this path at all. I figured I'd throw myself back into it head first and see if I might rediscover something I thought I had lost and finally learn how to program at the same time! So far, my expectations have been far surpassed and frankly I've discovered an interest in programming that I thought did not exist. I had no desire to struggle with programming languages, yet despite that I find myself more intrigued with the potential these languages provide access to. Turing's process is very impressive and I'm more and more excited to be in this program as each day passes. I also wanted to find out if I could build a schedule that will allow me to have success at Turing withoug neglecting time with my new family. This may in fact be the most difficult aspect this whole endeavor.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During Mod 1 at Turing my individual projects were *Number Guesser* and *Static Comps 1-3*. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first project involving HTML/CSS and most importantly Javascript. We were required to build out a game in which the user generates a random number that they will then attempt to guess the number that was generated. There were several phases to the project and I was only able to meet the second phase. I think this project was a huge wake up call that Turing is no joke. I had no real expectations about Turing as a whole and the expectations until this project. It was a much needed ego check for me. I was surprised at how quickly I was able to progress in JS with this project, despite the low marks during the eval, which were needed. 

**Evaluator: Louisa & David**

**evaluation comments**
-watch spacing and indentation in HTML, CSS, and JS
-interesting slider to select range, but used a slider that was found online and didn't build it from scratch. Didn't fully understand how it was hooked up and how it worked. Disappointed to see that what could have been the most interesting part of this app was something that you didn't build yourself or completely understand.
-don't make excuses for the state/status of your work. What you bring to an eval is what we care about. We are reviewing and discussing what you actually did, not what you intended to do, and the reasons why something isn't fully flushed out (unless there was an real emergency you were dealing with) are irrelevant.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/RV-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Right out of the gate, we were presented with a pretty challenging Static comp. One with many moving parts and definitely a challenge to make responsive. I chose my favorite Hobby that is Astronomy. Attempted to match the static comp as best I could using flex-box. Never touched flex-box before and it had a steeper learning curve than expected. Removed the animations I originally had in place... :(

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**evaluation comments**
Louisa's evalution in general was quite positive. My site structure and design choices were a bit muddled as she pointed out. I should have moved the "gallery" section into a different position and I should have picked a different featured picture for the gallery as I had multiple images with Stars in the background that seemed to need more contrast between them. 


#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/RV-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Our second static comp was another step up towards dealing with cards. This seems to be a commong theme here at Turing and I can definitely understand it's real world applications. It was fun to build out this project and I felt more compeled to get creative with this comp. I couldn't decide on my theme until I watched the first episode of season 2 of stranger things. I had some issues with getting the "mobile" version of the menu working in all views and only with css. I wanted to utilize flex box sparingly and what I think is properly in this comp. It's only brought in on the card wrap and keeps that cards stacking the way I had hoped.

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**evaluation comments**
Overall Louisa seemed to like the layout. I could do with a less saturated background and work on spacing the cards a little better considering the bright red borders that were added to the Character cards. Also, I need to pay more attention to the spacing of the core elements as the page is scaled to larger screens. 


#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/RV-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)


Static comp 3 was everyting and then some. It's a true real world layout that we most likely will have to build if we plan on working as professional front end developers. Multiple cards, multiple nav structures, many possible interactions and interesting design decisions to make as you compress the layout for smaller screens. This project was definitely more intense than I expected. I tried to keep things as basic as possible, but found I kept adding more and more to compensate for odd use cases. I'm not too excited about the final results as I'm certain with a bit more time I could really get this polished up. As it sits there are a few wonky interactions and movements that I'm sure will stick out like sore thumbs. It was good to go back into the CSS hell and dig my way out again.

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**evaluation comments**
Overall Louisa was quite positive with during the Eval. We spoke of refining my css classes and creating less specificity to allow for a more dynamic and usefull css code base. She introduced me to BEM methodologies and I look forward to implimenting that in my future projects. There were several relatively minor style oversights, like font colors, etc that could use a clean up. Once again, the spacing of my details graph elements were a little off on a larger screen. There were also a few elements that behaved a little odd due to mis use of width percentages within my media queries. I also relied on media queries a bit too much. 8 is more than enough and could use some refactoring to reduce those calls. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Mod 1 at Turing required several group work and pairing projects. They were *Linked List*, *Idea Box*, and *2DoBox Pivot* 
I really enjoyed my paired project experiences. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first paired project at Turing. We were tasked with building out a card creation interface. One that allowed users to enter Titles and Url's to various websites and generate a corresponding card. It was fun to dig into Javascript a bit more and get a hold of more real world scenarios. We relied on paring with other mods for extra tips and tricks. My partner was quite proficient and we were able to get ahead of the deadlines on this one.  

**Evaluator: Pam**

**evaluation comments**
-Can tell there was definite thought put into the user experience by your error messaging, card counter, and clear button.
-Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes. Remove animations unless it contributes to functionality.
-YAY for tracking of issues on your Trello Board. Move over to Waffle so the issues are trackable on your GitHub repo.
-Good use of branches and comments on your PRs.
-Be sure to implement other pieces of ARIA - alt, lang, labels on inputs.
-Appreciate your clustering of related properties for organizing your CSS!
-Opportunities for refactoring in JS - long functions and some redundancy (118-140). Return is not neccessary for if/else blocks in inputValidator. Lines 43-45 don't appear to be doing anything. Both could speak to code.

**Partner Feedback**
>I thought Ricardo and I both got along wonderfully. I was very impressed, yet not surprised by his ability. He taught me a lot about the workflow I might experience on the job. He has experience form working in the field as a developer in the past. I thought our communication was on point, we were always keeping in touch with our progress, struggles, and successes. Ricardo is a new father and I was very impressed by what appeared to me to be a very successful work/life balance while raising a kid and doing Turing. For coaching, I would just recommend that  Ricardo continue to develop his JavaScript skills. He mentioned at the beginning that it's something he wanted to develop. He showed awesome improvement during our pairing and he continues to show improvement. I know if he keeps working at it he'll continue to improve even more-so. Overall I think we were a rockstar team. 10/10, would do again.


#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Our project spec as assigned was to create an webpage that is able to accept user input for idea cards that are stored locally on the user's machine. This project also establishes some basic foundations for understanding interaction with user data in a limited scope. Each card is assigned a quality that is dynamic and can be changed by the user via an upvote/downvote. All cards should also persist on the page through reload. Users should also be able to make changes to each idea card and have the changes show dynamically without a page reload. This was super fun to work on. I enjoyed adding objects to Local storage and more than any other project, this felt the most realistic and had a powerful interaction with the browser. It opened my eyes to the power of Javascript and how it can be leveraged to to some awesome things. The pairing experience was once again enjoyable and I feel brings out the best in me. 

**Evaluator: David**

**evaluation comments**
-HTML

Appreciate the attempt at making the site screen reader accessible, however using tabindex everywhere is not necessary or sustainable
Work on proper indentation ie body should be tabbed in one from the html tags
Comments are redundant
Work on consistent casing and ideally have it be kabob-case

-CSS
Work on indentation and spacing in css
Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces
Make sure comments are correctly placed and consistent for organization

-JS
Work on passing objects instead of object properties
Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card
Work on more consistent spacing and indentation(no need for blank lines in functions)
Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

>Pairing with Ricardo was a fantastic experience! His knowledge of html structure and CSS definitely helped us to stay ahead of the workload and avoid any pitfalls. I also really appreciated Ricardo taking on CSS challenges of the project head on and making sure everything was perfect to the exact pixel of the comp. Ricardo also had an excellent attitude and work ethic every time we worked together making pairing sessions go very smoothly. He also asked a lot of very challenging questions during our pairing sessions that helped me to fully understanding our codebase better. I think that when he becomes really focused and honed in on solving an issue, it would be helpful if he would proactively cue in others if there is anything they can do to help his efforts. Ricardo has an infectious level of energy that makes pairing with him on a project very fun, I look forward to pairing with him again in the future!

#### 2Do-Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Our final paried project was a super interesting challenge. Refactoring someone elses code! I felt this project more than any other helped me solidify large concepts in programming. The other timing deadlines that surrounded this project were a huge challenge for me and my stress levels were elevated to their max. I'm quite happy that we still managed to finish off all phases of functionality and even managed to work on some of the extensions for the project. This felt much more like a real world project to me.

-Show more button still shows when there is nothing to show
-Counter attempt
-Toggle and no results messaging could be good additions

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset in general is a relatively new concept for me. I want to emphasize how huge this has been and the general philosophy has propogated most aspects of my life. It's easier to pinpoint where I'm getting stuck in a fixed mindset now and maybe more importantly when those around me are stuck in that mindset. There are many things I need to work on with this notion, but I think simply being aware of it's effects is half the battle. I look forward to breaking through the fixed mindsets I have that are sure to continue to pop up during my time at Turing. Math... all the math = fixed mindset for me...

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This was a fun session to take part in. It was interesting to see where my fellow classmates felt they were on the spectrum of introverts vs. extroverts. I also enjoy interacting with students in the back end mods. This helped me realize how I might be interpreted by introverts, sometimes. 

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I love this Ted talk and it's implications. I have a little bit of skepticism about how simply exposure to repeated expertise can bring out learned abilities much quicker but I'm excited to try it. The other notions about mental bandwidth are particularly importan while here at Turing. I took  a lot of notes on this one and hope to be more self aware to be able to recognize when I'm buring myself out. 

#### Strengths & Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This was a tough one for me. As I've mentioned to my instructers this session happened to fall on the exact date of a particularly traumatic experience for me. But, tellin my story is imperative to my success and gainging empathy from those who are listening. I've learned that it doesn't help to shy away from difficult topics of my history, and I need to be more willing to share that with others. 

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This was a quite powerful session for me. The video was intriguing but my interactions with a fellow classmate were hugely eye opening for me. She felt as though I had dismissed her that very morning before this session. I was stunned to hear this and every fiber of my being wanted to refute this. Alas, I have to accept that despite my intentions and my interpretation, someone elses feelings in interactions with me are out of my control. I have to accept the possibility that I may in fact have some micro biases in my behavior born out of who knows what. This is something that is now on my radar and I will most definitely attempt to mitigate any interactions where I might appear to be dismissive of someone. It will be quite the challenge and one that I hope I can honestly face. 

#### Case Study with Mod 4

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/Programming-languages-gearup)

This case study was all about learning programming languages. Mod 4ers brought us through an interesting discussion about programming languages as a whole. They opened up two mythical creature testing setups and went step by step through them with both Ruby and Javascript programming languages. It was eye openeing to see just how similar the were! It made me realize that OOP in general is more of a philosophy than a specific language. It gave me hope that in the future I will be able to jump into and begin understanding most any programming language I want to learn. We also had a lively Q/A with the mod 4 people, discussing their resumes and job prospects. This was a fun session to participate in. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As mod 1 person, I'm not sure how much I was able to contribute to the environment other than simply interacting with my fellow Turing students. I enjoy going to talks and demo's here and the community vibe at turing is amazing. I cannot wait until I feel confident enough to lead some discussions with other mods and to interact with and help other out. When I first arrived at Turing I didn't know what to expect. It was an intimidating experience to walk into Clarke Hall and to see so many people who were friendly with one another and seemingly long friends. I naturally took a seat towards the back in an empty row. A group of Mod 2ers came walking in and asked if they could sit next to me. They sat all around me and to my surprise at the time, they immediately introduced themselves to me and started chatting me up. It was maybe the best introduction to Turing that I could have had. Ever since then I've been continually impressed with the community here and cannot wait to be able to provide that same experience to newcomers, as it can be quite intimidating to walk into this basement. I've been making it a point to smile and say hello to peole I see waiting nervously for their interviews. I hope to carry that attitude with me throughout all of my interactions in life. 

------------------

## Final Review

Well, I wasn't sure what to expect with Turing. I cannot express how impressed I am with this bootcamp and it's environment. Content and class structure aside, the rest of the program has made it apparent that Turing is an extremely well thought out system. It's tough, but fair. That is was ultimately will provide us with the best base to potentially land a job after we're done. I'm hopeful that I made it through Mod 1. I'm acutely aware of how poorly I performed on my DOM evaluation. I'm certain however that my poor performance was more attributable to performance anxiety than not knowing the subjects. We will see how the instructors feel about it, as ultimately it's their input that matters. The worst scenario I could imagine here at Turing, would be to be in a mod where it's clear that I'm holding my fellow classmates back from progressing and learning. Outside of that, I absolutely love coming to this basement. The atmosphere is amicable and the potential I see all around me is truly inspiring.
