# Ricardo Viera - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal was to finish M3 with a completed 'Final' project. I also sought to refine my understanding of React, Redux and Vanilla JS in general.

## A: End of Module Assessment

It was great to finally have a chance to revisit and to regroup while at Turing. This allowed me to set aside my doubts and fears enough to where I could absorb substantially more info and concepts that been blurry for me when I first encountered them. It dramatically illustrated how much fear can hinder the learning process as it seems to be the one thing missing from the equation for me this time around. Helping 1711 in their own projects showed me just how far I've actually progressed in my understanding of JS fundamentals. My confidence has never been higher while at Turing. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this Mod were Swapi-Box 2.0 and my personal project Refuge

#### Swapi-Box

* [Swapi-Box 2.0](https://github.com/rvwatch/Swapi-Box-2.0)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Tapping into a Star-Wars api.. Challenge was to build out a custom interface to display info that has been gathered from the Swapi.co database.

#### Refuge

* [Refuge](https://github.com/rvwatch/Refuge)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Having suffered from PTSD triggered panic attacks, this project carries a deep personal motivation for me. I discovered strategies to capture a stimulus or thought before it might send me spiraling into a panic attack. I'm hoping to provide users with the tools and insights to discover similar stimulus that might cause an attack. Once you can recognize the causes, you stand a chance at preventing them. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were Headcount and Movie-Tracker

#### Head-Count 2.0

* [HeadCount](https://github.com/Kc2693/headcount)
* [Project Specs](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This was a react project where we rendered school data across cards an also compared the data from each card. This was our first real introduction to cleaning data and building out new objects to use within our React architecture.

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL][https://github.com/NatBee/headcount2.0]()
* [Project Specs][https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0]()

A project of first. This was our first use of a back-end within our projects. It was also our first major implementation of the Redux store. It was also our first 3 person project. That in an of itself posed some very interesting interactions and challenges to overcome. I found myself needing to take over as group lead in order to keep things moving forward.

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This was an interesting topic that illuminated the possibility of micro-aggressions being much more sub surface than I had anticipated. I will try to be more aware of scenarios where my ideas or actions have not yet been filtered by an awareness of whom I might be disregarding. 

#### Group Thing

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)

 

#### YOUR SPECIFIC MOD 4-LED GEAR UP GOES HERE && FOLLOW & CHANGE URL BELOW

* [Fake News](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023)

Discussions about Fake news and it's effects on society at large. We played a fake news identification game. We then had group talks about ways it could possibly be mitigated and what things we can do to combat it. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I worked more closely with the 1711 class this mod. I worked with several M2 students on their JS fundamentals and what actually is happening in their code. I also participated in a 'Stress at Turing' discussion where I was asked to give feedback about life at Turing as a parent. I also joing a 'Go-Code' colorado group with students from the back-end program, but unfortunately many of us weren't able to participate as a result of it being scheduled during finals week.
