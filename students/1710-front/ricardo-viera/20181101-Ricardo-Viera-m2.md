# Ricardo Viera - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This mod I hoped to reach out more often to my fellow classmates and also to Mod 1 students to help solidify my JS fundamentals. I also hoped to participate in more Turing groups outside of class projects. I was excited to learn about the fundamentals of the broader CS topics in general and I assume everyone gets excited to build their own game. I wanted to solidify the thought that I'm capable of thinking like a true programmer as I've always accepted myself as having a more of a creative mind than a logical one. I wanted to become more aware of my improvements in programming as I can be a bit too hard on myself. I also hoped to become more comfortable coding in front of others as I tend to spiral down an overthinking rabbit hole when someone is watching me live code.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Mod 2 was a wake-up call that I need to get disciplined with my timing or I'm destined for failure. During mod 1 it was clear that earlier cohorts were impressed that I was attempting Turing with a 6-month-old at home. I didn't understand why that was such a common reaction. I quickly discovered why when I entered Mod 2. Towards the end, I felt as though I were attempting to read war and peace, while simultaneously cooking dinner while holding my daughter while talking to my mother while responding to an email, while all the smoke detectors in my house were blaring... Keeping things organized became a struggle, to say the least. That being said, over-all I enjoyed the projects in this session and felt like I made a ton of progress. Array prototypes were unfortunately put on the back burner as a result of timing and that ended up rearing its ugly head for me during the Evals. Not to mention my insane performance anxiety when it comes to coding in front of instructors. Bottom line is that I simply struggled with finding the time to put consistent reps on Array Prototypes and bracket notation. Outside of those, I thoroughly enjoyed bringing actual projects to life! Game time was a pleasure to work on and really began to drive home the fundamentals of Mod 1 for me. Weatherly was a great intro to react's component structure and rendering speeds. At first, I didn't fully understand why it was considered so useful. Happily, I've learned why. I also feel as though I really flourish in paired projects in general. Overall, I think I'd be just fine in Mod 3 and would not hold my partners back in any way shape or form. While I did enjoy Mod 2, I'm not convinced repeating it will solidify my understanding of array prototypes. I think finding the time for practice reps will bring me up to speed. I'm hoping to have time on the break to really nail down bracket notation and refine my often rudimentary approach to array prototypes. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had several invidividual projects this Mod. 
They were Sorting Suite, Complete Me and React Static Comp

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were given to paired projects this module. 
Those were Game Time and Weatherly. 

## (GameTime)

* [GameTime URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/RV-game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This was a project I definitely looked forward to. We finally built a real-world project and one that people enjoy using! I was able to see why mythical creatures and understanding those fundamentals were such an important part of mod 1. Building out the class structures and extending those objects was extremely intriguing and eye-opening to what is possible. ES6 was refreshing to learn and watching the game come to life was so much fun. Nora and I got along too well. We'd often lost track of time and focus, but we managed to bring it back together to complete the project. I felt as though Game-time really helped solidify many of the concepts we were introduced to in mod 1.

## (Weathrly)

Such a great project to introduce React with! Understanding how the states worked and how React can render elements on the fly was amazing and mind-blowing. I cannot wait to build out more projects using React. I was surprised at how quickly I felt comfortable with the React workflow and understanding how files and objects communicate with one another. Watching the app return real-world data for the first time was such a cool experience. I must have spent 30 minutes looking up weather forecasts for random cities... I really tried to improve my bad habits with poor naming conventions with this one. Nyssa may disagree, but I felt it was a marked improvement on my normally chaotic naming issues.

#### Community Gearup - Transforming your Narrative through Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_8.md)

This was a great session that opened my eyes a bit more to the true fixed mindset problems I've been dealing with. Comparing myself to others definitely popped up on my radar as an issue I need to deal with while here at Turing. Also, realizing that everyone else around me is likely dealing with their own fixed mindset issues is something worth recognizing. I'd like to continue to be cognizant of my own fixed mindset triggers from here on out and will hopefully develop some strategies to help mitigate them when those thoughts inevitably rear their ugly heads. 

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This was an intriguing session that brought up some ideas about what draws our attention that we are no normally aware of. Some great solutions for managing your own attention economy were shared and I even downloaded a few apps to hopefully help me deal with my tendency towards distraction. After running the app, I immediately attempted to open my phone again and was met with the message that I need to turn it off. This is a great asset to me during the few moments in the morning that I get to spend with my daughter. I cannot fully express how important that time is to me and I use that app to make sure I don't peak at my phone while I'm with her. 

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

Another interesting topic broached by Turing that was both unexpected and enjoyable. Being able to speak candidly with some of my classmates about these topics, really helped give me a deeper insight into their background stories and the influences truly at work in their lives. Also, being able to express some perspectives on my own life that others hadn't considered generated some interesting responses.   


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During my mod 1 portfolio review, I mentioned that for the first few moments at Turing I was approached by and introduced to several students in the mod 2 program and that it had a huge impact on my day. I made it a point to try and do the same for some fresh mod 1 students who had just arrived at Turing. I also made it a point to stop and chat with mod 1 students and to work with them on projects whenever I had the chance throughout mod 2. During this Mod, I also discovered and joined the Pahlka group and helped contribute to some ideas on projects that are being built. It's encouraging to see classmates so passionate about building apps that might impact our communities. I was also asked to help critique and give insights into a Mod 3 project that is centered around space! It reignited the many ideas I have for apps focused on my most favorite subject. I look forward to becoming more and more a part of the Turing community during mod 3.
