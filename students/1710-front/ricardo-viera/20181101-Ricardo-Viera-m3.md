## A: End of Module Assessment

Failed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this Mod were Swapi-Box and my personal project G-Wolf

#### Swapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/SwapiBox)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This was a React project based around creating fetch calls to pull in the Star Wars API data and rendering it across multiple pages. 

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1710/mod-3/swapi/ricardo-viera/scores.md()

#### G-Wolf

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/rvwatch/g-wolf()
* [Project Specs]http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html()

This was a personal project built around the idea of tracking the game scores of a golf game digitally that would ideally automatically score and distribute points to the players. 

G-Wolf Evaluation
FAILED!!!!!!!! DNF (Did not finish)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were Headcount and Movie-Tracker

#### Head-Count 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NatBee/headcount2.0)
* [Project Specs](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This was a react project where we rendered school data across cards an also compared the data from each card. This was our first real introduction to cleaning data and building out new objects to use within our React architecture. 

[Eval](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1710/mod-3/headcount/ricardo-natalie/scores.md)

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL][https://github.com/NatBee/headcount2.0]()
* [Project Specs][https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0]()

A project of first. This was our first use of a backend within our projects. It was also our first major implimentation of the Redux store. It was also our first 3 person project. That in an of itself posed some very interesting interactions and challenges to overcome. I found myself needing to take over as group lead in order to keep things moving forward.

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This was an interesting topic that illuminated the possibility of micro-aggressions being much more sub surface than I had anticiapted. I will try to be more aware of scenarios where my ideas or actions have not yet been filtered by an awareness of whom I might be disregarding. 

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

We encountered an interesting interactive website that illustrated how a lack of diversity can create a self-filtering community that quickly becomes segragated from many aspects of society. We also discussed the ramifications of allowing such a scenario to take place and how it might specifically be a detriment to your real world products. 

#### YOUR SPECIFIC MOD 4-LED GEAR UP GOES HERE && FOLLOW & CHANGE URL BELOW

* [Relaxation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_3.md)

We discussed and shared many techniques/activities that Turing students are participating in, in order to mitagate the effects of stress. There were many insights that I will be attempting to incorporate into my Turing life. For example, taking 10 minutes a day to listen through a head space meditation session. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I worked with many of the Mod-1 and Mod-2 FE students on their static comps and their html/css structures / ideas in general. I've worked with several classmates on refining their UI/UX implimentation on their projects. In general I try to make myself available to anyone who needs help.
