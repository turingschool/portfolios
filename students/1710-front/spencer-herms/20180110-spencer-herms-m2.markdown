## A: End of Module Assessment
 
## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
For this module my solo projects were Sorting Suite, CompleteMe and Weatherly.
 

### Sorting Suite
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/sorting-suite

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html
 
Sorting suite introduced us to the basic computer science concepts of sorting algorithms. We went over the history, strengths and limitations of various algorithms. We also went over algorithm performance and the concept of big O.

### Complete Me
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/complete-me
 
Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html

Complete me introduced the students too different data structures including binary tries, linked list and  prefix tries.  Students build their own tries which functioned as an autocomplete for an input.  The project was then packaged and imported to later projects.

### Weathrly

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/weatherly

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html
 
Weathrly introduced the React framework, API calls as well as the Jest and Enzyme testing frameworks.

## Comments:

### Specification Adherence

score: 3++

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.


### Testing

score: 3++

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints


### Group Work & Projects
 
This module's paired project was Game Time.
 
## Game Time
 
GitHub URL: https://github.com/goodalls/game-time

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Game Time was our first venture in HTML canvas and using ES6 concepts. In Game Time we made extensive use of classes and wrote robust testing suites. 
 

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time

## Comments:

### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


## D: Professional Skills
 
This module gave us the opportunity to further develop our ability to work in teams in addition to contributing to the broader Turing community. Some of my reflections from this mod can be found here: https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1708-f/spencer_herms.md).

## E: Community Participation
 
### Playing a Part
 
Thought this mode I partook in the Turning community as much as possible.  I attended many events and showed my partner and I’s Game Time project in the code fair.   I made myself available each day at lunch during the first 4 weeks of the mod for pairing sessions.  I made an effort to help others and answer questions whenever I could.
