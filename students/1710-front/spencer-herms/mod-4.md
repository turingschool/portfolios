# Mod-4 Spencer Herms

[30 Day Action Plan](https://gist.github.com/PreciseSlice/c0d575915b9f21ae5dcdb06042b64ce0)

## Achievement  

I have now successfully completed the program at Turing. This is a massive achievement which took an enormous amount of effort. The idea of working as a software engineer has intrigued me for years. Growing up I was enthralled with computers and electronics and always sought to know more about how they worked. I would constantly tinker with the PC I built and any other electronic in the house. When I was a teenager I bought a salvage 1971 Volkswagen Beetle from a junkyard. I spent countless hours restoring this vehicle back to road worthy condition. At the timer I also owned a 1986 Chevrolet Caprice, whichever was less broken I drove. Many hours in the garage made me understand the importance of interconnected modular components and troubleshooting.

I chose a path of culinary arts and worked in kitchens for many years. I enjoyed the creativity, the science behind technique and experimenting to make delicious flavors. I did not enjoy the meager pay, physical toll and very long hours. I then wound up getting a job at finance company and working my way up from customer service and data entry to becoming a commercial underwriter. I enjoyed the analytics of this job a great deal. I began to see many processes which were once manual become automated. This piqued my interest once more and I decided I should learn to code. After a couple years of dabbling and searching I found Turing. Once doing some research I knew Turing was exactly what I had been searching for, I resigned from my job and enrolled.

This module I set out to learn much more about servers and API's as well as to feel prepared for the job search ahead of me. These goals were accomplished in this module. I spent time improving my resume and past projects, while also learning best practices for the job seeking and application process. Learning how to build APIâ€™s and databases was very interesting to me. I was very glad to round out my knowledge of the request response cycle and to now know what takes place server side when a fetch call is made.

This module I also became even closer to my classmates and set out to help students in the modules below whenever possible. I enjoyed collaborating with peers and explaining concepts to others.

I enjoyed revisiting building frontend projects without using the React library. My jQuery was a bit weak when I first picked it back up. I strived to ensure I knew how to manipulate elements on the DOM using both jQuery and plain JavaScript. My understanding of the DOM has greatly increased when using React in mod 3. I enjoyed increasing and applying that knowledge in different libraries and frameworks.

I now feel I have learned to pick up new technologies quickly. I have become an advanced Googler and document reader. Learning how to quickly find and process relevant information needed to move forward is very empowering. I am now inspired to move forward and continue learning indefinitely.

## Struggle 

A struggle this module was deciding how to spend my time during the last six weeks. Should I focus on learning the new technologies being presented to me or should I be diving into the job search headfirst? I ultimately decided to focus on learning and hit the job hunt full time on 4/23. That being said, I took steps to ensure I was prepared for my job hunt.

During this module I made sure to take care of my health and avoid setbacks. I made an effort to use my time efficiently and to not become exhausted. Getting sick in a prior module and not taking the time to recover was a lesson learned.  

## Server side 

As I touched on earlier, I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about databases and API's. Before this module the server side seemed to be a mysterious and very separate sphere of knowledge. This module enabled me to understand what was happening when a request is made to the server.

I want to continue to expand my knowledge of databases and server side development. Ideally, I would like to be able to work as a full stack developer as I enjoy both areas. I would be open to working on either side of the stack. Wherever I end up once I get in the door I will be pushing to work with teams on both sides, even if it is just helping out or shadowing. I will continue to constantly expand my knowledge.      

## Acquired Skill  

The most important skill I learned from Turing is the ability to quickly pick up new languages, libraries and frameworks. As I spoke to previously, knowing how to quickly find and apply relevant information to solve the issue at hand is an invaluable skill. This skill coupled with the fundamental principles of programming, which are consistent across languages, libraries and frameworks has empowered me to move into the career field which has interested me for some time.
