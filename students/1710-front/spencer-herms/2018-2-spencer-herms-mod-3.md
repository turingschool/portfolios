# Spencer Herms - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out too greatly expand my knowledge of React, to learn the Redux framework and to get more experience with API’s. I also wanted spend many more hours improving developer skills and continuing to grow with my cohort. I have accomplished these goals. Throughout the module I pushed myself each day to accomplish and learn as much as possible. The extreme amount of effort required and has caused me to become a better developer.

### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PreciseSlice/swapi-box.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

### Evaluation: 

### Evaluator: Christie 
### Students: Spencer

### Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


### Blend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PreciseSlice/flavor-affinity.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.

A good project idea should:

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j25bender/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)


This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

### Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

- 3- - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3+ - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up


#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

I found the micro-aggression gear-up to be extremely enlightening. Hearing my classmates experiences I was very eye opening. Raising awareness on this topic is very important.  Since this gear-up I have made an effort to be aware of my choice of words and how they may impact others.  


#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
  
The Tragedy of the Commons gear-up was very informative.  We need to be aware that small biases across a large group can add up to a very large societal problems.  As individuals we need to make choices which will work to correct these biases. Institutions should strive to make policy which remedies these issues.    


#### What's your favorite flavor of shit sandwich (and does it come with an olive?)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_6.md)

In this gear-up the pros and cons of start-ups, mid-size corporations and large corporations was outlined.  It was informative to go over the pros and cons of each with the upcoming job search.  Finding the right cultural fit can have a major impact on an employees success and satisfaction with their job.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I made an effort to contribute to the Turing community this module.  I paired with three groups of module two students multiple times while the groups where working on their game time projects. I made an effort to help other in the class and an answer questions when they arose.  I also often answered questions in the 1710 private channel and wrote gist to guide other students through problems.  I often answered questions to help students in mod 1 and 2 when they looked liked they needed help. I assisted the mod 1 students in my posse with their projects.  I also made an effort to clean up around the facility when I see the opportunity to do so.
