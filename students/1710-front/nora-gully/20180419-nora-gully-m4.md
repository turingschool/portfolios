# Mod 4 Portfolio

### Mod 4 Projects: 
* Palette Picker
* Pattrn Party
* Build Your Own Backend
* Historic Denver / Capstone Project

### Struggle
I initially struggled with our first project, Palette Picker. It was the first time I built a server from scratch and knew what every part of it was doing. It was interesting to be able to capture user input and have it persist in a database for the very first time. After I got over the hill of that project, I was in a better position to take on all the other projects this quarter. 

### Achievements
My biggest achievement this module was my capstone project, *Historic Denver*, because it is the most sophisticated project I have done by far. I took the opportunity to create a back end for this project during another assignment, Build Your Own Backend (BYOB), so my capstone project is really the combination of both. 

*Historic Denver* uses public data from the City of Denver to locate all the buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. We then used Mapbox GL to map all of those places on a 3D relief of the city. We also aggregated information about all of those buildings, including photos, using webscraping. 

I was happy to finally be creating a narrative with content like maps and data, because I would like to do more of that kind of work in the future. 

### Standing Out 
One way I stand out from my peers is that I know the value of a good story. I wanted to learn to code so that I could make engaging interactive experiences that will help help communicate worthwhile ideas to a broader public. My personal projects, *Gazetter* and *Historic Denver*, each connect people with a wider world, be it news or the history of their city. Beyond the technologies I've learned, I am interested in educating a larger public about social issues and even using technology to change the world. 

This skill of storytelling also means that I am a great public speaker and that I can express technical ideas clearly and thoughtfully. I believe that my this clarity of thought, coupled with my engaging and friendly manner, will make me a good technical lead some day. 

### Back-end Pivot
I enjoyed getting to work with back-end technologies this term. I think that it increased my understanding of the inner workings of all kinds of websites, especially those with user-generated content. 

I also have a sincere love of data. I absolutely plan to learn more about ways to obtain public data and visualize it for the public good. 

### Takeaways
Turing has showed me that I can teach myself anything. Coming from the world of film and journalism, I think I had some misconceptions about my technical chops and a good bit of imposter syndrome to boot. But now, I realized that I can dive into any framework, dataset, programming language, library or project and be able to figure it out. I will absolutely bring this renewed confidence in my own ability to my next job.
