## A: End of Module Assessment

I did well this mod. I felt challenged because our partner projects were complex and actually useful. I also enjoyed the more theoretical problems such as the search and sorting algorithms. Between these two areas, I really started to enjoy Javascript. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During Mod2 at Turing, my individual projects were *Complete-Me*, *Sorting-Suite*, and the *React Static Comp*. 

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project I had to write my own sorting algorithms for bubble-sort, insert-sort, merge-sort and quick/pivot-sort in Javascript. Each algorithm sorts an array of numbers in ascending order. In order to test these functions I implemented an entire testing suite with Mocha and Chai.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project required me to implement a prefix trie data structure in Javascript. I populated a trie with a dictionary via a populate() method and then implemented an autocomplete feature, called suggest(). This was a series of recursive functions that returned an array of words based on how popular they were. To see what I was doing, I also completed a testing suite with Mocha and Chai. I also bundled this project into an NPM package that could be installed later as a dependency.

- Pass

## React Static Comp

* [GitHub URL](https://nogully.github.io/ng-react-static-comp/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project, I had to mimic the layout of the website Medium using the React framework for Javascript. This was a relatively painless assignment that was meant to introduce us to the modularity of React components and how to style them with CSS. 

**Evaluation Scores**
- Pass

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our partner projects this mod were *GameTime* and *Weathrly*.

## GameTime

* [Game URL](https://rvwatch.github.io/RV-game-time/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rvwatch/RV-game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

My partner and I created an imitation of the game Frogger using only Javascript and HTML Canvas (no libraries). We also employed a testing suite with Mocha and Chai to check every outcome. This was an intense project where I learned a lot about how objects communicate and manipulate one another's methods. We did not prioritize graphics and styling, but we had a fully playable game that got harder as you went along. This was also the first time that we used a linter, which helped us make cleaner code.

**Evaluator: Leta**

**Evaluation Comments**
- Original inheritance was shaky; nice job refactoring!
- Logic living in odd places (Frogger controlling game score, etc)
- A few areas where code could be DRYd up by leveraging parameters
- Nice work overall

**Evaluation Scores**
- Functional Expectations: *3*
- User Interface: *3+*
- Testing: *3+*
- JavaScript Style: *3*
- Workflow: *4*
- Code Sanitation: *4*

## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

My partner and I made a weather forecasting app using React JS and the Weather Underground API. This was a fun project because it was our first one in React and our first time doing an API call. We also implemented a killer testing suite using Jest and Enzyme. 

**Evaluator: Leta**

**Evaluation Comments**
- Opportunity to refactor so that you're passing the whole current weather object to the Current component using destructuring syntax
- Run the clean() function for your API data in your getWeather() method so you start with clean data
- Current and Card components could be stateless (but this is a matter of philosophy)

**Evaluation Scores**
- Specification Adherance: *3++*
- User Interface: *3+*
- CSS/Sass Style: *3++*
- JavaScript Style: *3++*
- Testing: *4*
- Workflow: *4*
- Code Sanitation: *4*

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Ups
#### Empathy and Privilege

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I was grateful for this session because although I typically think of myself as 'woke', this session helped me identify privileges I (and many others) typically take for granted, including 'not having addictions' 'being healthy', 'being from a 2-parent household', 'having studied the culture of my ancestors in school', 'not being a survivor of sexual abuse', and 'not thinking twice about calling the police'. I think I came away with a renewed sense of empathy for the diverse students at Turing and a greater sense of responsibility for our unique community.


#### The Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This session was about the concept that attention is a commodity and that being able to capture the attention of users is the new currency in tech. This brought about two major areas of discussion: 1) that we, as technologists, have to tread very carefully when it comes to our users, because we can actually abuse our ability to monopolize their attention. Technology addiction is real and we want our users to not be annoyed by or hurt by the consumption of our products. 2) is that each of us should be mindful of our use of technology and limit the notifications and attention-seeking methods of these apps as much as possible. I think I do pretty well on both of these fronts but will stay vigilant.  


#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4) : Just because you can, doesn't mean you should

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_6.md)

In this session, we talked about the recent controversy over whether Apple should create a 'backdoor' in its encryption of user data for law enforcement to exploit. The example in question was the terrorist attack in San Bernadino and the POIâ€™s iPhone. Overall, I think most of the group agreed with Apple, in that it would set a dangerous precedent for the government to be able to access encrypted user data. Technology has become a more intimate part of people's lives than ever before, and as developers, we handle a lot of sensitive information. We need to take this responsibility seriously, both because of the 4th Amendment and also because users would no longer use our products if they knew that we were allowing this kind of breach. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I am very community-minded and I did my best to participate at Turing on every level. 
- 1710 Cohort: I have always been available for my peers when they need to talk and vent. I am pretty confident in my learning so I always offer to teach people and never turn down a request for help. 
- Front End: I organized the tutoring sessions for FEE Mod 1 to help them work on their Mythical Creatures assignment. I also reminded my class to offer up pairing sessions for Mod 1. I did a good amount of pairing myself and offered my support to many individually.  
- Wozniak Posse: Our posse basically became an opportunity for cross-mod socialization. I understand that the posse structure is changing next inning and am looking forward to joining one based on interest, like Pahlka/Civic Tech. 
- Student Groups: I went to most of the Joan Clarke Society sessions this mod and was excited to meet badass alumnae. I got some really great suggestions about mentors, jobs and opporunities, which was great.
- Administration: Lastly, I took time to give feedback to Ellen Mary about the lack of student privacy with respect to Professional Development deliverables on GitHub. She heard me out, and as a result, she took the entire PD repo off of GitHub and will no longer let instructors require feedback in our portfolios.
