# Nora Gully - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing not having done any coding before, so I think that for a complete beginner, I did great. I have a background in creative applications and design so I was most comfortable with HTML/CSS. Learning Javascript was my greatest challenge and I think I came a long way. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I don't know the final scores yet, but I think that I passed. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During Mod 1 at Turing, my required individual projects were *Number Guesser* and *Static Comps 1-3*. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For our first project, we made a game where you guess numbers. This was my first foray into DOM manipulation and my Javascript was definitely at a beginner level. I struggled with this assignment but fulfilled all the requirements. Also I had fun adding rainbow unicorns when you win the game. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- break out single responsibility functions
- JS is in a good place for a refactor pass
- overall, make sure you're mindful of small details like spacing, indentation, and DRY code.
- it is great that you're comfortable trying things out and experimenting. Make sure you give yourself a little time to tidy things up and really understand how all the parts work together, too.
- yay unicorns!

**Evaluation Scores**
- Functional Expectations: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- Comp Recreation/Design: Advanced Beginner
- HTML: Advanced Beginner
- CSS: Advanced Beginner
- JS/JQ: Advanced Beginner
- Surprise and Delight: Unicorn Rainbows

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/ng-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first comp recreation assignment, I chose a theme of 'robot takeover'. The assignment involved creating a web layout that is responsive in mobile using Flexbox. I struggled using Flexbox for the first time, but I think that overall my choice of color, fonts, icons and sizes were sound. I chose a different mobile solution than a lot of students but I think it worked well. I ran out of time to fix some things but learned a lot. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- some squirelliness in transition to mobile!
- mobile buttons too small for fat fingers
- contrast is not great when buttons are reoriented in Flexbox
- try narrow on big screen and squish from bottom
- nice color palette with photo
- size of icons with respect to boxes is nice
- missing slideshow buttons

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/ng-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Our second comp critique was scheduled the day of Halloween 2017, so I knew that I would be dressed as Medusa (fitting with our class theme of Mythical Creatures). As a tie-in, I decided to make my static comp about Medusa's victims - the people she 'stoned'. I had a lot of fun with it. I also felt way more comfortable with Flexbox and the transition from desktop to mobile layouts. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- you're funny! 
- missing hover states
- make sure text on top is really centered
- when you squish, things shouldn't move/jump upwards
- admin logo is really squished
- overall nice color choices
- make sure things are centered when you switch to mobile
- red on gray is a dicey choice
- not enough contrast with text on photos

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/ng-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

For our third static comp assignment, I tried my best to recreate the assignment based on the original design. I did switch out some of the copy and photos with the world-famous Doge, but otherwise I stuck to the corporate theme because the copy and purpose of the website were somewhat unintelligible. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- you're funny! 
- overall nice job
- watch your margins, some fine-tuning esp. on icons
- table could have been reordered column-wise
- don't name classes after their tag
- bring back the circles! 
- some elements crowded in mobile, like button
- don't specify height for things
- could use more color, like on hover states
- some squirrelliness in your media queries, transition from desktop to tablet should happen sooner

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Mod 1 at Turing, my required group work and pairing projects were *Linked List*, *Idea Box*, and *2DoBox Pivot*.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

**Evaluator: David**

**Evaluation Comments**
- Pay more attention to detail on comp
- USE FORMS!!!!!!! Inputs should have labels!!!
- Html style is pretty solid
- Could use some organizational comments in css
- Consider using inline blocks instead of position absolute for desktop breakpoint
- Seeing hex and rgba values for colors - pick one or the other
- Check for duplicate lines in CSS and break out into class if possible
- Be weary when using large ternaries
- Comments seem unnecessary/redundant
- Great job naming functions
- Try to only use global vars when absolutely necessary
- Be more consistent with spacing, indentation, and semicolons
- Tell more of a story with commit messages, but love that I'm seeing a lot of commits

>Feedback from Bruce: Enjoyed working with you! We improved and learned a lot on GitHub as a pair.  I think we had a good workflow and communicated well and the project went very smoothly.  I was relieved to have you work on the CSS with me.  I think it would be helpful to keep asking your partner questions when you get stuck so the two of you can work through problems together.  Good work and keep it up!

#### IdeaBox

**Evaluator: David**

**Evaluation Comments**
- Love that y'all hosted the project on github and that you have a readme
- Intermediate breakpoints had some weird behavior where it would get smaller and then bigger again
- Think of sad cases ie. user tries to submit an idea without a title and/or body.
- Generally really good HTML style in terms of indentations, but avoid inline styles!
- Consider adding a typography section 
- Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces
- Work on passing objects instead of object properties
- Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card
- Work on being consistent with spacing and tabbing with conditional blocks and functions
- Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
- Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

>Feedback from Michelle: I had a really great time working with you! I like that we tried to figure out JS issues together before asking for help. Then, you were great about helping me understand problems once we figured them out. Thank you for setting up the pairings with Mod 2 during the project!

#### 2doBox

**Evaluation Comments**
- good use of Github
- worked well together! Clearly both own the codebase and can speak to it.
- CSS has opportunities for further refactoring, especially with media queries
- loved that they had a "most proud of" refactored function to talk about
- Solid choices and clear strategy for approaching the refactor.
- Good work! Nicely done.

>Feedback from Nyssa: A couple times, I felt like my ideas weren't being heard. If you know from the start that one of my ideas wouldn't work, it would have been helpful for me if you explained to me why they wouldn't work. However, I really enjoyed working with you! I feel like I was able to learn a lot because we did most of the project together. I appreciate how you were explaining things to me as you were doing them and how you always made sure I was following you. 

## D: Professional Skills

I sent my PD deliverables to Allison directly because I consider them private.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset (Week 1)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This session featured the video by Carol Dweck about learning with a "growth mindset" instead of a "fixed" mindset. I see the difference now and it has helped me a lot. Instead of seeing challenges as impossible, it helps to think of them as opportunities to improve. Especially in an environment like Turing, it's important to think of the hard problems as fun to figure out instead of boring awful roadblocks. The phrase she used that I really like is "I don't know that... YET!" 

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts! (Week 2)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I appreciated the idea of this lesson, which was that we all have different ways that we communicate and that we should be aware of how best to reach people we are paired with. I thought that some of the ideas introduced were a little stereotypical though. I personally identify as something of an ambivert - an introvert that is able to adapt and be more extroverted in social situations (like among other introverts). Seeing how my peers identified was eye-opening and helped me approach how to interact with them in the long run. 

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things (Week 3)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I really loved the essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates, where he described how hard it is to learn French but that he celebrates the small successes each day. I feel the same way about coding - it takes practice and you have to be faithful to the process and recognize your wins. Otherwise it feels like a slog and you will never get there. If you can immerse yourself in the process, at some point you can look up and think, "look how far I have come!"

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap (Week 5)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This documentary film definitely hit home for me in that I have been working as a woman in a technical field for a number of years. I learned the term "stereotype threat", which I feel is on par with imposter syndrome as a good way to describe the persistent feeling that you will live up to a bad gender stereotype, like women being "bad at math". I really loved EllenMary's facilitating and how she highlighted our cohort's gender diversity and how we, maybe more than other cohorts, are in the process of tipping the scales of gender representation.


#### Community Gear Up: Social Movements in Tech (Week 5)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1710-inning/group_four.md)

This Gear Up was run by Mod 4 and it was really interesting. After an orientation to examples of social movements that are enabled by communities of coders (i.e. Bernie), the Mod 4 students led us through reflections where we came up with a social issue we were passionate about, what the sides were in that issue, what solutions have been tried, and how we could potentially attack that social issue using tech. We then broke into small groups and discussed our ideas and what committments we could make towards making them happen. I think the best part of this Gear Up was the fact that it made the social justice-minded people at Turing visible to me, and they introduced me to more resources, like the Pahlka Posse. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I am very community-minded and I did my best to participate at Turing on every level. I broke this down by cohort, front-end program, posse, student groups, student body and wider community: 
- 1710 Cohort: I have always been available for my peers when they need to talk and vent. I am pretty confident in my learning so I always offer to teach people and never turn down a request for help. 
- Front End: I have tried to make friends in Mod 2 and pair with as many of them as I can, as I think they are a valuable resource. I am also trying to attend Iron FE as much as possible.
- Posse: I went to all of our Wozniak meetings, which really ran the gamut. Some weeks we did CodeWars and some weeks we just vented because projects were getting intense. Overall I valued having Mod 4 students as mentors and being able to ask them questions. 
- Student/Alumnae Groups: I am part of both the Joan Clarke Society and Pahlka Posse. I hope to be able to devote more bandwidth to them in the future now that I have a better idea of how my Turing workload shakes out week-to-week. 
- Student Body: I gave a Lightning Talk about "Recycling at Turing" in Week 3. I decided to do this topic because I noticed many Turing students doing it wrong. I think it went well because a lot of people came up to me afterwards and thanked me. 
- Community: I attended the talk by Megan Smith, former CTO of the United States, on 10/25/17. It was immensely inspiring and really big-picture. I knew much of the "hidden history of tech", as she called it, but I was surprised by the comparisons she made between our current technological moment and events like Kennedy's moonshot ("we choose to go to the Moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard"). Her sense of mission, ambition and crazy hard work were just awe-inspiring and something I really needed at an otherwise rough day in Week 4. More please! 
- Administration: Lastly, I took time to give feedback to Allison about the lack of student privacy with respect to personal information and how I think Turing could make some improvements. I am happy to discuss this further.
