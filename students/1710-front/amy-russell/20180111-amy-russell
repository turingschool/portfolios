## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel confident in using bracket notation to access information between differnt objects, ES6, React, and most array prototypes. Over break, I plan to continue practicing problems using multiple array prototypes in tandem to access and alter information.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were Sorting-Suite, Complete-Me

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project, I custom coded ways to implement bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project, I worked with a classmate to create an autocomplete feature, populated with the Apple dictionary on my computer.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were GameTime, making a Frogger-like game and Weatherly, weather app.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/frogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Instead of keeping with the Frogger basics, we altered the narrative to center around a Bubble getting popped by sharp objects, or using bubble wands and clouds to float to safety. 

### Evaluator: Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs


#### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.


#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints


## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

With a partner, I created a Weather web app using React. 

### Evaluator: 

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_7.md)

Be Your Own Ally.

In this Gearup, we discussed the difficulties in standing up for yourself when you feel steamrolled or insulted. It can be hard to do so, since you don't want to create drama, or
make anyone feel bad. But at the same time, it's important to stand up for yourself. There's
a way you can do this, while assuming the best intentions from everyone else. Use NVC and 'I'
statements. 

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

The attention economy is a little known phenomena, with enormous impacts on our society. It
explains why I feel nervous if I leave my phone in another room. Why I scroll Instagram for 
a half hour without even noticing. And why so many people text and drive. Our phones are built
for controlling as much of our attention as possible. 

And what is our responsibility, as developers, to address this? I think if we have a stake in 
the matter, ensuring that our business plans are not based on ad sales can help. To create
technology that truly improves people's lives, and doesn't just steal there attention, may
be easier said than done, but is an important goal that I'm committed to.

#### Empathy and Privilege

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

As a whole, I can be more aware of how unseen privileges and disadvantages affect interpersonal
interactions. Everything from a hidden mental illness to someone's background may be unseen
by me, but would contribute to how a person shows up and is treated. I also can be a better 
ally to people with different identities than I have. Examining my inherent biases will always
be important. 


## E: Community Participation
I paired with Mod 1, attend a Joan Clarke Society event, and told more friends about Turing who may be interested in attending.
