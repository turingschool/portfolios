## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Number Guesser 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For this project, we built an app that genereates a random number, takes a user input, and evaluates it against the original number. It also allows the user to input their own range for the number generation

Evaluation Comments:
Be sure that appropriate UI is incorporated so user understands the range for guessing
Good nesting in HTML. Push forward with ARIA
Love your excitement over CSS - keep it up! Good start for organizing stylesheet
Move towards breaking apart functions to make them single responsibility
Be prepared to talk through the technical parts of your code and what that code is doing (e.g. parseInt)

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/ar-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)
This project involved a mockup of a portfolio-type site. We were given no assets, so we had creative freedom with almost everything except the layout. 

Evaluation Comments:
Good colors.
Don't forget your viewport and mobile.

#### Static Comp 2
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/ar-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/amy-r/ar-comp-challenge-2)
This project displayed cards of a profile-like page. Again, we weren't given assets so we had creative freedom. I used grid to align the cards. 

Evaluation Comments:
Good use of grid. 
Work on spacing. Too much margin in between cards.

#### Static Comp 3
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/ar-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
This project involved a complex app layout. I used flex to display most areas of the page.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This Module involved a series of paired projects, each building on each other.

#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amy-r/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

LinkedList took user inputs to create a series of bookmarks. 

Evaluation comments
used a constructor function to create cards! yay objects! awesome!
css and HTML could use a clean up pass
watch indentation
make sure you're taking time to tidy up your code as you go. Details matter, and messy indentation, spacing, and unused lines of code make it look like you aren't being careful about what you're building (even if that isn't the case!)
good job!

Partner Feedback to Me
Amy was an excellent partner. We had very open communication, expectations were clear, work load per person was fairly evenly split, and there were no issues. I think that using waffle/ gitHub more would help split up tasks more easily, so everything can be checked off easier.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox built upon what we learned in LinkedList and added more functionlity to incorporate local storage.

Evaluation comments 
LOVE that you still pushed forward on specs even after the cutoff time for the project.
Comp stays true to spirit of the comp - mobile needs to be tweaked.
Good use of naming in branches and commits!
Remove unnecessary spacing in HTML file. Good naming for classes. Incorporate more ARIA (lang, labels).
Run through CSS selectors w/dev tools to be sure that every line is doing something - 10 declarations that aren't doing anything for the layout (mostly flexbox related)
Good use of a counter to keep track of IDs on cards! Hooray for using $.each in line 27
Opportunities for refactoring: Event listener from lines 50-95 should be refactored into single responsibility functions - too many things are happening here. Make title, body, and quality local variables. Should only need to pull value from input field (for creating object) one time. Once object is created, should only need to pass object as an argument instead of each individual property.

Partner Feedback to Me
The only coaching feedback I have is I feel like both of us should've read the project guidelines a little more carefully so that way we could've done a little more with out project. However, I really enjoyed working with you! I felt like we worked well together because we have similar work styles. I really appreciated how you took time to explain the code you did so that way I was truly able to understand what was happening in our project. I think what we did manage to finish turned out great!

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/2Do-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox Pivot involved refactoring another students IdeaBox and updating it to include more functionality. We also had creative liberty with the UI.

Evaluator comments
Toggle load more and potentially not show if there arent more to load
start text in the non rounded portion of inputs
account for long titles and descriptions
html

forms!!!
css
take a look weirdness going on with height ie. height 103%
some inconsistencies in spacing
could comment up the css more
js
passing around properties when objects should be used instead
Work on naming conventions
Weird syntaxy things
git/github
Could be much more verbose and use bodies in commit messages

Partner Feedback to Me
Amy, this was an awesome experience! As we talked about during our eval, it was my favorite pairing of the mod. You really lifted me up and elevated my game by providing such a beautiful comp for us to go for and really pushed me. It was AWESOME. Our communication was excellent. I was particularly impressed by your ability to "put a cap" on the project and your comfort level, making sure to be kind to yourself while still pursuing a higher level of achievement. Walking through the JS together and ensuring we both understood everything and could effectively explain it was also a highlight. We had an excellent understanding of everything in our project, and why we took the route that we did. As far as coaching points, I encourage you to strive for more on each project. While these final weeks are incredibly stressful, pushing for that last extension or feature amongst all of the chaos will only make you an even more skilled developer and worker. All that said, this was a massively beneficial pairing experience and I earnestly hope we get paired together in the future!

## D: Professional Skills
This Module, we learned about best practices for pairing, personal strengths, and storytelling.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
This was perhaps my favorite of all the Gear Ups, and I really appreciated that it was first. We hear from Caroll Dweck, a psychologist and researcher who looks at the mindsets of successful people. She has found that it is often not those who are naturally talented who end up being the most successful. She has found that people who beleive in their ability to work hard and grow end up being the most successful. 

#### Working Styles
In this GearUp, we explored the differences in working styles among introverts, extroverts and folks that fall in between. I found that I sit nearly in the middle. This gearup gave us a great basis to begin working in pairs. I found that I could easily express how I best work, and my partners could too, so that we could agree on a plan for working ahead of time.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
In this GearUp, we explored the process of working through difficult things. What really stuck with me was a line from Ta Nhesi Coates where he's talking about (faling at) learning French. He says that it's not so much the actual not understanding, or making mistakes that is the difficutl part. It is the feeling of failure that makes it hard. For me, recognizing that it is the emotions attached to failure makes it much easier to push through them. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
This was a relly interesting day in class. We watched a movie that details the problems women face in becoming successful in the technology industry- everything from microaggressions, to assault threats, to systematic discouragement of STEM. We worked through these ideas in small groups and were actually able to discuss a microagression that happened in class earlier that day.

#### Crushing Cold Outrech
This GearUp was awesome! We learned how to find companies on LinkedIn and reach out to set up coffee meetings. Now I have one scheduled with a UI dev at a dream company next week! 

## E: Community Participation
This Mod, I paired with several Mod 2 students and attended every Mythical Creatures session. I also attended all but one health and wellness session (and would highly recomend them!) 

### Playing a Part
I reached out to old friends who may be interested in applying to Turing and encouraged them to apply. I also paired with classmates to help with CSS challenges.
