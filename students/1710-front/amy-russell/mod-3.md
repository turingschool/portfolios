## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Swapibox

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amy-r/swapibox
* [Original Assignment]http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html

Swapibox allowed me to make nested API calls to retreive information about Star Wars characters, and utilize the React library.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amy-r/headcount2.0
* [Original Assignment]https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0

Headcount showcased my ability to use React to conditionally render components based on API calls.

#### Movie Tracker 

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/amy-r/movie-tracker-2
* [Original Assignment]https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker

Movie tracker involved using React, Redux, and Router to create an app that let's user's scroll through a data set of movies and select favorites.

#### Roastr 

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/amy-r/Portafilter
* [Original Assignment]http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html

I wanted to create an application that would improve someone's life. I spend a lot of my time in coffee shops, and wanted to give back, so Jordan 
approached Elle Jenson, a local caf√© owner and asked her detailed questions about her the way her business operates, what her biggest struggles are, 
and how she could foresee technology alleviating some of those headaches. We landed on an application that better organizes her coffees, while
seamlessly communicating with the roasters that sent them. We used React, Redux, Router, and the sendgrid API to automatically fire emails
when a form is filled out.

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown

I really appreciated our class discussion on this. Microaggressions are so prevalent in every day life, but it can be really hard and awkward
to talk about, so it usually gets missed. Additionally, even though it seemed cheesy at first, practicing through how to handle microagressions was
really valuable.

#### Tragedy of the Commons
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
This was one of the more surprising gear-ups yet. I've always known tragedy of the commons to be a phenomenon where if something isn't one
person's responsibility (meaning it's everyone's responsibility), it doesn't get done because there's no accountability or motivation for 
somone to take it on. I never thought about how this translates to creating a diverse society. It was really interesting to see how we all
have the responsibility to surround ourselves with people unlike ourselves, in order to create a better society for us all. 

#### Introvert to Influencer
This gear up was focused on encouraging introverts to break out of shells. We practiced introducing ourselves to people as if we were being
introduced to give a keynote speach. We also learned about power poses, and how they can improve self confidence. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My participation in Turing social events was pretty limited this module, as I was mostly focused on the course material. That said, I 
represented Turing at the EthDen hackathon and won a prize! I used react and redux to create a UI for a solidity smart contract.
