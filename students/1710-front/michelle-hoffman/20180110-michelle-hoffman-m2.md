# Michelle Hoffman - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I really wanted to get better about console logging as I write functions and learning how to tackle issues as they arise.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

I thought this project was very challenging a really rewarding. It actually helped solidify some concepts for array prototypes for me. I enjoyed tackling this project on my own at first, but reached out to classmates when I got stuck. I feel like I learned best by doing this. If I had paired with classmates right away, I believe I would not retain as much information because I would have struggled less. 

#### Evaluator: 

I can't seem to find the grades for sorting suite in the front end submissions folder.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

I took a similar approach to this project as I did for Sorting Suite. Towards the end, Natalie and I teamed up to tackle the suggest method. I think it was awesome that we got to package this module and use it in Weathrly. It's starting to feel like we are creating useful applications. 

#### Evaluator: 

I also cannot find the grades for this project in the submissions folder.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

## GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valentinovtino/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

I really enjoyed this project! The game was a perfect intro to mod 2. I struggled a lot with file structure and think it would have been beneficial to have some guidance there. Overall, this was a great challenge. 

Valentino and I were ecstatic about how it turned out; we've even been discussing an attempt to deploy it to heroku in the future. 

### Evaluator: 

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* score: just barely a 3 - tests are still very weak/not semantic

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

#### JavaScript Style

* score: JUST a 3

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/OphDub/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This was a really challenging project for me. I had a rough time at the beginning of the project since I was sick and I think that hindered me over the week, unfortunately. I learned a lot from it, though, and think React is a very neat tool. Thanks to both of my instructors for working to accomodate me while I could not attend classes. 

### Evaluator: 

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/SCSS Style

* 

#### JavaScript / React Style

* 

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

*



#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_5.md)

I enjoyed this session, but I struggle to define what I came away with from the session. From the title, the material I expected was much different than what we actually went over. I did think the fake news quiz was interesting and a good reminder to always check your sources. 

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This was an awesome session! I'm really interested in the material that we covered and how to tie it to our ethical responsibility as developers. I never would have realized that devs can really have an impact in the attention economy. 

I keep an application on my phone that tracks the amount of time that I spend on it; the number is always surprising and eye-opening. I try to keep my usage below a certain amount of time on most days, so I am really invested in this topic.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This was an eye-opening discussion and I'm glad we did this. I wish we would have had more time to not just acknowledge the priviledges of the few, but talk about how to help those that have disadvantages. It's the first step to acknowledge the problem, but I think a good step after that is to say "Hey, what do we do about this to help elevate our peers?"


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I definitely feel like a more productive member of the Turing community. I had a number of pairings with Mod 1 students. Even if we didn't quite solve their issues I really enjoyed being able to see and interpret someone else's code to try to guide them in the right direction. It really helped me to solidify how I talk about code when I need to explain a concept or learn to say "I don't know" and be okay with figuring it out slowly. 

I felt very invested in the success of the students I paired with and tried to make extra sessions that weren't on my schedule. I always made an effort to follow-up with them after a pairing or evaluation day and liked getting to know some students outside of my class.
