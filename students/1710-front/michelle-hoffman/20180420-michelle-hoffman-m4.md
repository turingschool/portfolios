### Achievements
#### Working with a client

  I'm glad that I had the opportunity to work with a true client. It was kind of poor timing as my client was climbing in Mexico and was unable to communicate beyond the very initial phase of the project. Bruce and I had to do a lot of guess work on features for the capstone and what kind of data to use in our database. 
  
  That being said, I'm really excited to demo the application for her and get some constructive feedback to help make the app more useful for her and her team. There are some features I would still like to implement as well and improving the current features.
  
#### Open Source Contributions

  I really enjoyed working on the House of Vars project. Going into that project, I was nervous about the idea of jumping into a large code base. The idea of beginning a new job was very intimidating to me because I had never tried to work in such a large amount of code. Code that's so unfamiliar. But we were able to easily tackle small issues without getting stuck. That,  alone, made me feel so much better. We even got a chance to tackle an extra issue and both of our pull requests were accepted!
  
  My team got lucky that the stack for that project with extremely similar to the stack that we've been studying at Turing. But even so, I feel a lot more prepared to dive in when I get to work on Tuesday. 

### Struggles
#### Inspiring Motivation & Interpersonal Communication

  One of my biggest struggles this module has been working with partners that were unmotivated. I had a hard time communicating my desire to finish projects and why I thought it was necessary. I haven't experienced that until this mod. I think it has to do with a mixture of the fact that we are so close to being done with school and studying a stack that might not be everyone's first choice. It's definitely not my first choice, either, but I have always valued being well rounded so I enjoyed the material. 
  
  There are a lot of learning opportunities in these situations, though. I know I need to get better communicating my point of view with others that may not have the same priorities. I have a bad habit of assuming the worst and expecting others to be completely unresponsive to my concerns. I also take these things personally and feel that I am being stepped on in a situation like this. 
  
  I recognize that I have a lot of room for improvement in this area. I really want to learn to be better about addressing my concerns without getting too emotionally invested. Also, this kind of situation gives me the opportunity to practice being a team leader. That is something I want to be better at, as well. 

### What Sets Me Apart

  Having a job lined up, I didn't have the pressure to apply to jobs. I think I felt a lot less stress and had more free time than most of my classmates. Because of this, I was able to really take the time to understand the backend. I'm confident that I have a solid understanding of the material that we went over in this last module. 
  
  I also had the opportunity to supplement my learning with studying Ruby and Rails along the way. This is something that I wish was built into the curriculum, but I'm glad I've been able to pursue it in my free time.
  
### My Experience With the Stack

  I had always felt like I wanted to learn the backend. I'm really motivated to create apps and pursue personal projects. The idea of having an application that doesn't need to rely on external api's is really exciting! I want to pursue becoming a full stack developer because it opens up the job market for me in the future. I think it also opens up more opportunities for growth. 

  I said this before, but I've always valued being well-rounded in everything that I do. When I am well-rounded I feel like I am able to adapt better and be a more valuable part of a team. Maybe that has a bit to do with spending 4 years working at a non-profit organization where I've had to do work that wasn't necessarily within the scope of my job description.
  
### Lessons Learned

  I believe the most valuable lesson I've learned at Turing is that a large problem doesn't have to be intimidating. In the past, I've avoided tackling large problems and couldn't get past the feeling of being blocked. This would always eat at me and make me want to avoid it even more. It's a horribly inefficient cycle.  
  
  In learning to code, I've begun to understand that it's easier to tackle big issues when you take the time to truly understand the problem and break it down into bite sized pieces.
  
  I believe this applies to situations outside of programming as well. I've noticed that I'm more inclined to do my research and feel more prepared to tackle issues that I normally would leave for others to take care of. For example, when my car needed a repair, I started researching on my own and watching videos, prepared to fix it on my own. The problem turned out to be a bit more complex than something I could handle without tools, but before Turing I would have just taken it to a mechanic and wouldn't have asked many(if any) questions. 
  
  It's a mindset shift that I've noticed over the last few months that makes me feel more prepared for programming and life in general.
  
### What's Next?
  One of my Strengths Finder themes is Futuristic so I'm adding in this section. I'm enthusiastic about learning some more languages and technologies and pursuing personal projects. Here are a few things I'm planning to do next:
  
  * Learn Rails
  * Experiment with AR/VR programming
  * Practice creating beautiful UI elements by finding inspiration on Dribbble and designing a personal website
  * Experiment with scrollytelling and creating effective animations
  * Expand on my capstone project to create a functional program for a client
