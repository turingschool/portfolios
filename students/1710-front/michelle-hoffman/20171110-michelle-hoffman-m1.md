#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The first project in the front-end program was Number Guesser. I stuggled a TON on this project, but overall I'm really proud of how it came out. I had a hard time asking for help because I felt like I was behind the rest of the class. I didn't have much experience with JavaScript before school started, so it was hard to do this project on my own. That being said, I feel like I learned a lot more by struggling through this one and felt pretty comfortable going into the next project.

##### Evaluation Comments

- Nice job staying true to spirit of comp - minor things to polish
- Watch spacing in HTML file for readability
- Continue incorporating ARIA into markup - hooray!
- Start work towards eliminating redundancy/organizing CSS
- Work on naming in JS. Be ready to speak to what your code is doing/why (e.g. global vs local scope)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These pairing projects were a learning experience for me. I've never had to code with someone, but it was a great experience to be able to work through issues with a project partner. I was nervous about these paired projects at the beginning, but I'm really starting to enjoy them. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JordanPQuinn/linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was the first paired project, so not only did we have to learn how to implement the functionality, but we also had to learn how to pair with other partners. This was a good intro project to pairing!

##### Evaluation Comments

- Good error messaging.
- Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
- Following conventions for commiting but would like to see more than 3 branches for features.
- Good spacing/indentation in HTML. Small areas to push forward with ARIA - lang, alt attributes. Don't need to wrap labels around inputs if you are linking with for/id. Run through Chromevox or other screen reader next time.
- Good organization of CSS file!
- Nice work - no anonymous functions. You both have a clear understanding of event delegation. Both knew what code (including Regex) is doing.
- Longer functions in JS could be refactored.
- Remove all of your console logs for production ready code - JS line 15.

##### Feedback to Me
You were an excellent introduction to pairing! Our personalities, though different, worked well together. I really appreciated your dedication to making sure the CSS stayed true to the mock-up and dedication to pushing yourself to learn JS. A suggestion for future endeavors would be to stick to your guns on the path you want to take for the project, not letting someone with a strong personality (like myself) take over. There were times (particularly on Friday morning before the project was due) that you had begun to steer down your own, equally valid, path. Because the project was due so soon,  I pushed hard to revert back to our last functional state rather than allowing you the freedom to pursue your own styling because of the pressure from the deadline. Had you taken the time to reason through your changes with me, I believe there would have been middle ground for both our renditions to have a voice.  Additionally, your git workflow could be improved by ensuring to regularly commit and work outside of master branch (Which is something we BOTH really need to improve on... per feedback from Pam). All and all, I couldn't have asked for a better first pairing and look forward to seeing your continued growth in the program.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was very similar to Linked List but with the added challenge of utilizing localStorage. Localstorage was really tough for me to wrap my head around, but I enjoyed struggling through this with Nora. I think we both did a really great job problem solving this one!

##### Evaluation Comments

- Love that y'all hosted the project on github and that you have a readme(add the link to the hosted project on the readme!)
- The intermediate breakpoints had some weird behavior where it would get smaller and then bigger again
- Think of sad cases ie. user tries to submit an idea without a title and/or body.
###### HTML
- Generally really good HTML style in terms of indentations, but avoid inline styles!
###### CSS
- Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
- Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces
###### JS
- Work on passing objects instead of object properties
- Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card
- Work on being consistent with spacing and tabbing with conditional blocks and functions
- Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
- Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

##### Evaluation Scores

###### Functional Expectations
- Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
###### HTML
###### Accessibility
- Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
###### Style
- Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
###### CSS
###### Structure of Code
- Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
- Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
###### Implementation
- Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
- Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
###### JAVASCRIPT
###### Data Types
- Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
###### Conditional Logic
- Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
###### Functions & Scope
- Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
- Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
###### Arrays
- Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
- Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
###### Objects & Prototypes
- Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
- Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
###### DOM Manipulation
- Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling. Style
###### Style
- Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
###### GIT & GITHUB
###### Git
- Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
- Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
###### Github
- Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
###### DESIGN
###### Comp Recreation
- Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
###### PAIRING
###### Collaboration
- Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

##### Feedback to Me
Having Michelle as my partner was a great experience. Michelle was positive, encouraging, responsive and has a great work ethic. She is very organized and really kept me on track in terms of features to add and what to do in what order. I appreciated that she made the time for us to work together and was open to pairing with Mod 2 students who would ask us tougher questions. I also liked that her priority was on learning even if we didn't complete the assignment. Our pace may have been slower than that of other students, but I think we learned a lot by talking together and really pushed each other every step of the way. I was grateful that Michelle knows how to celebrate the small stuff — we did a lot of high-fives and celebrating while pairing — because that helped when things got tough. Our code eval felt like it went great, not only because we completed the assignment, but because we accomplished it together and knew how far we had come. I think our code looked great by the end, and our git workflow was also amazing. We set a goal of 60 commits and I was thrilled that we got 70 by the time we were done. I was very happy that Michelle was committed to figuring it out together because it was something we both wanted to work on. As for things to improve, I think both Michelle and I were a little stubborn about asking for help at first, especially from our own classmates. But in the future, maybe Michelle could ask for help sooner when she gets stuck. I think it would help to get the ball rolling again and help break through the roadblocks. This is something I am trying to get better at myself. Overall working with Michelle was awesome and I definitely learned a ton during this project!

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/soytjan/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

I really enjoyed this project! It was awesome to work in someone else's code base and focus more on refatoring than total functionality. There was a little functionality to implement, but I tried to focus most on understanding code that I didn't write and figuring out how to refactor something a little more complicated. 

##### Evaluation Comments

- Comp is pretty spot on and stays true to original design. Comp is fully responsive. Minor details to be adjusted - mainly shrinking size of Completed button on mobile view. Opportunities for UX while hovering over buttons. It is not clear that filter buttons are buttons with current design choices.
- Good naming on commits/branches.
- YAY for using DTR! Glad to hear that there was good communication happening during project.
- Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good spacing/indentation.
- Be sure to use semantic elements/ARIA for HTML rendered in JS file as well. Next time, use a screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader. The contrast on the text of your filter buttons is not sufficient, per accessibility testing.
- CSS could use clean up. Was able to remove almost 30 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading stylesheets and inheritance. Be sure to not assign values of display or inline on elements that are that by default. Outline-style is none by default.
- Overall, JS file looks pretty good. It's pretty readable and easy to follow your logic. Naming is good and most functions are single responsibility. Nice use of array prototypes! Areas for refactoring below:
- Unnecessary variable assigned on line 59. Just pass in Date.now() in line 60.
- Unnecessary variables assigned on lines 82-83... though it can be argued that it improves readability VERY slightly. Could just pull values directly in condition in line 84.
- prevCarriageReturnTitle & Body can be refactored into single function.
- updateBody & updateTitle can be refactored into single function.
- upvoteQuality & downvoteQuality can be refactored into single function.

##### Feedback to Me
Michelle, I feel like this was a very successful pairing. I'm glad that we did an extensive DTR before we started the project and talked about what each of our expectations were. I think that it helped establish the norms for how we were going to approach the project and allowed for us both to be flexible over the course of the week. I am thankful that we both have different working styles, because as we know, my mind runs at 600mph and I found it helpful for you to help keep me on track. I am trying to improve that part of my work style, so I really appreciated your feedback. I also appreciated your great work ethic. It was obvious the work and thought you put into every part of our project and I appreciated how much you wanted to make sure that you understood every part of the project. I know you kept saying that sometimes you're just "slow" and it takes you longer to understand concepts. I can't say I completely agree, because I watched you have some great "lightbulb" moments. You've got this! Keep pushing and working at it because you know a lot already! I was really happy with what we ended up turning in and I'm glad we both worked on all sections of the project.


## D: Professional Skills
These gear up sessions were great! I like that Turing focuses on preparing us for the professional evironment, not only with technical skills but also soft skills.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I think this was a good introductory session. This was a good reminder of how we, as students, need to approach such an intense program. This is a concept that I try to remember in other aspects of life, as well, because having a growth mindset for all of my activities will help me advance more quickly and keep a positiive attitude. 

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

In this session, we learned a little bit about how managing conginitive resources helps sustain the level of quality work that we can contribute to a project. Since this session, I have been wanting to manage this better so that I can sustain the amount of work that we are doing in the program without wasting time writing low quality code and struggling on certain tasks. 

#### Working Style: Intro Extro Ambivert

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I think this was a great session because it helped me learn what extroverts need in a pairing scenario. I had always thought that introverts needed more, but this opened my eyes to see that all types of working styles have things they need when working in a team. I had never thought about it before and I think this will be really helpful in future projects. 

#### Personal Stories and Communication

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I liked doing the life map because it helped me remember things that may have helped me get to where I am today. I would say that maybe certain parts of my story would not be relevant to share with an interviewer, but I understand that this will help me answer the question "Tell me about yourself" and set myself apart from other candidates in the job search. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I really enjoyed this film! Amanda and I were still pretty worked up about this session afterwards so we had a really great chat about our experiences in day to day life and how we can help solve this problem. I never knew that this was SO prevalent in the tech community and I am glad people are talking about it. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended a majority of the speaker events, paired with Mod 2 students for projects and tried to attend a good amount of group activities that my classmates organized. I'm also glad that Turing focuses so much on community because this is a very intense program and it's nice to have so much support from the community during this time. It also opens up a professional network for us while we are still in school.
