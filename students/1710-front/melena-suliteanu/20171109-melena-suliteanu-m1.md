# Melena Suliteanu - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to build the base of knowledge I would need to continue through the program: I was especially excited about learning to use javascript to make things interactive. With soft skills I wanted to learn how to pair effectively.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects
I did four solo projects this module. One JavaScript project (number guesser) and three static composition challenges. I enjoyed working by myself to improve on my CSS because it really gave me the space to struggle with details on my own.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was my first: the goal was to make a number guessing game where the user could submit guesses to match a randomly generated number. On win the range is updated to be 10 larger in either direction and the user can also set a preferred range. It is written in JavaScript.
Looking back I would change:
  how clean the javascript is
  it would have been fun to add more functionality
  I think the UI is a little confusing when you win and the range changes instantly without any kind of warning or explanation 

##### Evaluation comments:
  Work on syntax and spacing consistency
  Liked the fun picture injection
  Maybe add comments to CSS for better organization
  Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

##### Evaluation Scores: 
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
    Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

 #### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/oneStaticComp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project is the first static composition challenge for Module 1 at Turing. The goal of the project is to recreate the provided layout with the option to change copy, colors, and images; additionally, the site is required to be responsive and all layouts for different screen sizes were designed by me. I made my site a retirement community for milk cows with soft colors and rounded fonts and icons.

##### Fedback
  use hover states judiciously
  think about where you can reuse styling

 #### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/ms-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This is the second Static Composition challenge in Module 1 for Turing School of Software and Design. The goal is to match the layout of the original comp while creating a site with new copy, fonts, colors, and theme that is still cohesive and appealing. I chose to make my site a spell sharing site for witches. I chose witches because their connectedness to nature and owning of their womanhood really appeals to me. The site is fully responsive. Cards are laid out using CSS Grid.

##### Feedback
  softer drop shadow behind cards
  have spellBindr jump up quicker, it gets too close to nav
  consistant spacing on header
  have icons change on hover not just text
  nice colors, images

 #### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/ms-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This project is the final static composition challenge for Module 1 at Turing. The goal of the project is to recreate the provided layout with the option to change copy, colors, and images; additionally, the site is required to be responsive and all layouts for different screen sizes were designed by me. I chose to do my site on the Carpathian Mountain range in Romania. I'm trying to learn Romanian right now so I challenged myself to do the comp in Romanian (it is far from perfect but it was a fun experiment)! There are hover states on every button, all items in the navigation bar on the right, and the page tabs in the header. The site is responsive from very large desktop screens to mobile devices.

##### Feedback
  watch having _exact_ lineup of elements
  work on styling tables:
    spacing is a little weird and lines were unsuccessful
  cool that it's in Romanian
  like the background image but watch that it always covers the whole space
  

## C: Group Work & Projects

There were three group projects this module. I enjoyed the pair projects as a way to learn how to code collaboratively with another person. This is an important skill to have as a programmer and having that practice helped me learn a lot. I also enjoyed the opportunity to learn from and teach my peers.

### Projects

To further build on coding skills while also practicing pairing we had a number of paired projects.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/valentinovtino/mod1-linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project is a bookmarking application for websites. Users can create bookmarks with a title and a link, and delete them. They are not stored. This was a paired project with Valentino Valentin where we both contributed to every part of the project. The project is written with jQuery.

##### Evaluation Comments:
  Confusing for user that Enter button is red when disabled - try graying it out instead. Not clear that Delete Read button is      actually a button due to design.
  Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
  Nice use of branches and commit messages on GitHub!
  Be sure indents are the same throughout in HTML file and that things are not double-indented Lines 13-17.
  YAY ARIA - alt, lables/inputs, semantic tags.
  Stick with one unit of measurement in CSS for consistency (em vs px) - stysheet has a mixture of both.
  Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
  JS file is easy to read and functions are single responsibility. No anonymous functions and good naming conventions. Both       could speak to code.

##### Evaluation Scores:
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
    Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lexbonder/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project is a site where you can enter an idea title and body and save it. The ideas are persisted in local storage using JSON. Once ideas are created they can be assigned a quality, edited, searched by content, and deleted. It was a paired project with Alex Bonder and we both had a part in every aspect of the project. 

##### Evaluation Comments:
  Work on passing objects instead of object properties
  Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card
  Work on spacing in parameters/arguments
  Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
  Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

##### Evaluation Scores
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach       was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
    
###### HTML

  ###### Accessibility

    Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made       in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
    Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen             readers, etc.
   ###### Style

    Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid         formatting that follows industry best practices.

###### CSS

   ###### Structure of Code

    Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout,        components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within       rules alphabetically.
    Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to         reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles         of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

   ###### Implementation

     Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in                implementation approach for layout.

###### JAVASCRIPT

   ###### Data Types

     Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on          each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

  ###### Conditional Logic

     Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements       that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where                 applicable.

  ###### Functions & Scope

    Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it             contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring       any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

  ###### Arrays

     Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift.          Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
     Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate          arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is                          comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods        they have not worked with before.

  ###### Objects & Prototypes

      Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on               different object instances.
      Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use         cases for prototypes.

  ###### DOM Manipulation

      Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of               whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
  ###### Style

      Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable           and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal           duplication.

###### GIT & GITHUB

  ###### Git

      Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while          infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
      Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of          incomplete features or bugs.

  ###### Github

      Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates.            Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

   ###### DESIGN

  ###### Comp Recreation

      Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at         least 1 breakpoint.
      Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a             pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful             effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well               executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or         may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

 ##### PAIRING

   ###### Collaboration

     Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback          and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively              implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal                learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
     Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced,         and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused            demeanor.


#### 2Do Box

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/2do-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project was a paired project where we inherited another team's Idea Box and refactored/pivoted to a 2Do Box application. I worked with Sabrina Kennedy. We refactored the code so that functions were all single responsiblity and there was less duplication of code. We also structured the passing of arguments so that functions are mostly passing objects instead of a list of object properties.

##### Evaluation Comments 
  Stays true to the spirit of the comp. Good color palette!! Fully responsive.

  Add indication on hover that buttons are clickable. Filter buttons could be a little bigger. Move 'show more' button down to      bottom or make it obvious to the user that more cards have been added off-screen.

  Good naming on commits/branches.

  Great job using a DTR. Sounds like things went well and that you both enjoyed doing all parts of the project together.

  Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good indentation. Remove unnecessary spacing between lines.

  Add lang attribute to HTML. Add label to search input. Be sure to use ARIA on HTML you render in your JS file. Use a              screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader.

  CSS could use clean up. Was able to remove over 30 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading           stylesheets and inheritance. Be sure to not assign values of display or inline on elements that are that by default.           Outline-style is none by default.

  JS file good overall. Most functions are single responsibility. Hooray for dynamic functions for edit title/task and             changing importance! Areas for refactoring below:

  Group event listeners that are a single line together - for improved readability.

  Avoid names like instantiateNewObject for your functions. Confusing. Gives no clue as to what this object does.

  textValidation function isn't fully functional. Allows user to append empty cards with no title AND no input to DOM/save in     storage. Still saves cards/appends even when one field is missing.

  Search funtionality broken.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

I got a lot out of this gear up. Having a growth mindset is not something I was introduced to until college. It's been something I struggle with since most of my education felt like it was valuing inherent talents. I really appreciated the reminder that skills are learned and grown with effort and an imperfect first attempt doesn't mean I will never learn it. I remind myself of this frequently, and I also enjoy the culture that this mindset creates.

#### Dealing with Difference

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

My introversion is something I've been aware of and comfortable with for a long time. It was good to be reminded that I also have some extroverted tendencies that have only been growing as I get older. This exercise was an interesting examination of how much I've shifted towards being an ambivert. I also always enjoy hearing about how true extroverts experience the world because it is quite different from my experience.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This gear up was really helpful in being aware of cognitive load and how to minimize it. Getting things to muscle memory is a really effective method for reducing the effort that more difficult things require. When you've got to focus on every component of a project really hard the project is much harder than if pieces were automatic. This is an extremely helpful tip to have for programming since there are so many base things to know that could make bigger projects easier.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I don't have favorites but if I did this would be my favorite gear up. It was really wonderful to know that everyone was getting on the same page about the realities of these issues in the tech world. At the same time it was sobering to see what I'll be coming up against. As a dedicated feminist I realized that it will be hard for me to just accept these things, and also it can be damaging to stand up. I came away glad that we are attempting to put out a group of developers that is aware of the problem and willing to confront it.

#### Code: Case Study with Mod 4: Social Movements in Tech

In this group we talked about how to make a difference in social movements using tech. I enjoyed hearing all of the Mod 4 people share the ideas they had for the topics they were interested in. I spent my research time looking into how tech can positively impact the sustainibility of agriculture. I think there is a lot of space for improvement in this area but it is one of the reasons I wanted to get into coding so it was nice to continue thinking about it now that I have actually developed some skills.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My class: I think I know most of the people in my cohort pretty well, and I've developed some wonderful friendships. I asked for help and tried to step up helping other people when they needed it as well.

Posse: I went to my posse every week and got to know some people in other mods/cohorts. I really enjoyed that time and I look forward to continuing to show up and meet new people. We also had some cross-posse discussions which was great to meet even more new people.

I also went to every talk on Friday mornings and spoke with other students and speakers.
