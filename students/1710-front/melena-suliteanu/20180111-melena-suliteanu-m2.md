## A: End of Module Assessment

It went smoothly. I felt confident about the material.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod I worked on two individual projects: Sorting-suite and Complete-me.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project I wrote bubble, insertion, merge, and quick sort algorithms. They have a comprehensive test suite that test functionality and the limit to what they can each consistantly sort in less than 2 seconds. The evaluation was a livecode of either merge or quick sort and an explanation of how the not coded algorithm works using cards.

#### Evaluator: Leta


## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project I wrote a series of methods that implemented a prefix trie. The trie is able to insert words into its structure, search words, and suggest words based on a prefix. It can also select words and offer words in order of preference and delete words from suggestions. The evaluation was live coding either the insert or suggest function and explaining on a whiteboard how the insertion works node by node.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In mod 2 the group projects were GameTime and Weathrly.

## GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For this project I worked with Casey Dallavalle. We made a version of [Winterbells](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm) that we called SpaceHopper because it was set in space. We used the HTML5 canvas element to render a game written in javascript. This project used a lot of object oriented programming and rendering approximations of physics. 

### Evaluator: Leta

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly is the first project that utilises React and data from an API (weatherunderground api). The application has components for the current weather, 7 hour, ten day, and current moon phase as well as a search, weather card, and suggestion component. A user is able to type in a city/state location that provides clickable suggestions or a zip code. There is a start page and a main page and when user puts in location they see the weather for that place which persists on refresh. There is a back to home button that will take user back to start page and clear local storage so they stay there on refresh. An error message displays if a location is not found in the database.

### Evaluator: Leta and Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### User Interface

* would be nice to be able to type in lowercase city names 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### HTML Style 

* don't like the br 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/SASS Style

* Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach to design and component architecture.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

## Ethics of Open Source

This session discussed something different from what I was expecting and I really enjoyed it. We talked about open source licensing and the ethics around different license options. I found myself having much more conflicted feelings than I thought I would. We looked at the rights of developers, companies, and larger communities through different philisophical lenses.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

This session was about how technology plays into the attention economy. I was especially struck by how predatory some products can be, explicitly preying on tendencies of the human brain so that people will keep using a product, even past the point where they feel good about their use. I wish we would have talked more about our responsibility as developer to recognize the impact we can have, but I still thought it was a good session.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This session let each of us examine the ways we do and don't have privilege. I had already spent a lot of time examining the ways in which I do and don't experience privilege so I didn't learn a ton about myself from the questionnaire. I did learn a lot about my classmates and how they see themselves and I think it led to some productive and occasionally difficult conversations.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I paired a lot with Mod 2 and helped lead a mythical creatures session. I am a member of Joan Clarke. I go to every optional class that is available on Friday mornings. I usually attend Iron FE twice a week on the mornings I don't have Joan Clarke. This mod I also found a mentor that is a Turing graduate.
