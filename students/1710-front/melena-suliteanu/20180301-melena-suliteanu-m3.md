"Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude." -Michelle Obama

#### Lego Swapi Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

The goals of this project were to practice React, Router, asynchronous JS, and testing. The landing page has a movie scroll from a random Star Wars movie and buttons for the people, planets, and vehicles of Star Wars and user favorites. Each button leads to a different page via router which displays cards of trivia for that topic. Cards can be favorited and are added to a user's favorites. 
I made this project Lego themed and the whole page can be translated to Shyriiwook (the language of the wookies) for a little extra joy.

#### Puzzle Swap: Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/puzzle-swap)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal of this project was to make something I'm excited about that pulls together everything I've learned in Mod 3. 
I chose to make an application for people who love jigsaw puzzles and don't have anything to do with ones they've completed. Someone who is not logged in is able to view all puzzles. A user can sign up or log in to claim or post a puzzle. The post puzzle form takes a title, an image (that can be cropped to a specific aspect ratio), number of pieces, and number of pieces missing. A user can unlist their own puzzles from the main page. To claim a puzzle, user clicks claim on the puzzle itself which starts a message with the owner. They can then message back and forth to come to an agreement about handoff.

This project uses React, Redux, Router, and react-image-crop on the frontend with Firebase realtime database, authentication, and cloud storage for data storage.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

"We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect." - Michelle Obama

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

I paired with [Matt Renn](https://github.com/rennmatthewp) on this project. It was a React/Router project to display kindergarten attendence data for the state of Colorado. Our goal was to practice React and testing.

Feedback for me: nice job making a mock helper class for tests!

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

I paired with [Jeff Bender](https://github.com/j25bender) and [Spencer Herms](https://github.com/PreciseSlice) on this project. We were provided a backend for storing user login information and favorites. A user can sign up or log in and view some popular and recent movies displayed as movie posters that flip over for more information on hover. A logged in user can click a heart below each movie poster to favorite it, and go to a favorites page to view all of their favorites.
The project uses React, Redux, and Router.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

“We have this window of opportunity; we have a chance to make something real happen. Something possible happen, to live beyond our fear — think about that, and help us. Help lift us up, help us fight this fight to change — transform — this country in a fundamental way…. This chance won’t come around again.” -Michelle Obama

#### Microaggressions

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This gear up gave me the opportunity to reflect on how I've grown at interacting with people that are different from me in some way. It's something I've been actively working on for as long as I can remember and I value the time we were given to think about what we've learned and times we haven't done it right.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I'm obsessed with the article we read for this gear up. I think it was an extremely powerful visualization tool because it was based on math. Although I already believed the premise of the article I think it has the potential to be very persuasive. I had a great conversation with my group about the importance of intentionally cultivating diversity.

#### Avoiding Burnout (Mod4 led)

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_2.md)

This session helped me frame my feelings around burnout. Although I don't think I've reached full burnout at Turing I've gotten pretty exhausted a few times and I think the lessons carry. We talked about introversion and that is something that definitely contributes to my tiredness on group projects, because I work really hard to be a good partner/team member and while that makes for a very positive project experience it also leaves me more tired after. We talked about self care and preventing burnout by taking care of yourself consistantly and that was a good reminder.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

“You see, our glorious diversity – our diversity of faiths, and colors and creeds―that is not a threat to who we are, it makes us who we are.” - Michelle Obama

I am one of my class' student advisory board representatives, I attend Joan Clarke Society's meetings every week, and I'm an active member of the Pahlka civic tech group.
