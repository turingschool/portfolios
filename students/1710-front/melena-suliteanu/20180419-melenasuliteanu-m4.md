# Melena Suliteanu Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest achievement

I am very proud of my time management this module. I was able to get all of my assignments done well and on time while balancing a lot of extracurricular engagements. I made a lot of connections with developers in Denver and applied to jobs. I also participated actively in Joan Clarke, Student Advisory Board, and Pahlka. I competed in GoCode Colorado and contributed to mythical creatures to add to the diversity of Turing's introduction to TDD for students. I'm very proud of the quality and quantity of things I got done because it took very intentional time management.

## Struggle and lessons

This module I have struggled with feelings of imposter syndrome as I get closer to having a job. There is always more to know in development and as someone who is untested in an actual work environment I find the skepticism of others rubs off on me. This was somewhat exacerbated by the fact that a lot of our lessons this module were very topical - I learned a lot from them and I value that they were more of a survey than a deep dive, but it also made me feel like I didn't know what was going on. I know that I have the skills to be a developer because I encounter problems in my work and I have the ability to seek out the answers on my own. Reminding myself of this was a theme of the module and one I expect to continue.

## Backend Experience

I loved getting exposure to backend development. It is deeply gratifying to understand more deeply how servers and databases are set up and I feel that I have a good foundation for learning more. It also confirmed for me that I really love frontend development. On BYOB, as cool as the project was, I missed having a frontend. After this module I feel that my ideal job would have a balance of front and backend work.

## Biggest lesson

Growth mindset. Of all the things I picked up at Turing, the intentional cultivation of growth mindset is the most important for me. I know that I am naturally a very results driven person and it has been very empowering and eye opening for me to put the emphasis on what I can learn rather than what I already know. It has given me the ability to learn big new concepts without fear.
