## Areas of Emphasis

My primary focus this Module was to become familar with array prototypes and to become more confident in expressing my ideas while working in group projects.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were Sorting-Suite and Complete-Me. These projects introduced us to data strucures we may need to know for future interviews.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting-Suite introduced us in to sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. We were required to implement these algorithms and test them.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/Complete-Me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete Me introduced us to Linked Lists and Binary Tries. This project required us to create a low level version of an auto complete system in javascript. The trie was required to be able to take in new words, sugguest words, and delete suggestions a user doesn't want to see. We were also required to develop tests for our trie.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were GameTime and Weathrly. These projects gave the opportunity to continure to learn how to efficiently code with other people. Git/Github and good communication were essential to a successful pair collaboration. During these group projects, we practiced giving verbal constructive feedback in an effective way.



## GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For this project, we were required to recreate a game of breakout. This project helped us learn how to implement object oriented programming. 

### Evaluator: Leta

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.



## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project introduced us to ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application. We used these tools to create a weather app that pulls in data from an API.

### Evaluator: Nathaniel

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations 

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints



#### Community Gearup 

I attended the Gearup session about net neutrality. With the recent vote to repeal net neutrality, this class was beneficial because it educated me on what net neutality is and the importance of it. They also gave us insite on things we can do to get net neutrality back.

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

During this gearup, we explored how the attention economy affects us as both users and future developers. We identified the tools used by companies and technologies to capture user attention and how that generates revenue. We also discussed how as a developer, we need to understand our role in developing technologies that contribute to, or take away from, creating tools that pull in users.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gearup had us reflect on how our unique experiences of privilege and marginalization have affected your sense of connection to those around you. This session showed that everyone has gone through something tough in their life and because of that we should show empathy for those around us because we don't know what they have gone through.



## E: Community Participation

This mod I was able to participate in the community more. I did a couple pairing sessions with mod1 and was able to help them with problems they had in their code. I also got to know my cohort mates more and offered help to them when they needed it.
