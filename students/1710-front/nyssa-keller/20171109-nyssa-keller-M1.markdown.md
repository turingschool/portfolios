## A: End of Module Assessment



## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects for Mod 1 were Number Guesser and three static compositions.
These projects gave me the opportunity to practice skills I have already developed and to expand on those skills.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser introduced us to using javascript for DOM manipulation. The project was a game that generates a random number and the user's goal is to guess the random number. The user guess would be compared to the random generator developed by the application.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/NK_Static-Comp1)
* [GitHub Pages](https://nyssakeller.github.io/NK_Static-Comp1/.)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Description:

   For static comp one, we were required to recreate a comp in order to practice our newly developed CSS skills. The composition was a profile made up of eight squares and a large photo to the right. For me, this served as an introduction to using flex.

Evaluation Comments:
    
   Work on responsiveness
   Include viewport meta tag


#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/NK-Static-Comp2)
* [GitHub Pages](https://nyssakeller.github.io/NK-Static-Comp2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Description:

   The goal for static comp 2 was to build a website with a simple header with a series of eight cards below with different information inside each card.

Evaluation comments: 
    
   Test comp on bigger screens
   Be mindful of margins



#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/nk-static-comp3)
* [GitHub Pages] (https://nyssakeller.github.io/nk-static-comp3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Description:
    
   Static comp three required us to build out a complicated website with a navigation bar to the left, a searchbar, in the header, and several different areas of content in the main section. This composition was much more challenging than the other static comps. It was difficult to  display and position all of elements while making all of those things adjust appropriately on different screen widths.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects in Mod 1 gave the opportunity learn how to efficiently code with other people. Git/Github and good communication was an essential to a successful pair collaboration.


#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description:
    
   Linked list was the first pair project of the mod. This project required us to build a website which allowed users to create a list of bookmarks which they could then mark as read or delete. 


Evaluation Comments:

   html:
        Indentation in html is almost there but could use another combthrough
        Comments in html seem redundant for production code
        Would recommend using a minified version of jquery in future projects for faster load times
    css:
        No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only
        Try to avoid using negative values in css
    js:
        Cool to see that you used both function expressions and declarations, but pick one or the other in the future
        Would like to see more consistency and diligence with spacing, indentation, and semicolons
        lines 34 and 35 should be moved toward top as they are currently floating in no mans land
        Would like to see more verbose names of vars and functions and more verb like function names
    git/github:
        Would like to see more verbose commit messages and have those commits tell more of a story

Feedback from my Partner:

   Nyssa was amazing! We helped each other through some tough git hub issues and still presented a great linked list project. She was a very good communicator we used slack and sat next to each other in class. Nyssa kept all her commitments like getting the JavaScript she was responsible for working. If there was any coaching I could offer it would be to not hesitate to offer suggestions.



#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nyssakeller/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description: 
    
   Ideabox took a lot of concepts from Linked List and built off of them. While having all of the same concepts as Linked List, it added concepts such as local storage, filtering through cards with a search bar, and letting the user be able to edit text once they click on it.

Evaluation Comments:

   LOVE that you still pushed forward on specs even after the cutoff time for the project.
   Comp stays true to spirit of the comp - mobile needs to be tweaked.
   Good use of naming in branches and commits!
   Remove unnecessary spacing in HTML file. Good naming for classes. Incorporate more ARIA (lang, labels).
   Run through CSS selectors w/dev tools to be sure that every line is doing something - 10 declarations that aren't doing      anything for the layout (mostly flexbox related)
   Good use of a counter to keep track of IDs on cards! Hooray for using $.each in line 27
   Opportunities for refactoring: Event listener from lines 50-95 should be refactored into single responsibility functions - too many things are happening here. Make title, body, and quality local variables. Should only need to pull value from input field (for creating object) one time. Once object is created, should only need to pass object as an argument instead of each individual property.

Feedback from my Partner:
    
   I loved working with you! I really appreciated your workflow, dedication to the project, and willingness to combine the best parts of our codes. I think we both came up with good solutions, and being flexible in implementing the best parts of both created a really great project! My only advice would be to continue believing in yourself and trusting your abilities. You're already a great programmer.


#### 2doBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/todo-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Description:

   2doBox was the first project we had that involved refactoring someone else's code. We took their code from IdeaBox and refactored their code while adding new functionalities to the project as well.

Evaluation Comments:
    
   good use of Github
   worked well together! Clearly both own the codebase and can speak to it.
   CSS has opportunities for further refactoring, especially with media queries
   loved that they had a "most proud of" refactored function to talk about
   Solid choices and clear strategy for approaching the refactor.
   Good work! Nicely done.

Feedback from my Partner:

   Having Nyssa as my partner was a great experience. Nyssa is fun, responsible, and a hard worker. I am super impressed by how mature and driven she is for her age. I had fun getting to know her and was glad she agreed to hang out, like when we went to the Pacific Market to get candy. Nyssa is also very organized and would remind me to do a commit to git when I wasn't even thinking about it. In addition, she's a good communicator and was always available on Slack if I had a question. I especially liked that Nyssa insisted on being present for every step of the project and figuring it out together. Our pace may have been slower than that of other students, but I think we made good progress together. There were only a few times where we really felt stuck, but we were able to get through them by asking for help from peers or waiting to ask Mod 2 in our pair sessions (which we strategically signed up for way in advance!). As for things to improve, I think Nyssa could make sure to keep her future partners up to date if her plans change, and to holler when she needs help. For example, I thought both of us were going to meet with Thomas on Tuesday, but since our Static Comp was due that afternoon, Nyssa used the pairing session to work on her own project. I was a little confused at first, but it didn't affect our project, since we were in a good place. Still I hope that she knows that she can always ask me (or anyone in our class) for help if she needs it! I could also sense that Nyssa got a little panicked when things were weird with our git branches and conflicts - and I think getting better at git (to the point of trusting it and using it on solo projects) would really help. This is something that I am also working on too, so I should take my own advice! Overall working with Nyssa was a lot of fun and I look forward to working with her again in the future!




## D: Professional Skills

While Turing teaches us how to become successful developers, Turing also makes it a main focus that our time at Turing also teaches us professional skills that are a neccessity in the workplace.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

 Growth Mindset provides a sense of comfort when learning new and difficult concepts on a daily basis at Turing. It is derived from the concept of keeping an open mind during times of struggle. Growth mindset is an important concept which I constantly kept in mind when I was struggling. It gave me the perseverance to work through my struggles so I can get past them.


#### Personal Stories and Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This gear up session made me understand how powerful telling your story can be if you do it efficently. I learned that it is something you have to practice and that it should be told the same everytime. Telling your story is the most efficent way you can give someone a good impression of you. This will be a very valuable skill to have when interviewing for jobs.


#### Gear Up with Mod4: Social Movements in Tech

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1710-inning/group_four.md)

This gear up was very eye-opening. I always knew that I wanted to help people, but I wasn't really sure how I could do that in tech. During this gear up, the mod4 students shared specific socail movements they are passionate about and how technology can help these movement. Their passions included helping refugees from North Korea, saving the environment, helping the homeless, and politics. It was cool to see the ways they want to help these movements by using their skills as developers.


#### Working Styles: Introverts vs Extroverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This gear up made me conscious of how my introvert tendencies can be percieved from someone with extrovert tendencies. It made me aware that eventhough it may make me uncomfortable, I need to be more open to sharing my ideas. During this session many extroverts said that they found it difficult to work with someone that is not sharing their ideas with them because it makes them feel the need to take complete charge of the situation. After hearing this, I know I have to change the way I collaborate with people so that way my teams and I can be successful.



#### Debuggin the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

Debugging the Gender Gap gave me a better understanding of the struggles some women have had working as a developer. Before watching this video, I had no idea that these type of struggles still exist. It also made me realize how lucky I am that I have not had an experience where I felt like I was being treated unfairly for being a girl. I found it inspiring that more and more women are working as developers.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I didn't get to play a part of the Turing Community as much as I would have liked to. I was mainly focused on all of the new skills I was learning and trying to get a routine down for my time at Turing. I enjoyed time I got to spend with my posse and cohort. However, next mod, I plan to play a bigger part in the Turing community.
