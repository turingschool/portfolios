This project uses React in order to display upcoming concerts near the user. The user can search for different locations and can also search for their favorite artists and see if they have a concert coming up near the user. The project is pulling in data from the Ticket Master API and the Bands in Town API.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

During this gear-up we looked at a set of scenarios that are considered microaggressions. We discovered that all of us commit microaggressions. During this session, we were taught the skills of how to discuss or interrupt them.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up showed us how fragile the balance of diverity. It shows that if even one person is not okay with working with people that are different than them, the balance will be thrown off. The gear up made us be aware of the importance of diversity in the work place.

#### YOUR SPECIFIC MOD 4-LED GEAR UP (Burn Out)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_2.md)

During this gear up, they went into depth on what exactly burn out is. It made me realize that the last two weeks I was burnt out. They also gave us tools and tips on how we can prevent burn out and what we can do when we begin to feel burnt out. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod was personally taxing on me so I did not play much of a part in the community. However, at the beginning of the mod when I had more energy, I led two iron FE sessions. I enjoyed helping mod2 strengthen their skills. It also helped me realize how much I know about  array prototypes.
