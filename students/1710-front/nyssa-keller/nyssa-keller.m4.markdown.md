When I started Turing I was a current child. I just turned twenty the month prior to mod 1. Almost everyone just made a major career change, while this was the first career I’ve chosen to pursue. Before Turing I took college classes while working retail. Because of my difference in background, I jokingly gave myself the title “child”.

I though mod4 was going to be the worst because I was sure I was going to hate learning backend and that I wasn't going to be good at it. It was not as bad as I thought and I actually ended up enojoying it. It was cool to see frontends come to life because of the backend. Knowing how to do some backend made me feel more like a developer because I can now make complete projects. However I was not completely wrong in dreading mod4. It was difficult to find balance between job search and completing projects plus the added pressure of finding a job was not helpful. It has taught me how to manage my time better when there is so much to be done and how to deal with a lot of stress.

Throughout my time at Turing, I became a developer all while growing as a person. At Turing I accomplished gaining confidence in myself and mastering the art of using gifs in presentations. While I have more confidence now then I did before, obtaining that confidence as a developer and as a person was my biggest struggle. After working with Melissa, I was more confidence. I don’t know how she did it but she helped me realize that I shouldn’t be so unsure of myself. Getting to work with her was a blessing. I know this presentation is supposed to be about me, but she has helped me so much throughout my time at Turing, it didn’t feel right to not give her a shout out.

Leaving Turing I have strong technical skills and I have knowledge that will help me while I’m on the job search and once I get a job as well. I entered Turing as a current child, but I leave Turing as a former child.
