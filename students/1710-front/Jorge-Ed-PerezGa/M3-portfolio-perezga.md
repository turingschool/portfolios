M3 PORTFOLIO

## Jorge Ed PerezGa - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really enjoy my time at Turing School. I believe Turing is one of the happiest and most rewarding experiences I have ever been part of. The school is a place of high demands and day to day projects and activities that are extremely overwhelming. But the school is far more than that; Turing is a welcoming community for anyone and all who have ever felt outcasted before, it is a place where very different people come together, learn together and teach one another. At Turing you cannot take more than you give, this is reason why I set out to be a positive part of the community, helping my classmates every chance possible and presenting highly functional and visually appealing projects throughout the module.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### HeadCount 2.0

### Students: Jorge Ed PerezGa
### Evaluator: Will

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Rubric

## Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3- - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow
- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Surprise and Delight
- 4 - Unicorn

#### SWAPIbox

### Students: Jorge Ed PerezGa
### Evaluator: Will

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### Personal Project - HYPERSPACE

### Students: Jorge Ed PerezGa
### Evaluator: Christie

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/hyperspace)

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense.

There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

Death by a thousand knives refers to the big impact constant micoraggressions have on an individual. It is pivotal to be aware of our actions by not making insensitive and ignorant comments, and when one does, be open to understanding why certain things can really affect someone that does not share similar qualities.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Tragedy of commons explains the importance of diversity in a community, while having having a group of individuals that you can relate too.
