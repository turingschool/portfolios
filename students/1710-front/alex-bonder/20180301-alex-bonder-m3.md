# Alex Bonder - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main focus was to learn as much as I could in order to make a personal project I could be truly proud of. I believe I accomplished that goal with Step to the Beat.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The personal Projects from this mod were SWAPI-box, and my personal project, Step to the Beat.

#### SWAPI-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project utilized the Star Wars API to create an app that will load cards containing different characters, planets, and vehicles featured in the movie. This project was made in React and itâ€™s main focus was in handling multiple API requests.

#### Step to the Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/step-to-the-beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Step to the Beat is an app that lets a user enter their walking or running pace in Steps-per-minute, and returns them a playlist of songs with the same Beats-perminute. This project features React, React-redux, React-router, Firebase, and the SpotifyAPI.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects in Mod 3 were HeadCount2.0 and MovieTracker

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount was our first group project in Mod 3. It focused on showing an understanding of React and API calls. We were given some tests in order to guide how our functionality should develop. After those iterations We needed to make an interface that made sense and present the data in a logical manner.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/movie-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker introduced us to a lot of new things. This project featured Redux, a backend, and a 3 person group. Each of those presented new challenges to overcome in creating the movie tracking app. Ultimately the app gets data from the movie database and presents the information in interactive cards.

## D: Professional Skills

The gear up sessions this mod were all about opening our eyes and minds to things in the workplace and society that we may not have been aware of.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

Ths session was very interesting to me. I didn't realize going into this gear up how often a microaggression can occur. The main takeaway from this session was that stopping all microaggressions may be impossible because it's impossible to know everyone's life story and know immediately what will and will not upset someone. Realizing this, the best thing people can do  is to be mindful. Be aware of what upsets people and what doesnt. Keep an eye open to see when people get upset by microaggressions and stand up for people if the events occur.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up was very interesting because it showed how people with biases tend to keep groups divided where once people develop anti-biases society blends together much faster. This led to many discussions around forcing diversity in an environment. We were discussing whether or not it was even possible to do, and how it can be done in a way that seems fair and non-patronizing. Ultimately there were no solutions discovered at this gear up, but it did lead to a lot of good discussion and thinking points.

#### What is your favorite flavor of s**t sandwhich? - Mod 4 Led

* GitHub URL - N/A

This session was great for me to go to because it was about deciding what kind of company you want to work for. I still have no idea what I want to do once I'm out in the field but thanks to this gear up I know that I'm not looking for a startup in it's infancy. My goal in pursuing software development was for the stability and consistency of a regular 9-5. I learned that a brand new startup does not offer that kind of lifestyle. Start ups are always happening, so once I'm in a position where I'm financially stable enough to take that kind of risk.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My goals as a part of the community was to make myself available to anyone seeing assistance and pairing. I also always volunteer for the try turing events. I think it's a good way to show that anyone can make it at turing if they have the grit and determination. Next mod I plan on presenting my personal project at code fair and I will certainly have something for next mod's demo night.
