## Alex Bonder - M2 Portfolio
### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for mod 2 was to continue gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript and to become more involved in the Turing community. I started attending Iron FE and I've become very active in researching and attending Meetup events happening in Denver.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects
  The individual projects this mod were Sorting Suite and Complete Me. Sorting Suite taught us 4 different algorithms for sorting information. Complete Me was a project where we created a data tree which could take information and suggest completions based on the partial information it is given.

### Sorting Suite
* GitHub URL - https://github.com/lexbonder/sorting-suite
* Original Assignment - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html

### Description

Sorting Suite is a collection of algorithms that sort numbers. We built bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. This was an individual project but the class was encouraged to work together to figure out solutions and solve the problem. I ended up working in a group of about 5 people and after we figured out each algorithm it was just a matter of doing reps to memorize the logic in creating the programs.

### Evaluation score - Pass

## Complete Me
* GitHub URL - https://github.com/lexbonder/complete-me
* Original Assignment - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html

### Description

The assignment for this project was to build the code that will create a data tree. Like sorting suite, this was an individual project where we were allowed to work in groups to solve the problems. We needed to write logic that would take in a string or set of numbers and configure them into a data tree. Once that step was completed we made functions to have the tree return suggestions for completion based on a partial data entry. The tree was able to take in the dictionaries from our machines and reccoment words. Later steps in the project included selecting words and having them appear in higher priority than the rest of the words. The last phase was to get the tree to delete words from the tree without losing extra data.

### Evaluation score - Pass

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects
  There were two group projects in this Module. Game Time and Weatherly. Game time focused on our use of HTML Canvas. Weatherly was our first experience with React.

## Game Time - Frogger
* GitHub URL - https://github.com/lexbonder/game-time
* Original Assignment - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

### Description

Making frogger was an incredible experience. I love the game so I was very determined to build it in a way that it would have all of my favorite aspects. I felt very lucky to have Kailin as a partner because she is also an avid gamer. Our experience with video games meant that we knew what finer details to look for and what, as a gamer, to expect to see. Learning to use HTML Canvas was a very exciting journey as well. It was very interesting to troubleshoot when something didn't go right because of the 60fps refresh rate things on screen would come and go very quickly. This was also our first experience using multiple js files for one project.

### Evaluation comments:

- Remove DOM references from Game.js
- Understanding of how to leverage parameters is still shaky
    - example: if you only want to use the canvas width, avoid passing in the whole canvas

Evaluation scores:

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Weatherly
* GitHub URL - https://github.com/lexbonder/weatherly
* Original Assignment - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

### Description

This project was our first using React. React takes all the best parts of JavaScript and HTML and pushes them together. I found the component structure of React to make the whole project much easier to understand. Passing information around became much simpler. This project was also our first experience using an API we used the data from The Weather Underground to have live data for whichever city we looked up. We utilized the Complete-Me project to allow autocompletion of cities and zip codes. This project used all of the moving parts to create a weather app.

## D: Professional Skills
  The Gear Up sessions this module were very interesting. We took a lot of time to focus on learning about other people and ourselves. Everything we learned this mod is something very useful for becoming better developers and better workers in general.

### Gear Up

### (Session 1) - Empathy

GitHub URL - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown

  The main takeaway that I had from this gear up session is that people need to realize that they do have biases about their lives and the lives of other people. They need to be able to recognize that the biases are something we're programmed to believe, but they don't resemble the truth. It's important for everyone to recognize the biases they hold and actively fight against them. We discussed in our group that sometimes our first thought is what we're told to think, but our second thought is what we actually think. Its important to know that everyone comes from a different background and therefore we each have different stories and different perceptions of the same things that happen around us. 


### (Session - 2) Attention Economy

GitHub URL - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md

  The discussion about the attnetion economy made a lot of sense to me. As an avid social media user I experience it all the time. I've heard all of the tricks that the companies use to try and get people attached to their websites. This gear up did help me focus my attention to where my attention is going. When I did homework over the weekend I made sure to use a pom timer and only allowed my attention to be taken by social media during breaks. One intersting question we were asked is whose responsibility is it to manage our attention, ours or the business. At first I figured you can't stop a business from doing what it wasnts so the responsiblity falls on the user. A person in my group mentioned that the businesses are actively exploiting a flaw in human biology to attract our attention, which did open me to the possibility that the businesses should be responsible. But I still feel it's near impossible to stop a business from doing what it wants to do. All they care about is what brings money in. Their money comes in through our attention, so they'll do whatever it takes to get it.

### (Session - 3) Mod 4 Led - Draw the Owl

GitHub URL - (N/A)

  This gear up was about failure which is one of my favorite topics. We discussed how the key to combatting failure is having grit. Whenever someone discusses grit they use the phrase "it's a marathon, not a sprint" this phrase resonates with me very strongly because during this mod I was literally training for a half marathon. I have been living the struggles of dealing with failure when some runs went well and were easy and other runs did not. In relation to Turing, failure is something we're faced with every day. Bugs in code, error messages, typos and syntax erros. Facing these things every day can become very difficult to deal with, but the only true failure is giving up. Unless you give up the goal you're working toward you have not failed. The point of this gear up was to reframe the way people look at failure. In my case I am already living the advice this gear up had to offer.


## E: Community Participation - Playing a Part

  This mod I made an effort to pair with the mod 1 students as much as possible. I made myself available for every lunch and evening that I didn't have to go for a run. I also made an effort to go into their classroom as an unofficial and less intimidating way of showing that I was there for help with anything they needed.
  
  Aside from helping Mod 1 I also submitted my creation of frogger for the code fair. I remember in mod 1 seeing all of the creations was incredible and inspiring for me. I wanted to give back and while my frogger game isn't going to be a top seller any time soon, I was able to discuss it and bring some excitement to the project.
