## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)
  These are my projects for Mod 1. The individual projects that I did were a good experience to learn new tricks and develop good habits developing code at my own pace in order to develop my own style. I enjoyed adding some creative elements into the projects such as the jumbling numbers in the intro screen for Number Guesser, and being able to apply the Zelda and Super Smash themes into the static comps. Ultimately I focused on completing the task assigned without going too far off course for the project.

#### (Project Name) - Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(description)
  Number guesser is a game that I built where a user is instructed to either enter their own parameters or play with a basic 1-100 range. The game instructs the user if their guess is too high or too low until they find the right answer, then they can go to the next level.

  Notes/What To Work On:
    Work on that git flow, spacing, and syntax
    Good work on getting the comp right.
    Work on adding aria
    Great job only using global vars when necessary - consider passing local vars as arguments to other functions

    #### (Project Name) - Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/ab-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

(description)
  The part I'm particularly proud of is the fonts and symbols. All of the symbols in the articles are technically text, I found a website that lets you download the font style which changes letters a-s to symbols, I then manipulated them to look good! The header font is the same font used for the design of the game, and the paragraph text is the same style that's seen in the actual gameplay on NES.

  I used two different images, one for when the section was vertical and one for when it becomes horizontal. I did not change the color scheme because I think it would be too big of a change at the break point and could be disorienting. Both pictures are easily recognizable by fans of the franchise.
  

    #### (Project Name) - Staic Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/ab-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

(description)
  This was our second attempt at a static comp. This one focused on organizing cards, making sure that as the screen size gets smaller that the cards re-organized properly, When there were an odd number of cards, the remainder at the bottom was meant to shift over to the left rather than float in the middle.

  My feedback for this one included avoiding the glow behind the numbers in the bottom corner of the cards. I could have just used the darker version of the color as seen in the box for the link to present the number rather than having it glow.


    #### (Project Name) - Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/ab-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

(description)
  The job for this project was to replicate the design given to us in the comp and make it reponsive for both large and small screens. This time I didn't focus much on the creative aspect and spent more time making sure that my work looked like the comp.

  Some points of feedback I recieved were to focus on getting more aria labels into my code, and sift through the CSS to see if I had any unneccesary statements to clean out my CSS.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)
My Paired projects working with Ricardo in Linked-List, Melena in Idea-box, and Melissa in 2Do-Box

#### (Project Name) - Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

(description)
  This website is a collection of internet bookmarks. Users can insert the information for a title and a URL they want to save. This project focused on making sure inputs are recieving information containing the right parameters, and using event bubbling to change the cards since they are not on the page at load.

(evaluation comments)
  Student: Alex & Ricardo
  
  Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
  Notes/What To Work On:

    Can tell there was definite thought put into the user experience by your error messaging, card counter, and clear button.
    
    Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes. Remove animations unless it contributes to functionality.

    YAY for tracking of issues on your Trello Board. Move over to Waffle so the issues are trackable on your GitHub repo.

    Good use of branches and comments on your PRs.

    Be sure to implement other pieces of ARIA - alt, lang, labels on inputs.

    Appreciate your clustering of related properties for organizing your CSS!

    Opportunities for refactoring in JS - long functions and some redundancy (118-140). Return is not neccessary for if/else blocks in inputValidator. Lines 43-45 don't appear to be doing anything. Both could speak to code.

(feedback to me)

  Alex is meant to be a programmer. He has a very logical approach to problem-solving and an innate ability to see solutions amongst what appears to be a chaos of code on the screen. He communicates great and is very open to changes. He can be almost too accepting of someone's input, even when he might otherwise know a better way. There were a few occasions where someone with a slightly more overbearing approach to interactions (like myself), were able to pull him out of a moment where he was clearly focused on a task or writing code. Rather than telling me to hold on a minute or simply tell me to go away, he allowed himself to be pulled away from a thought. Being a little more assertive with his focus would allow him to stay on task and not be distracted by sometimes superfluous ideas. On a tight deadline, that could end up causing an issue if he's paired with someone who's prone to creating distractions. Would recommend partnering with him, 10/10 times!

#### (Project Name) - Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

(description)
  Idea Box was our first experience with Local Storage. This was very similar to Linked list in that we were creating cards out of user input. The Boxes in idea box needed to have an up-vote, down-vote, and search function. 

(evaluation comments)
  Student: Alex and Melena
  
  Evaluator: David

  Notes/What To Work On:

  COMP
    Button had border radius
    x button did not stay when long title was used

  HTML
    Always include dependency libraries in your git repos(this one loads jquery from another dir)

    Probably makes sense to wrap both the form and appended ideas sectionin the main element as they are both a part of the primary content of the page.

  CSS
    Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
    
    Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces
  
  JS
    Work on passing objects instead of object properties
    
    Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card

    Work on spacing in parameters/arguments

    Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops

    Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

  
(evaluation scores)
  Functional Expectations
    
    Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
  
  HTML
  
  Accessibility
  
    Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
  
    Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.
  
  Style
  
    Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
  
  CSS
  Structure of Code
  
    Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
  
    Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
  
  Implementation
  
    Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
  
  JAVASCRIPT
  
  Data Types
    
    Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
  
  Conditional Logic
  
    Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
  
  Functions & Scope
    
    Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
  
  Arrays
  
    Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
  
    Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
  
  Objects & Prototypes
  
    Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
  
    Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
  
  DOM Manipulation
  
    Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
  
  Style
  
    Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
  
  GIT & GITHUB
  Git
  
    Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
  
    Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
  
  Github
  
    Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
  
  DESIGN
  Comp Recreation
  
    Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
  
    Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
  
  PAIRING
  Collaboration
  
    Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
  
    Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

(feedback to me)

  Alex! I think this was overall a very successful pairing. I really enjoyed working with you: you were wonderful about getting things done and I appreciated your determination to finish everything and do a great job (which we totally did yay!). I felt like we really hit our stride and had good communication. We talked about this, but in the future if you are not understanding something as it's happening I think it is perfectly ok to ask to stop and talk about what you're working on. It's great that you want to keep making progress, and at the same time it seemed that you got a lot more out of our work time once we had stopped to make sure we were on the same page! You said that you were worried about holding the project back and that was never a concern that I had. And since one of our biggest stated goals for the project was learning and understanding everything we did you have every right to make sure that happens. We definitely got there eventually and that is great - next time I think you can ask that it happen sooner :) Great project though! I'm so proud of the work we got done and I learned a ton working with you. Thank you!
  
#### (Project Name) - To Do Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lexbonder/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(description)
  This project started with refactoring another student's Idea Box and turning it into To Do Box. We then added new features to the cards such as more qualities for the up-vote and down-vote buttons, and a "mark as completed" button.

  Notes/What To Work On:
    nice work on colors and active states for filtering
    Not through crossing things out
  
  comp
    could have bigger title and empty state messages
  
  html
    looked great, weird to have numerical ids
  
  css
    borderline exceptional
  
  js
    nice job organizing - you set a criteria and spoke to it
    creating an object from an object is weird
    naming conventions could use work
    decoupling data from markup
  
  git/github
    could work on more commits and more verbose commits
    take the extra time to get into a habit

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name) - Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

  The growth mindset gear up was an interesting one. I like the idea that I can always be improving and I found it very interesting that schools implementing growth mindset led to such a drastic difference in education quality.

  I find that I use growth mindset very often in my training for a half marathon and weight loss journey. As I have been exercising I keep in mind that pushing until failure is the ultimate victory. I have adapted this lesson into many other ventures in my life including my education at turing. Education at turing is about the journey, and learning how to find the answer rather than knowing the answer.

#### (Session Name) - Introversion vs. Extroversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

  I thought this session was interesting because it shows that different personality types handle things in different ways but I also think it can force a divide among the students. We're, in a way, split into "introverts" "extroverts" and "inbetween". But I feel that no person is consistently in one of those bubbles. It can change depending on the context. I'm an extrovert when I'm out with my friends, but when I'm surrounded by strangers I can be more of an introvert. I feel like people grabbed on to those labels and it may have altered their thoughts or actions based on the role they feel they need to play now.

#### (Session Name) - Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

  This session spoke to me a lot for the same reason growth mindset did. In my running, and my weight loss, I'm attempting every day to get better at difficult things. This session explained that the easiest way to learn a new skill, no matter how hard, is repetition. When you do something over and over, it is inevitable that you're going to get better at it. The important thing though, during repetition is to develop good habits. If you pracitce doing something wrong, you can get stuck doing things the wrong way.

#### (Session Name) - Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

  Debugging the Gender Gap was a very interesting session. I feel like the video we watched had a large number of very important things that needed to be fixed. There definitely is an institutionalized difference in the workplace between men and women. Thankfully the differences are being noticed and change is beginning to happen. As a straight, white, male I feel like it is my duty to not perpetuate the inequalities that have been ruling society for so long. As we discussed in class, the best thing to do is speak up if something isn't right, which I fully intend to do in the workplace. The session didn't change my mind about the issue, I felt this way before I knew how big of an issue it was. The video did open my eyes to exactly how big of a problem it is, so now I know how important it is to be part of the solution, and not stand idly by and let myself become part of the problem.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
  As a newbie to the community there wasn't a whole lot that I could do to give back, but I did make an attempt to attend as many of Turings events as possible. In the first few weeks I went to the Health and Wellness lunch. It was a good source for interesting information. I have attended every Wrap Up session, and I will be going to demo night. During week 5 I even went to yoga! I'm planning next mod to go to yoga every week, and to start going to Impostors lunch. I might also push some life into the Board Gamers channel, it's quite quiet in there. I also intend to give a lightning talk next mod. Perhaps about sticking to commitments, or finding inspiration. I think as someone in their first 6 weeks I made a good effort to leave the classroom and take part of the community.
