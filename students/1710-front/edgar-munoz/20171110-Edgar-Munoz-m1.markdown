# Edgar Eloy Munoz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to push myself to grow in a multitude of facets. Firstly, I came into Turing having zero experience with any coding languages. But through my first six weeks here I have proven myself as an adaptable quick learner. I have found solutions where I didn't know I could through sheer determination. Secondly, I came to Turing having been out of school for 8 years, having dealt with mental illness, unsure if I could even handle a program where I had to interact with 21 other brilliant people everyday. But I did it. Some days my anxiety got the best of me but I was truly able to put myself out there and get to better know my AMAZING cohort. Thirdly, I knew that grinding was going to be a challenge for me, but I stuck with it. When my partners needed me I was there and I stayed and worked for as long as they needed me. I wanted to be a stalwart for my pairing partners and I feel that I succeeded. After 51/2 weeks I can say that I firmly grasp HTML, am displaying an upward trajectory with CSS, and am only becoming better at Javascript/JQuery at an increasing rate.

**Evaluation Comments**
- make sure you understand your entire codebase. it is better to get less of the functionality built and really understand all of it that to get a lot of built but not be able to confidently speak to what you've done.
- force yourself to use vanilla JS -- don't rely on jQuery for everything. jQuery is a tool that is helpful, but you can't use it in every situation and having a solid handle on plain ol' javascript is very important.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/criteriamor/em-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

My first Static Comp was a catastrophe. I had very little awareness of the resizing aspect of different sized screens, so went into my presentation expecting to see what I saw on my macbook, only to see squished boxes. Nora said it best when she made the comment that it was "very avant-garde". This Comp taught me that resizing is real and that I *needed* to see my project on a big screen before presentation. It also set me on my ongoing journey to create and improve my mobile layouts.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/criteriamor/em-static-comp-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

*Static Comp 2* showed my growth and ability to implement feedback, while turning a moment of failure into a motivating factor for improvement. I improved on the responsiveness of my page from the last Static Comp. I was able to build my first mobile layout. I focused on the cleanness of the cards themselves, making them very close to the given example. Overall, I showed great improvement and an upward trajectory.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/criteriamor/em-static-comp-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

*Static Comp 3* presented a new challenge of building a complex layout and maintaining its integrity through variously sized screens. Although I do believe that I have continued to improve with my Static Comps, I recognize that there is still ever more room for growth. I was missing a few buttons and the margin on my bar-graph was shaky. I may have made a mistake by stretching the social media buttons in order to fill the white space on the right side of the page which also affected the bar graph's margin and its button cutting off the bottom border of the graph section.

These are all problems that I can see solving and are a result of crunch time. I don't believe they reflect a lack of ability but just a lack of time.

My media queries were not to Pam's satisfaction and those are something that I am continuing to improve upon. I hope to show you a revamped and improved mobile layout soon.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In Mod 1 I completed 4 group projects: *Linked-List* with Casey Dallavalle, *IdeaBox* with Valentino Valentine, and *2DoBox Pivot* with Parker Lindley.

**Evaluation Comments**

##### comp

Great job implementing the comp!
Could improve ui by putting error messages under appropriate input fields

##### html

Work on more consistent spacing and indentation in html
Always put script tags in the bottom of the body
Looks like an unused jquery was install via npm
Use labels around input fields instead of p tags

##### css

Try to avoid important flags
Break comma separated declarations onto multiple lines and only adding specific things to media queries
No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only

##### javascript

Good use of global vs local variables
Could use indentation and spacing combthrough
Be more verbose when naming vars and functions

##### git/github

Like that I'm seeing a lot of commits, but would like to see more commit messages and have those commits tell a story

**Feedback From Casey**
>Edgar and I had a very successful project! At first, we started switching between driver and navigator. This was a fairly slow process and I think we were both a little frustrated with our progress. I appreciated that Edgar and I found a better way to divide the work. Edgar is a smart, dedicated student. I am thankful for his eagerness to get the work done promptly and his hard work to understand and use the tools available to us. He helped walk me through GitHub and also pushed me to use it more - which I very much needed! I know that I can talk a lot, so I tried to ask questions to make sure Edgar had the space to speak his mind. I sometimes felt like he was holding frustrations and feelings back when I was asking for input. In these instances, I would've been happy to discuss anything on Edgar's mind to make sure we working in a way he was comfortable with. That being said, I really enjoyed working with Edgar and getting to know him!

#### IdeaBox

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

**Evaluator: Pam**

**Evaluation Comments**

- Majority of functionality met! Still some fixes to make - quality and edits on title/body do not persist. Ideas are appending to bottom, not prepending to top. No error handling, can create blank cards with no title and/or body.

- Design stays true to the spirit of the comp. Watch spacing and finer details.

- Would like to see more commits. Also, be sure to follow the conventions for commits.

- Good indentation in HTML file! Spacing between lines can be distracting. Be sure to implement ARIA with lang attribute, labels, etc.

- Run through CSS selectors w/dev tools to be sure that every line is doing something - 18 declarations that aren't doing anything for the layout. Do NOT flex your entire layout.

- Be sure that you know your code and can speak to it. Review the difference between parameters/arguments and global/local scope.

Get rid of those spaces!!
weirdness with jquery
blue background

#####js

variable names are better - more appropriate
did function expression for constructor function
start trying to pass around objects instead of object properties

#####git/github

Sooo many commits! Love it!
Good declarative commit messages
consider adding a body

**Feedback from Parker**
>Edgar, it was awesome having you as a partner! I loved that we did the dtr and for the most part met the goals and stuck to the schedule. I really appreciate that you were willing to put in the work, stay late, and crank out some truly fantastic JS and problem solving all while we had a million other things to focus on. I'm really proud of our project and glad that you were there late into the the night to fully understand what each bit was doing. You're a fast learner and I like that you ask questions but don't have to repeat them. Not being able to read minds I'd like to know more what you're thinking sometimes and for you to to voice out whatever is going on. Other than that, thanks for the hard work, the walks through union station, and being a solid pair partner. I think you're going to make out to be a great developer and I hope we get to work on further projects in the future, whether a project for school, or a personal project to help civic and community engagement. Sorry i stole your phone charger.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

Developing a growth mindset is something I continue to work on. I don't believe that there are any limitations to what I can do but in the real world and because of my anxiety I do wrestle with real time doubts. I understand the value of having a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset but its implementation for someone struggling with a mental illness is a struggle and I sometimes wonder whether one could be beat in the head with growth mindset demands...

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

Casey said something interesting to me about this GearUp session. She said that although we recognized that Introversion and Extroversion were on a spectrum that our treatment of them in the GearUp still felt too dichotomous. This led me to reflect on what introversion and extroversion being on a spectrum really meant. I fell in around the middle of the spectrum, leaning towards extroversion, and I have seen myself sometimes being an extrovert and sometimes wanting to be left completely by myself. I would prefer to be more extroverted more of the time and that's something I will work towards.

#### Strengths & Storytelling
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

This GearUp is an important one to me because I feel that my story is still shaping itself. Depending on where we stand in the present we will choose to highlight different parts of our story, creating new and varied versions of our past, of what brought us here. *All* of our past led us to here but the way we animate that past when we explain it to others is something so perplexing and interesting to me. Things I felt were monumental a few years ago, I glossed over during this session to make room for other experiences and development points that I felt were more relevant. Continuing to shape my story and *build* the identity I present professionally will be an ongoing task.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

It was great to see women in tech go into detail when describing their experiences with sexism in the workplace. I believe that in order to change our environments, we cannot shy away from the ugly details. Every ugly sinew, piece of dirt, and crevice needs to be examined in order for us to clean up our act as a species. Others can *focus* on the positives but my special talent is finding what's wrong and pointing it out. So I love this and I want more.


#### Taking Yourself Less Seriously w/Mod 4

I went into this GearUp expecting a silly raucous hour, which is what I needed after being so serious for a week, but it was actually a serious talk about letting loose. I think that talk was useful for other students but I learn more from direct experience than from instruction and I feel like maybe an opportunity was lost? The mustaches were a good start.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel like my participation in the Turing community has been very substantial, especially for someone who was an anxiety ridden agoraphobic hermit just a couple years ago.

Right away, in week one, I was able to open a new door for my mod by openly expressing that I had cried to Allison during a GearUp. I think I set the tone for openness and helped clear a path towards vulnerability that has made the bond between Mod 1 students the new bar and standard. 

I have participated in LGBTQ/QueerQoders organization by going to a meeting. 

I have actively reached out to mentors and alumni. When I heard from Jeff Bender on our night to together with other Mod students (Frontend and Backend) that the mentors were sitting their unused, just waiting to help current students, I took the iniative and made contact with one of them.

I participated in a PAHLKA meeting and made a connection to PAHLKA alumni to hear directly fromm them what their mission for starting PAHLKA was, learning immensely about goal splitting, organized dynamism, and the constant reiteration of PAHLKA.

I made my presence known by sticking my neck out, taking risks to ask questions in front of my peers, and making sure that I asked the hard questions, not because I'm mad or feel like I have something to prove, but because I know that somebody has to and it might as well be me. I asked Megan a question about inclusivity for women when there wasn't even a question portion to her talk and to the chagrin of Jeff. I created that moment because I felt like I had to. I had to set a tone and I had to make a connection with her and everybody else in the room to let them know that somebody was fighting for equality. Many people reached out to me since then to thank me for speaking and to complement me on my concise and well-developed question. When it comes to justice, my anxiety is melted away by my sense of duty.

Every opportunity that has been presented to me to connect and to contribute to greater Turing, I have taken because I want to contribute. I don't want to just come and leave. I want to make a difference, leave my mark, and continue to push the Turing snowball forward.
