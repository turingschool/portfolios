# Casey Dallavalle - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I spent a lot of time on array prototypes and interacting with nested data types, both in class, in Iron FE and individual study. I feel competent with using the prototypes and accessing data in nested objects and arrays. I also worked with react for the first time and learned so much about how the library works. I'm still a total beginner so I have a lot to learn, but my introduction to react has made me excited to learn more and delve into it further.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I had a rough end to the module. My pairing was challenging but also a really good learning experience. In the past projects, I have always done most, if not all, of the javascript in the project with a partner. The projects are now just getting too big to handle doing the entire thing together. I think in the future, I need to include splitting up at least some of the project in order to fully complete everything. But, I did really like using react! Also, I feel good about my final exam. I studied a lot all throughout the mod and feel good about it.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I worked on were the Sorting-Suite and Complete-Me assignments. I also created a Harry Potter Object exercise for the class to practice with!

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/sorting-algs)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

In the Sorting Suite, I coded four sorting algorithms: bubble, insertion, merge and quick sort. This was a very fun and challenging exercise. Sorting large  amounts of data was kind of hard to wrap my head around, but after lots of practice with the cards and walking through it with my class, I feel like I have a good comprehension of it. I'm also glad to have the knowledge to review before job interviews!

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

In Complete-Me, I created an prefix trie in order to use it for an autocomplete function. The trie was populated with a dictionary of words using an insert method of the trie. When a user inputs a string fragment, the method suggest is used to create an array of suggested words that start with the string fragment. When a word is selected, and the user inputs the same string fragment, the word they last selected is sorted to appear first.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects this mod were GameTime and Weatherly. For GameTime, I worked with Melena Suilteanu and for Weatherly, I worked with Valentino Valentine. Each project was enjoyable and challenging in it's own way.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game time went really great. Melena and I have a very similar level of javascript expertise, so we did pretty much all of the project together. I felt like we had a really good project, that looked great and worked pretty great for the two weeks we had. We chose to recreate the game [WinterBells](http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/winterbells/) in a space theme. The webpage displays instructors for the user to read and then a start button. When the button is clicked, a ufo shows up on the bottom of the screen and planets start falling down the screen. The ufo can jump on planets to get points and level up. When the ufo misses a planet and falls off the screen, the user loses the game and is asked whether they want to play again.

### Evaluator: 
Leta

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints



## (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weatherly was used in React and was my first project in school working with the library. It was very challenging but also fun to learn how to work with it. The app displays a welcome page that prompts the user to input a city or a zip code. If the user inputs a false input, then an error displays saying that city was not found. If the user inputs a city or a zip code, then a call to the api is made and the current weather, the weather for the next seven days, and the weather for the next ten days is displayed. An input and button is at the top of the page, if a person wants to see the weather for a different page. Autocomplete is used for the city input and there is a full testing suite for all the functionality.

### Evaluator: 
Leta

#### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

* 3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/SASS style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### JavaScript Style / React Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* 3.5 3 - Five or fewer complaints



#### Community Gearup (w/ Mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_5.md)

This Gearup was a combination of talking about the attention economy and also net neutrality. I liked learning about net neutrality a lot, but I felt like because that was and still is such a big issue in our present day, everything else that people had questions about kind of got swept under the rug. However, I learned more about net neutrality and I am very appreciate of that as well!

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)

I LOVED this gear up! I thought the movie was a great starting point for a discussion about the attention economy and how it effects every one of us. My group had really thoughtful points and it was interesting to hear everyone's opinion on who (the user or the company) holds the responsibility of participating in the attention economy.

#### Empathy and Privilidge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This was also a fantastic gear up. I really liked starting with the going through the list of situations that you may or may not have experienced in your life. Then after filling those out, we had a small group discussion about those situations where you could pick one to talk about. This allowed me to get to know others in my group and talk about how we were, and still are, effected by the privlege we may (or may not) have. This was a great gear up, and I think it really got all of us thinking and trying to be more aware of ourselves.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel like I played a big part in the Turing community this mod! I went to Iron FE, JCS, pahlka, paired with mod 1 folks, met with two Turing alums and started a mentorship with them. I also was an SAB rep this mod, so I went to the Thursday SAB lunches and relayed the information to my mod in Retro. I have really enjoyed getting to be a part of the Turing community. I have learned so much from everyone I interact with and am very grateful for it!
