# Casey Dallavalle - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to become proficient in working with React, as well as, work on refactoring my code and become skilled in TDD.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed. I was especially proud of the final assesment project. I felt like I turned in a complete project that was thoroughly tested, linted and fully functional. I also do love my personal project! I've been working on it since the eval and I think that it is a fun application that people would enjoy using.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I worked on were Swapibox and GameBoard.

#### Swapibox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Swapibox used the Star Wars api and was designed to get us experienced in creating and reusing React components, as well as, making multiple nested fetch calls. I created a website from the Empire's pespective, where Galatic employees can find information about the people and planets they wish to target and the vehicles they can ride on. I thoroughly enjoyed this project and was proud of my finished product because of the website design, the code quality and the testing.

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.


### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow


3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### GameBoard

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/gameboard)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

In this solo project, I designed and implemented a website that allows users to keep track of the board games they own, rate them, and see what their friends are playing! Using React.js, React-Router, Redux and Google Firebase, my app seeks to let new board game users come and start building a community with other board game users, so users can see what games are highly rated and what games their friends own that they can play together.

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The two group projects I worked on this mod were Headcount 2.0 with Alex Bonder and Movie Tracker with Jordan Quinn and Matt Renn.

#### (Headcount 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a paired project designed to challenge our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components for the Turing School of Software & Design. My partner Alex Bonder and I were given data about Colorado kindergarten school performances to dynamically present in a user friendly fashion. Cards are appended to the page and can be compared to discover the similarities between the school averages. A search bar at the top right allows users to search for the school district they are looking for. The project is built using React.js and contains a full testing suite using Jest and Enyme for TDD.

## Specification Adherence

- 3.5 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

* 4 - Zero complaint

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Surprise and Delight

- 2 - Sparkles

#### (Movie-Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbdallavalle/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project was a three person paired project for the Turing School of Software and Design, using React.js, React-Router and Redux and required working with two databases, one online the MovieDB API and the other a backend created by the Turing staff using POSTGRESQL and deployed with Node, located at the Github repo provided above. The website we created pulls movies from the MovieDB API and displays them for users to scroll through to discover new movies. The user can create an account and log in and sign out with an email, name and password. The user can also favorite movies, which they can view in the favorites tab on the website.

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## D: Professional Skills

This mod I worked on building a solid resume and cover letter, as well as, creating a good personal story pitch. I still get quite nervous when I am talking about myself to other developers that I have talked to, so I definitely want to work on projecting confidence in the skills I have. I also have quite a few coffee/drink plans with upcomming developers so I will have a chance to build my network and also work on my nerves.

### Gear Up
#### (Avoiding Burnout)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_2.md)

This was a very valuable gear up. I feel like we had some really good discussions about how different people have different paths to burn out and the multitude of ways we can recover from burn out. I definitely did not know how to recognize the symptoms in myself and feel like I came out of this session with a better awareness of how my work effects my cognitive resources.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I led one JCS session where we made notecards with advice for the upcoming folks in the mods we just finished.
I met with mentors to have my code reviewed. And I also met with several Turing alumn to build my network.
