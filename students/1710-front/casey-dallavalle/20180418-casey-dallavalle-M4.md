#### Story

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Two things! The first is winning the GoCode CO hackathon! I had such a fantastic weekend working with my group and really loved the product we built.

I was pleased that I could learn enough Clojure over a week to advance with Democracy Works. Being able to jumo into another language and after a week, be in a place where I felt like I understood how Clojure works and how a small application was running in it was a really wonderful feeling! It just showed me how much I have come from the first few weeks of Mod1.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

The biggest struggle was finding a balance between doing job stuff and class work. At the start of the mod I felt like I was just going going on the job front. Setting up coffees, sending in applications, going to meet ups. In the middle of the mod I just got completely burned out. I decided to take a step back and relax on the job stuff. Instead of setting up meetings and sending in job applications, I just focused on the few interviews I had and school. I feel much more refreshed and ready to get hustling on the job front again.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

Winning GoCode! I'm really excited to put that on my resume.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

This is a good question! I really appreciated learning the back end. I felt like my knowledge of code was just completely solidified because I was able to relate the material I have learned from the first three mods with the things I learned from this mod. Now, I feel like my knowledge of how applications work and how the web works is much more complete.

I definitely realized that I love the front end. I really enjoy working in React and I do enjoy design. In my next job, I hope to continue building upon my front end development skills and become a kick ass designer.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Skill. Discipline. Hustle.

Skill - I am confident in my skills to think like a coder. I know that I can tackle any problem I may encounter by leaning on the knowledge I already have and use the problem solving methods I have been practicing for the past 7 months. 

Discipline - I know that I will continue to work every day, both on the job hunt and building upon my coding skills. When I get a job, I will carry that discipline to be the best employee I can be.

Hustle - Working hard gets you to the places that you want to be. I will work tirelessly to refine my skills, commit to my  goals, and get to where I want to be. The world is run by those who show up!
