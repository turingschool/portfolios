# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had a couple of goals this module that I have definitely made some progress on. Maybe not so much a goal, but I was not entirely certain that I was going to love programming and I definitely did not feel like I belonged here. I guess I had a major case of the imposter's syndrom, which made me feel quite uncomfortable in the first couple of weeks. My drive to succeed in any type of school setting made me work hard to learn as much as I could and aim to do well on the assignments I was given. After the first few weeks, I realized that I really really liked coding and that I was doing well! Suddenly, I felt much more confident in my choice to attend Turing and I am so glad and thankful for this program. I also have learned so much. I know that I am nowhere near to the skill level I will have at the end of Mod 4, but I have accomplished getting a baseline knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I have 4 individual projects included in my portfolio. My assignments include the three CSS design challenges and the one individual project I worked on called Number Guesser. The design challenges gave me an image of a website I needed to recreate using just HTML and CSS. The project number guesser challenged me to create a webpage using only vanilla javascript to create a webpage that lets the user try to guess a random number and then if solved, creates a harder game. 

#### Static Comp Challenge One

GitHub Url: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-1/
Original Assignment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I chose my topic as the Wind River Range and supplied my own picture from my travels. I chose my color palette from the colors in my photograph and found a font to match the outdoors theme. I break my webpage up using two media queries, having mobile as the default and then selecting specific parameters to change as the screen enlarges. Below, I have included the image I was tasked to replicate and a screenshot of my own webpage.


Evalutaion comments:
    -Colors a little brighter
    -typeface with a little more personality
    -more space around text in buttons
    -watch margins - watch for cozy text

#### Static Comp Challenge Two

GitHub Url: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-2/
Original Assignment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I am an avid pokemon lover, so I chose to recreate this challenge by replacing each profile with a pokemon card! I decided to give the cards a fixed width and height so they stay consistent when the webpage changes. I put a display of flex on the container that holds the cards, so that when the webpage is condensed, the cards that would be cut off by the window, instead drop down to create a new row. On mobile, only one card is shown in each row, creating a total of 8 rows. I also removed the text navigation options in favor for the logos because the text was quite small and distracted from the layout.

Evalutaion comments:
   -Breathing room between icon and texts and on hover state have both icon and text change together
   -Stick to 2 typefaces
   -Change login to look like it's part of the page
   -Adjust header bar
   -Heavy drop shadows - tighten them up and don’t do black
   -No outline on text
   -Same distance between cards on the bottom
   -Mess with background image to make it seem like less of an important part of the webpage


#### Static Comp Challenge Three

GitHub Url: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-3/
Original Assignment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

Our assignment for this challenge was to recreate a website based off of an image. The image they gave us had a website that was in a desktop format, so the mobile and large screen format was up to each student. We were allowed to take liberties with the subject matter of the website, the images, and text but not with the format. I chose to do my project on the Harry Potter books. I had the user information as the sorting hat, who was looking at the profile of Hermione Granger. The graphs represent her personality in two forms: her house affinities and her myers-brigg personality score. The rest of the website contains information about her and/or the wizarding world. I would like to work on getting the connect container (the one that containers the social media buttons and the options to copy links) to be the same size as the table container. I also want to continue working on fluidity in a website design. Below I have the image I was tasked to recreate and the webpage I made.


Evaluation comments:
   -Make sure to go back and carefully check original website layout
   -The two bottom-most containers, the one with the graph and the one with the social media buttons, should be the same height
   -Too much white space in the big screen format - to combat that, make the graphs bigger
   -Page break should go across the entier width of the page
   -Breathing room for buttons on top right

#### Number Guesser

GitHub URL: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/numberGuesser/
Original Assesment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

In the Number Guesser project I was given a desktop image to recreate and then was responsible for the functionality of a number guessing game. The javascript randomly picked a number and then allowed the users to guess what number was picked. Depending on what the user picked, the js would return a different message saying their number was too high or low or spot on.

## C: Group Work & Projects

I have 3 group projects in my portifolio. The three paired projects I did are Linked List, Idea-Box and 2Do List. These projects were iterations of each other, each getting harder and incorporating more elements. Linked List had us create cards with information given to us by the user. Idea-box made us store each card created in local storage and access them in multiple situations. In 2Do Box, we used another person's code to create the project. We were responsible for understanding another's code, refactoring it, and using it to create our own functionality.

#### Linked List

Github URL: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/Link-List-Merged/
Original Assignment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

In this project I paired with Edgar. We completed a very successful DTR in the beginning of our project that really helped guide us through our project. This was the first time I had used jQuery, which Edgar had already been using for the last project, so this was the perfect situation and project to help introduce me to jQuery. Our goal was to have a two inputs for a title and a body on one half of the page (in desktop view) and on the other half of the page, a column for cards to be created with that information. 

#Evaluation comments:
Student: Casey and Edgar

Evaluator: David

Notes/What To Work On:

#comp

Great job implementing the comp!
Could improve ui by putting error messages under appropriate input fields

#html

Work on more consistent spacing and indentation in html
Always put script tags in the bottom of the body
Looks like an unused jquery was install via npm
Use labels around input fields instead of p tags

#css

Try to avoid important flags
Break comma separated declarations onto multiple lines and only adding specific things to media queries
No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only

#javascript

Good use of global vs local variables
Could use indentation and spacing combthrough
Be more verbose when naming vars and functions
git/github

Like that I'm seeing a lot of commits, but would like to see more commit messages and have those commits tell a story

Feedback to me:
I thought Casey was the best first partner I could possibly have. We bonded, met up early on the weekends, went for walks around Cap Hill together, she showed me her plants! I mean literally dream team. I really don't have any criticisms. She picked up where I was weak. She foresaw problems and resolved them (Github). For coaching, I suggest that she could discuss with her partner beforehand how they will take responsibility for a project as a team, since we did delegate tasks. I understand being afraid to trust or merge someone elses code, but for me, it didn't feel great when my partner didn't extend their confidence over to my part of the project as with the HTML that was discussed as just being mine during the eval. Overall, we got our project done and it was dope. #TeamCayger

####Idea-Box

GitHub URL: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/idea-box/
Original Assessment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

We created a design that replicated the one given to us which was responsive on different screen sizes. We learned how to commit information into local storage, access that information, and then use it and change it on the screen. This allowed us to successfully append cards that had information stored in local storage and change them if the user wanted. Also, if the user deletes the card it is removed from the page, as well as, local storage. Lastly, we created a search function that searches for the letters or word the user is looking for and displays the cards that only contain the search input.

Evaluation Comments:
Student: Casey and Sabrina

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes/What To Work On:

CSS uses percentages for height, use a different unit of measure. This can cause very unpredictable behavior/movement/scaling as a user resize the browser window and when you are building more complex UI it will be a major headache.
JS is in a good place for a refactor.
good work!

Evaluation Scores:
#Functional Expectations

Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

#HTML

-Accessibility

Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

-Style

Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
#CSS

-Structure of Code

Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

-Implementation

Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#JAVASCRIPT

-Data Types

Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

-Conditional Logic

Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

-Functions & Scope

Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

-Arrays

Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

-Objects & Prototypes

Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

-DOM Manipulation

Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

-Style

Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

#GIT & GITHUB

-Git

Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
Github

Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

#DESIGN

-Comp Recreation

Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#PAIRING

-Collaboration

Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

Feedback to me:
Casey was a wonderful partner and I really got a lot out of working with her. Casey did a great job problem solving the issues that came up with Javascript while working on IdeaBox. I appreciate her detail mind when it came to writing functions and understand how they where working. She did a great job helping move the project forward.

####2DoBox-Pivot

GitHub URL: https://cbdallavalle.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/
Original Assessment URL: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

This project was a continuation of the idea-box project except that we were using another group's code. This was extremely interesting and awesome because it gave us a look into what it is like to review another team member's code and change/refactor it without rewritting the base functionality. On top of refactoring, we were also given tasks to change the content from centering around keeping track of ideas to keeping track of a list of to dos. We also were asked to give the website some new functionality, that utilized array prototypes.

Evaluation comments:
Student: Bruce & Casey

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Notes/What To Work On:

Design is pretty accurate. Fully responsive. Move 'show more' button down to bottom or make it obvious to the user that more cards have been added off-screen.

Add indication on hover that buttons are clickable. Text on the buttons themselves is kind of large.

YAY for completing 2/3 of the extensions!

Be sure to have a DTR next time. Glad to hear that pairing went well without having one in place.

Good naming on commits/branches.

Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good spacing/indentation. And HOORAY for forms!!!

Add lang attribute to HTML. Be sure to add ARIA to dynamically rendered HTML in JS file.

Next time, use a screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader. The contrast on the filter buttons is not sufficient, per accessibility testing.

CSS could use a quick pass for refactor. Just under 20 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading stylesheets and inheritance. Outline-style is none by default.

JS file is pretty good overall. Easy to follow logic and code is pretty readable. Nice use of array prototypes in some functionality! Very little redundancy - love how you combined functionality for editing title/task and changing importance. Areas for refactoring below:

Lines 18-22 could be refactored into single event listener by passing in $(this).text() as argument instead of hardcoded string (being sure to adjust for case-sensitivity).

Unnecessary parameters placed (importance and completed) in line 74.

Feedback for me:
Great work on this project! Thanks for inviting me to your house saturday and giving me healthy foods that I was lacking! I appreciate that you were willing to meet early Sat morning and get the refactoring out of the way. We faced a challenge because Stranger Things came out, and we had to navigate the project knowing there would be at least 10 or so lost hours. The project went really smoothly and was stress-free overall.  I think that we should have communicated about our preference for driver-navigator earlier! We certainly hit a groove once you started your preferred role in driving and me in navigating. Maybe its a sign we should have DTR'd.. Anyways, I enjoyed pairing with you and we were really efficient in getting through our work. Hope to see you again in later pairings.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

Gearup 1: I love the focus Turing has on having a growth mind set. It is so easy to get down on yourself and say I can't do it, but learning the cues to recognize when you are having a fixed mindset and to remind yourself that learning this stuff is possible is very useful and positive. 

Gearup 2: My favorite part about this gear up was the line at the end of the article we read: The Struggle is the norm. May it ever be thus. One of my strengths is learning, so I really thrive on the struggle. I love learning new things and challenging myself, but not always mastering those things. 

Gearup 3: 
The third and fourth Gear Up sessions stuck with me the most. In the third session, we watched a video about cognitive resources and perception learning. It never occurred to me to watch others code to enhance my own skills, and I love the idea of it! I also appreciate having the language to talk about the energy levels I have and what I spend my energy on. Lastly, I felt soooo many feelings about the documentary we watched - I am afraid of the culture in the tech industry, but also have a drive to change it. Also, I learned a better way to empathize with people: believe in them and in their stories.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a mod 1 student, I definitely took more from the Turing community than what I gave. The resources that were provided for us were A-mazing! The mod 2 students helping us via pairing and just answering random questions were phenomenal. Iron FE was so interesting and helped me learn much more about array prototypes. JCS was very interesting, comforting, and inspiring to attend. Next mod, I am excited to pay if forward and help the incoming mod 1 students! Though, I did give back a little bit I think! I organized the halloween costume contest which was a success, so yay!
