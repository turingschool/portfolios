\# Casey Dallavalle - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had a couple of goals this module that I have definitely made some progress on. Maybe not so much a goal, but I was not entirely certain that I was going to love programming and I definitely did not feel like I belonged here. I guess I had a major case of the imposter's syndrom, which made me feel quite uncomfortable in the first couple of weeks. My drive to succeed in any type of school setting made me work hard to learn as much as I could and aim to do well on the assignments I was given. After the first few weeks, I realized that I really really liked coding and that I was doing well! Suddenly, I felt much more confident in my choice to attend Turing and I am so glad and thankful for this program. I also have learned so much. I know that I am nowhere near to the skill level I will have at the end of Mod 4, but I have accomplished getting a baseline knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I have 4 individual projects included in my portfolio. My assignments include the three CSS design challenges and the one individual project I worked on called Number Guesser. The design challenges gave me an image of a website I needed to recreate using just HTML and CSS. The project number guesser challenged me to create a webpage using only vanilla javascript to create a webpage that lets the user try to guess a random number and then if solved, creates a harder game. 

### Number Guesser
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/numberGuesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Description
In the Number Guesser project I was given a desktop image to recreate and then was responsible for the functionality of a number guessing game. The javascript randomly picked a number and then allowed the users to guess what number was picked. Depending on what the user picked, the js would return a different message saying their number was too high or low or spot on. I challenged myself to add a fun component and changed the number guesser to make it into a counting game for kiddos. When a user guessed a number, images of barn animals would show up and the user had to count them to guess again. It was quite fun!

#### Evaluated By: Pam
Notes/What To Work On:
- Love your animal counter!
-Be sure to fix spacing/nesting in HTML for readability. Continue incorporating ARIA - hooray!
-Use shorthand in CSS when possible. Find a way to organize your CSS idiomatically and stay consistent
-Work on more robust naming in JS

### Static Comp 1
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

#### Description
The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I chose my topic as the Wind River Range and supplied my own picture from my travels. I chose my color palette from the colors in my photograph and found a font to match the outdoors theme. I break my webpage up using two media queries, having mobile as the default and then selecting specific parameters to change as the screen enlarges. Below, I have included the image I was tasked to replicate and a screenshot of my own webpage.

#### Feedback from Louisa:
-Colors a little brighter
-typeface with a little more personality
-more space around text in buttons
-watch margins - watch for cozy text


### Static Comp 2
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

#### Description
The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I am an avid pokemon lover, so I chose to recreate this challenge by replacing each profile with a pokemon card! I decided to give the cards a fixed width and height so they stay consistent when the webpage changes. I put a display of flex on the container that holds the cards, so that when the webpage is condensed, the cards that would be cut off by the window, instead drop down to create a new row. On mobile, only one card is shown in each row, creating a total of 8 rows. I also removed the text navigation options in favor for the logos because the text was quite small and distracted from the layout.

#### Feedback from Louisa:
-Breathing room between icon and texts and on hover state have both icon and text change together
-Stick to 2 typefaces
-Change login to look like it's part of the page
-Adjust header bar
-Heavy drop shadows - tighten them up and donâ€™t do black
-No outline on text
-Same distance between cards on the bottom
-Mess with background image to make it seem like less of an important part of the webpage

### Static Comp 3
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/cd-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

####Description
Our assignment for this challenge was to recreate a website based off of an image. The image they gave us had a website that was in a desktop format, so the mobile and large screen format was up to each student. We were allowed to take liberties with the subject matter of the website, the images, and text but not with the format. I chose to do my project on the Harry Potter books. I had the user information as the sorting hat, who was looking at the profile of Hermione Granger. The graphs represent her personality in two forms: her house affinities and her myers-brigg personality score. The rest of the website contains information about her and/or the wizarding world. I would like to work on getting the connect container (the one that containers the social media buttons and the options to copy links) to be the same size as the table container. I also want to continue working on fluidity in a website design. Below I have the image I was tasked to recreate and the webpage I made.

#### Feedback from Pam:
-Make sure to go back and carefully check original website layout
-The two bottom-most containers, the one with the graph and the one with the social media buttons, should be the same height
-Too much white space in the big screen format - to combat that, make the graphs bigger
-Page break should go across the entier width of the page
-Breathing room for buttons on top right

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are my group projects: Linked List with Edgar Eloy Munoz, IdeaBox with Sabrina Kennedy, and 2DoBox Pivot with Bruce Chung.

### Linked List
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/Link-List-Merged/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Description
Edgar and I completed a very successful DTR in the beginning of our project that really helped guide us through our project. This was the first time I had used jQuery, which Edgar had already been using for the last project, so this was the perfect situation and project to help introduce me to jQuery. The goal of the project was to have a two inputs for a title and a body on one half of the page (in desktop view) and on the other half of the page, a column for cards to be created with that information. 

#### Evaluated By: David

Notes/What To Work On:

#comp

-Great job implementing the comp!
-Could improve ui by putting error messages under appropriate input fields

#html

-Work on more consistent spacing and indentation in html
-Always put script tags in the bottom of the body
-Looks like an unused jquery was install via npm
-Use labels around input fields instead of p tags

#css

-Try to avoid important flags
-Break comma separated declarations onto multiple lines and only adding specific things to media queries
-No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only

#javascript

-Good use of global vs local variables
-Could use indentation and spacing combthrough
-Be more verbose when naming vars and functions
-git/github

-Like that I'm seeing a lot of commits, but would like to see more commit messages and have those commits tell a story

Scores: 
- Functional Expectations = Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
- COMP RECREATION / DESIGN = Proficient
- HTML = Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- CSS = Advanced Beginner/Proficient  
- JS/jQuery = Advanced Beginner/Proficient

#### Partner Feedback from Edgar
I thought Casey was the best first partner I could possibly have. We bonded, met up early on the weekends, went for walks around Cap Hill together, she showed me her plants! I mean literally dream team. I really don't have any criticisms. She picked up where I was weak. She foresaw problems and resolved them (Github). For coaching, I suggest that she could discuss with her partner beforehand how they will take responsibility for a project as a team, since we did delegate tasks. I understand being afraid to trust or merge someone elses code, but for me, it didn't feel great when my partner didn't extend their confidence over to my part of the project as with the HTML that was discussed as just being mine during the eval. Overall, we got our project done and it was dope. #TeamCayger

### IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Description
We created a design that replicated the one given to us which was responsive on different screen sizes. We learned how to commit information into local storage, access that information, and then use it and change it on the screen. This allowed us to successfully append cards that had information stored in local storage and change them if the user wanted. Also, if the user deletes the card it is removed from the page, as well as, local storage. Lastly, we created a search function that searches for the letters or word the user is looking for and displays the cards that only contain the search input.

#### Evaluated by: Louisa
Notes/What To Work On:
-CSS uses percentages for height, use a different unit of measure. This can cause very unpredictable behavior/movement/scaling as a user resize the browser window and when you are building more complex UI it will be a major headache.
-JS is in a good place for a refactor.
-good work!

##### Feedback from Sabrina
Casey was a wonderful partner and I really got a lot out of working with her. Casey did a great job problem solving the issues that came up with Javascript while working on IdeaBox. I appreciate her detail mind when it came to writing functions and understand how they where working. She did a great job helping move the project forward.

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://cbdallavalle.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Description
This project was a continuation of the idea-box project except that we were using another group's code. This was extremely interesting and awesome because it gave us a look into what it is like to review another team member's code and change/refactor it without rewritting the base functionality. On top of refactoring, we were also given tasks to change the content from centering around keeping track of ideas to keeping track of a list of to dos. We also were asked to give the website some new functionality, that utilized array prototypes.

##### Evaluated by: Pam

Notes/What To Work On:
-Design is pretty accurate. Fully responsive. Move 'show more' button down to bottom or make it obvious to the user that more cards have been added off-screen.
-Add indication on hover that buttons are clickable. Text on the buttons themselves is kind of large.
-YAY for completing 2/3 of the extensions!
-Be sure to have a DTR next time. Glad to hear that pairing went well without having one in place.
-Good naming on commits/branches.
-Good use of semantic elements in HTML and ARIA! Good spacing/indentation. And HOORAY for forms!!!
-Add lang attribute to HTML. Be sure to add ARIA to dynamically rendered HTML in JS file.
-Next time, use a screenreader to go through the page. The dynamically added cards are mostly unreadable by the screenreader. The contrast on the filter buttons is not sufficient, per accessibility testing.
-CSS could use a quick pass for refactor. Just under 20 declarations that were unused/not doing anything. Review cascading stylesheets and inheritance. Outline-style is none by default.
-JS file is pretty good overall. Easy to follow logic and code is pretty readable. Nice use of array prototypes in some functionality! Very little redundancy - love how you combined functionality for editing title/task and changing importance. Areas for refactoring below:
-Lines 18-22 could be refactored into single event listener by passing in $(this).text() as argument instead of hardcoded string (being sure to adjust for case-sensitivity).
-Unnecessary parameters placed (importance and completed) in line 74.

##### Feedback from Bruce
Great work on this project! Thanks for inviting me to your house saturday and giving me healthy foods that I was lacking! I appreciate that you were willing to meet early Sat morning and get the refactoring out of the way. We faced a challenge because Stranger Things came out, and we had to navigate the project knowing there would be at least 10 or so lost hours. The project went really smoothly and was stress-free overall.  I think that we should have communicated about our preference for driver-navigator earlier! We certainly hit a groove once you started your preferred role in driving and me in navigating. Maybe its a sign we should have DTR'd.. Anyways, I enjoyed pairing with you and we were really efficient in getting through our work. Hope to see you again in later pairings.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

I love the focus Turing has on having a growth mind set. It is so easy to get down on yourself and say I can't do it, but learning to recognize when you are having a fixed mindset and to remind yourself that learning this stuff is possible is very useful and has a very positive effect on my own wellbeing.


#### Dealing with Difference: Introversion and Extroversion
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

Introversion and extroversion is a really tricky subject to discuss because our personality is who we are, which can be difficult to talk about. Many new studies are shedding light on the genetic parameters of personality and we are figuring out that personality is much more fluid that we originally thought. People do have personality tendancies that they exhibit throughout their lifetime, but personality is very situational and can change depending on the circumstance a person is currently in. I felt the fluidity of personality was missing in this Gear Up. The article we read started off saying that introversion doesn't mean shyness and extroversion doesn't mean people person, but then I felt like it further categorized introverts and extroverts instead of focusing on changing personalities.  

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

My favorite part about this gear up was the line at the end of the article we read: The Struggle is the norm. May it ever be thus. One of my strengths is learning, so I really thrive on the struggle part of tasks. I love learning new things and challenging myself, but I am not always good at mastering those things, which is something I need to get better at!

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I was aware of some of the difficulties involved in being a woman in tech, but watching this video and getting the chance to discuss its implications with my male classmates was valuable. It made me realize that in order to change the overall culture, individuals in tech (of every gender) need to stand up for what is right. I am hoping to be able to stand up against discrimination in the industry once I get into the industry.

#### Case Study with Mod 4: Social Movements in Tech
* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up was focused on how developers can use their own tool set to help our society. We looked at this awesome website called Code For Social Good that links companies and non-profit doing work beneficial for the world to developers who can volunteer their time and skill sets to help those organizations. In the end of the gear up, we had a productive and inspiring group discussion about commitments we can make now and in the future.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a mod 1 student, I definitely took more from the Turing community than what I gave. The resources that were provided for us were A-mazing! The mod 2 students helping us via pairing and just answering random questions were phenomenal. Iron FE was so interesting and helped me learn much more about array prototypes. JCS was very interesting, comforting, and inspiring to attend. Next mod, I am excited to pay if forward and help the incoming mod 1 students! Though, I did give back a little bit I think! I organized the halloween costume contest which was a success, so yay!
