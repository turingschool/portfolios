# Tim Brandle - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Mod 2 was to become familiar with React and SASS. Mod 2 turned out to be a surprise for me and was not what I expected. I've left Mod 2 with much more than an understanding of React. My biggest take aways this mod are more confidence in array prototypes, object oriented programing, test driven development, recursion, and algorithmic thinking

###### Score

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Accessibility

2.5 - The application shows glimpses of good accessibility practices, but fails to deliver a truly accessible product. The application has 4-6 aXe-core violations

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

JavaScript Style

3.5:- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


Utilization of es6

3.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

###### Score

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

Below is the DTR with Becca we created for the Weatherly project.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

[Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was an interesting approach to explaining bias by using shapes instead calling out a specific race or gender. An interesting API that communicated the problem and how the even a small bias could effect the entire community.

#### Universal Based Income
[Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

The UBI discussion was an interesting topic, but I found it difficult to fully jump on board with the idea without a better understanding. UBI seems like a good idea, but the less jobs there are, the more of a division between social class. Its hard to imagine the rich would be willing to support everyone else without a job.

Interesting idea though.

#### Decoding the Gender Gap

I really enjoyed this video.  I think it's easy to get defensive for some people when talking about this issue, but the video did a great job of identifying the problem without pointing fingers.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Becca Holt**

Positive feedback about our pairing:
You were great all around! I appreciated how you didn't shy away from the seemingly difficult tasks and just dove right into the problems. You were always throwing out ideas for solutions and you were open to my suggestions as well.
Constructive criticism about our pairing
I don't really have much to put here. You were great.

### Receiving Feedback

**Ciara Bujanos**

Tim was very patient and took his time to make sure my partner and I understood what we were writing and helped guide us in the right direction when we got stuck. I also really appreciate that on my first project you had a full plate as well but made time to help me figure it out.

I honestly didn't notice anything that I thought could have been better. Thanks for  being so patient!

**Jack Bevis**

First off, given the timing of my pairing request, I can't express enough how great it was for Tim to take time away from his project to help Amanda and I with ours.  I found the pairing session to be very helpful in that Tim didn't tell us what worked for him, but rather help us to explore some possibilities that may work. I also really appreciate the approach of not just giving us an answer, and instead providing some guidance to help us reach some conclusions on our own.

All I can say is I wish there was more time in the pairing sessions, but time is a precious, precious commodity. Thanks Tim.

**Amanda Chavez**

I've paired with Tim three times this Mod - and felt more comfortable with the material after each session. I've had a difficult time picking up JavaScript, and I was really frustrated that I hadn't learned anything. Even though I needed a lot of Tim's guidance, he never directly told me what to do. He would ask me what I thought I should do, have me pseudo code my ideas, and helped me translate my pseudo code to JS. He was very patient with me, and he was able to explain difficult concepts in a variety of ways.

Honestly, I don't have much feedback regarding improvement. It might help to have someone like me (who struggles to speak technically) use as much vocabulary as possible.

**Becca Holt**

You were an amazing project partner! You really pushed me to do my best work. You make very conscious decisions and your refactoring is on-point. You made yourself available and easy to work with.

Don't be afraid to take a break every once in a while! You work so hard, you deserve it!


### Being a Community Member

This mod I attended 3 meetups outside of Turing: CodePen meetup, denverScript, and a meetup on technical interviews.

### Playing a Part

I have made an effort to attend all of the Turing events and guest speakers. Helping my classmates work through problems and explain concepts is another way I was able to contribute to the Turing community. I've paired 7 students from Mod 1.
