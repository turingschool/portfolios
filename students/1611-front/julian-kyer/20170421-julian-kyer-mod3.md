# Julian - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for M3 was to be able to dig deep and build something I was proud to have in my portfolio. I didn't quite expect having to dig as deep as I did, but I learned that I can pick things up much faster than I expected. 

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think I scored a 'cool'.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### EDMTut.r 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/edm-tutor)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

EDMTut.r is an app that teaches users about different genres of dance music. By far my favorite project so far. Details on concept, technology and next-steps are in the README.

As of 8pm, April 19th, feedback includes "Cool!", "What is moombahton?", "What's wrong with your HDMI port?", and "What's with that variable?".

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects included SWAPIbox (based on the Star Wars API), HeadCount (based on a Colorado School District API), and Movie Tracker.

#### SWAPIbox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/swapi)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

An app that displays informational cards about the Star Wars universe.

Students: Rebecca Holt, Julian Kyer

Instructor: Brenna Martenson

##### Specification Adherence 2
The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above. 
* Note: we received an extension and completed the missing feature, but I don't think this score was updated

##### Code Quality 3
Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design 3
Some changes requested by the evaluator

##### Testing 3
Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing. 21 tests, no fetch tests.

#### HeadCount
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ActionJonny/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

An app that displays school district data. This was our first project back, and it put us on the struggle bus.

Students: Jon Willemain, Julian Kyer

Instructor: Taylor Moore

##### Specification Adherence 2
The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

##### Code Quality 3
Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

##### Design 3
Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

##### Testing 3
Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### Movie Tracker
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/movie_tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Like NetFlix, without any of the features that make NetFlix worth $7/month.

Students: Mike Fenwick, Marissa Reinke, Julian Kyer

Instructor: Brenna Martenson

##### Specification Adherence 4
The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Redux Architecture 4
Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

##### Routing 4
Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### Javascript Style 3
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Testing 4
Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.

Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

##### Workflow 4
The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills
#### EDMTut.r 
My personal project is designed to share my love of EDM with people who aren't so familiar with the genre. I love being surrounded by happy people at a show, feeling music in my chest, and wanted to take a tiny slice of it to share with a new audience.

#### Flower Exercise

#### [Julian Kyer Turing Portfolio](https://www.turing.io/alumni/julian-kyer)

### Julian Kyer Module 4 Action Plan 

### Module 4 Goals
By the end of module 4, I would like to have a job offer, have a familiarity with back-end engineering, and be comfortable stepping into a junior developer position.

#### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
* Attend 4 meet-ups
* Post projects on GH pages
* Refine LinkedIn and resume
* Talk to Ingrid, Adam, Josh
* Make list of companies in area and research them
* Apply and start interviewing by second week of mod 4

##### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
In addition to regular projects, keep fundamentals sharp with Iron FE, polish the parts of past projects that I wasn't satisfied with.
##### Opportunities Research:
I will attend meet-ups, talk to friends in the industry, and research online as a "last-resort."
##### Cold Outreach/Network:
I've spoken to my mentor, who said it's better to start early. I also have a couple friends in the industry available as resources, listed above.

I should also talk to the people at the Corner Boxing Club who are participating in FounderFights with me for networking.
##### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
I think my personal brand has a compelling story, and will be helpful to pull on. Being a professional athlete for a decade communicates a lot of valuable things to an employer, as well as my work as an artist.
#### Timeline:
* Start attending meetups, build portfolio now
* Refactor and publish projects over intermission
* Reach out to contacts at end of mod3
* Iron FE and interview prep starting over intermission

##### Weekly Tasks:
* Commit to pairing with mod 2/3
* Job search Sundays, Wednesdays
* IronFE 2x week
* Saturday afternoon portfolio work
* Find meet-ups that don't conflict with sparring

#### What I Will Work on with Meg
Finding companies that would be a good fit, how to reach out, resume review.


### Gear Up

[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

I really enjoyed this session. I think automation is certainly something to be aware of, but I think there might be a little bit of 'Henny Penny, the sky is falling' going on. I enjoyed talking about the ethics of automation (for instance, self-driving cars are Trolley Car problems come to life), and I really enjoyed M4 facilitating.

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This was a repeat for us, which was disappointing, and my thoughts haven't really changed on the subject. But I really enjoyed hearing Jeff's perspective on grit... At the end of the session he asked if grit is bullshit, and my assessment is that grit is not bullshit, but our handling of the concept most certainly can be.

[Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I was ill for this Gear Up, but I'm familiar with the arguments and enjoyed discussing it with my cohort mates. I'm not sure I ever see that happening out of the goodness of humanity's heart, but I suppose it could wind up being an unintentional consequence of automation. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was happy being a resource for M2, and having them know they could reach out whenever they needed. Our cohort always got on well with each other, but it seemed especially so this module. It was a blast helping M1 students learn how to whiteboard, and I think we might have some fun coding-related projects planned over break to bring some humor into coding.

And of course, shameless plug... I'm reppin' Turing during Boulder Startup Week's Founder Fights (a charity boxing match) on May 19th. I was sick of some of the national discussions and attitudes going on, so I'm raising money for RAINN, the country's largest anti-sexual assault organization. Part of making a community feel safe is putting your money where your mouth is, or in my case, putting my mouth where fists are. It's my way of saying "I'm in your corner." 

### Feedback 
From Marissa Reinke: "Julian is so awesome to work with. It is easy to get overwhelmed in this program, but he always brings a lot of laughs to any project even when it’s not going well. A great problem solver as well. I think my only critique would be to start trusting in your abilities  - you are a very strong coder."

Feedback from Mike Fenwick: "While working with Julian during Movie Tracker I found his calm approach to programming to be very effective. If we were struggling with an issue Julian was able to research and find a solution to that problem and implement it quickly. I find this to be a very useful skill to have when programming.
Julian also has a great understanding of JS and is willing to get deeper knowledge of the things he is working on.
I look forward to working with Julian again."

To Mike Fenwick: "I really enjoy working with Mike. He is very inquisitive and willing to spend a lot of time figuring out the problem. I’ve also noticed that he will take breaks from his projects and cruise around, checking in on his cohort mates. He’s always willing to sit down with someone and help them tackle their problem, a generosity that doesn’t go unnoticed in 1611."
