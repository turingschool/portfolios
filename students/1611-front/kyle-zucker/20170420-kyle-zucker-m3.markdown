# Kyle Zucker - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My personal emphasis hasn't changed: learn, work with other developers and start building lasting relationships. And continue to code a lot.

## End of Module Assessment

### OOP TDD Eval
Evaluator: Taylor

Completed eval with a solid 10 seconds to spare.

## Work & Projects

Here are some tight things I've done this Mod

##### Complete Me

Evaluator: Brenna

Notes:

Tests: 24 Passing, 4 Skipped

Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes 5 iterations.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.
Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

Passed

#### SWAPIbox

Students: Kyle & Jon

Instructor: Taylor

Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

Design

3.5 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


##### Movie Tracker

Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Added movie trailers
Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


#### lunch-r

Self directed and of mod project. Technically it's not done yet. 


## Professional Skills


### Professional Development Workshops

I enjoyed Jeff's fireside chat with the Craftsy fellow. I found the discussion useful and got a lot of value out of seeing  thoughts on hiring more uplcose and personal

### Gear Up
#### Micro Aggression 

It's surprising the amount of thought I've been giving this topic. I appreciate that Turing doesn't push any particualr mentality too hard, as I feel my perspective on the topic is more nuanced than you'd expect. It's been interesting to mentally chew on the topic over time.  


## Feedback and Community Participation

### Feedback Recieved

Great pairing sessions, you didn't just give us the answers, you helped us better understand how to approach complex problems and turn them into step by step solutions.

Asking you a question occasionally felt like asking a monk atop a mountain about the meaning of life. Instead of heavily analyzing the question it might be better to quickly show how to lookup/research the problem so the person can internalize how to find the knowledge themselves.

Kyle was an amazing partner to work with. He is very intelligent and approaches problems in a unique manner. He is very easy to work with and always takes other team members ideas into consideration.

### Feedback Given 

Rebecca is the best. Our project would have not have been successful without her. Her devs skills helped the project go smoothly, and she's a blast to be around.
