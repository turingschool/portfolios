# Hugh Morrison - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I spent a tremendous amount of time and effort this mod perfecting my JS skills. I dove into node and express with fervor and excitement whilst attending IRON FE most mornings. I continued my involvement with the Wednesday AM meditation group and also spent a good deal of time pairing with those from other mods. Great time all around. What a fantastic mod.

## A: End of Module Assessment

* PASSING

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on a host of projects individually. Here, I will showcase my very cool projects.

### BYO-BACKEND

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/byo-backend)

* BYO backend was a spicy little number. I created my own shark related backend with super CRUD capabilities.
* This API was built using node/express/postgres/and knex.
* This was a super challenging project. Writing all the yung routes and creating an ultra robust testing suite was not only time consuming but also quite educational.  

### Carport Receptacles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/carport-receptacles)

Garage bin was a way over engineered idea box that was hiding behind an animated garage door. It put our skills to the test and was built using html/scss/jquery/express/node/knex/postgres.

#### Evaluation Scores

#### Specification Adherence
* 4: The application consists of one page with all of the major and minor functionality being provided. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. Application is in production and at least one extension is completed.
- Looks like there is a bug in the sorting in that it is case sensitive

#### Javascript Syntax & Style
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing
* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests and unit tests extensively across the entire application.

#### CSS Style
* 3.5:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### User Interface
* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The interface is aesthetically pleasing to the evaluator. There is good use color and whitespace. There is no point where the instructor cannot figure out how to use the application without guidance from the developer.

#### Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built some pretty cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase jet-fuel, and reactive sharks.

### jet-fuel

Jet fuel was a URL shortener and our intro to express.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

#### Instructor Evaluation Points (Robbie)

#### Specification Adherence

**45 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

**15 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Data Persistence with SQL Database

**20 points** - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

#### Testing

**12 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

**15 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

**15 points** - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

* Good, small commits but would like to see more conversation in the PR workflow - adding context to your PRs for the reviewer (in the description).

##### Final Score: 122 / 150

### Hue's Picker
I've always wanted a color palette generator and so we built one using electron.js.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/hues-picker)

#### feedback from Becca

 It only took four modules for us to finally work together! Working on the electron project with you and Pam was a great experience. Your vision and ability to work through problems is truly amazing. It's fascinating to see you work through a problem with such concentration and dedication. The only feedback I have for you is that when you're pair programming, sometimes you go too fast without speaking about to your choices and it can be hard to follow. You're a truly gifted developer and I can't wait to see where you end up in your career.

#### PASS.

### reactive sharks

Reactive sharks is simply a paradigm shifting app. Monumental disruption. We created a map that tracks sharks navigational activity over time. It is served up with a very pleasant UI and the UX is intuitive whilst being easy to approach.

We built a node/express/postgres backend and served up our UI using React and Redux. A phenomenal learning experience.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### PLAN YOUR OWN GEAR UP

* +* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1705-inning/group_six.md)

Planning our own gear up was revelatory. It was a delightful experience. To be able to give back to the broader community in such a way was fulfilling and empowering. We decided to touch on the subject of knowledge. We set out to explore, mostly in a group discussion format, the fleeting and illusory nature of knowledge.

We wanted to challenge our participants underlying assumptions and beliefs. We wanted to have a powerful and insightful discussion that would serve as a diving board for our discussion members to jump into the abyss of exploration and insight. We spoke on known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.

We then had a fantastic discussion regarding the value and relationships between these types of knowledge. Finally, we did our best to tie the discussion into programming. We touched on how the philosophical approach to inquiry and logic can help aspiring programmers. 10/10 would plan again.

### Playing a Part

This mod, I tried my absolute hardest to immerse myself in the Turing Community. I'm a bit sad to admit that I did not do as good of a job as I set out to. Although, I did continue my involvement with IRON FE and did continue to meet with the Wednesday morning meditators.

I helped lead a fantastic gear up that I hope will be passed down in the annals of gear up lesson plans and eventually help future Turing mods for years to come. What a fantastic mod. I look forward to swan diving into my job search with tenacity, resilience, grit, and agility the likes of which have never been seen before.
