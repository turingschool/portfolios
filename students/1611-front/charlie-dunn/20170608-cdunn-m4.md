#Charlie Dunn - M4 Portfolio

##Areas of Emphasis

My goal for mod4 was to round out my development knowledge and become proficient with Node/Express. I also wanted to learn more about APIs since they are such a big part of software development. Additionally, my goal was to go on at least one interview to begin that process and get a little more comfortable marketing myself as a developer.

##D: Professional Skills

####Gear Up Reflection - Universal Basic Income

I'll admit that at first I wasn't thrilled with the idea of creating and leading a gear up session. I was already feeling pretty overwhelmed by mod4 and I found it difficult to give this a lot of attention. That being said, the planning process actually went very smoothly and it was great getting to know new people from mod4 backend that I probably wouldn't have gotten to know otherwise.

When it came time to lead the session I was a little nervous that people weren't going to be engaged and we would be scrambling to fill extra time. As it turned out, engagement was awesome and we actually ran out of time and had to cut the conversation short. I was really impressed and happy to see people take it seriously and it seemed as though people found some value in the session. Overall it turned out to be a great experience.
