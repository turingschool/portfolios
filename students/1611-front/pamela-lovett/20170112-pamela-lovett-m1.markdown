# Pamela Lovett - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, my goal was to establish a strong foundational knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I came into the program having done just a small amount of coursework on sites like CodeAcademy. I completed all of the pre-work and also read Eloquent JavaScript in its entirety. Despite this, I still felt like there was much that I could do in terms of approving my understanding of all three things listed above.

#### Comprehensive Quizlette

Passing score

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed working on an individual project to the start the module because it gave me a good idea of where I was in terms of learning. It also helped to have to do everything on my own.

Individual Projects:
* Mythical Creatures
* [Penguin Party](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/penguin-party)
* [Static Comp 1](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/static-comp)
* [Static Comp 2](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/pl-comp-challenge-2)
* Static Comp 3

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#####Description: A game that allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

#####UX/UI Expectations
3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

#####Functional Expectations
2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

#####Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#####Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#####Fundamental JavaScript
2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication


## C: Group Work & Projects

Initially, working in pairings turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated. Despite having a pretty solid DTR in place, I think it was difficult for both my partner and I to really grasp and implement what pairing entails. Now that I've done three group projects and seen some of the struggles that can (and do) come up in pairings, I feel very comfortable working in pairs. I love being able to learn and grow with another person by my side!

Work Projects:
I completed 3 group projects in a group this module:
* Linked List
* Idea Box
* Game Time

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#####Description: An application that allows the user to generate bookmarks on a webpage.

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes:
Well done, need to work on locking in details like indentation consistently. Had a slight lack of balance between both Pam and Becca sharing the JS and CSS writing. Used jQuery and Flexbox, which required some end-of-project refactoring to include. Good job taking risks!

#####Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

#####Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

#####Workflow
3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#####HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#####CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Idea Box

#####Description: An application that allows the user to both record, store, and retrieve data/information.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:
Filter was not working, but implementation was close (jQuery each)
Good conversation in GitHub, but more of it, especially in the PR descriptions
Good JS - continue refactoring and breaking out logic into smaller, more readable functions

#####Specification Adherence
2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above..

#####HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#####CSS Style
2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

#####JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#####Collaboration
3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

###Game-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stacimcwilliams/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

#####Description: Breakout is a game where the player uses a rectangle-shaped paddle to hit a block-shaped ball and destroy rectangle-shaped tiles at the top of the screen. The goal is to destroy all the tiles without allowing the ball to fall through the bottom of the canvas. As you level up, the ball moves faster.

Evaluator: Louisa

######Functional Expectations
4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
User Interface

#####User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

#####Testing
They will be adding some tests, to be completed by end of week to be bumped up to a 3.
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

#####JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#####Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

I looked forward to setting up a DTR in each of my pairings in order to better understand my partner's pairing goals and strengths and witnesses. It served as a good ice-breaker for working together.

###Gear Up Reflections

[Introversion/Extroversion](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I really enjoyed this session. It was nice to interact in groups with a mix up of "introverted" and "extroverted" people and here everyone's perspectives.

[Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

Feedback is such an important part of becoming a better programmer, pairing partner, and human being. I found talking about different strategies to be extremely beneficial.

[Growth Mindset](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

The Gear Up on growth mindset vs fixed mindset was one of my favorite sessions. I found (and taught a lesson) about Carol Dweck's research nearly ten years ago when I taught for a semester as a 7th grade Language Arts teacher. It was great to be able to circle back to her research now in order to remind myself that having a growth mindset will play a HUGE factor in my success here at Turing at beyond.

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

It was great to break out into groups to discuss grit. The timing for this gear up was excellent, considering where we were in the module. Grit requires one to have both perseverance and passion.... and is tightly intertwined with having a growth mindset.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding

I really liked the support that was given for building up our resumes and linkedIn profiles. I also really enjoyed being able to take (and talk about) the strengths finder test with Allison and others in the cohort.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####to Staci 1611FE (Game Time)

I have worked with Staci on a number of occasions during class, and I am currently working with her on our final project for Mod1. Staci is extremely respectful and empathetic in her interactions with both myself and others in our cohort. She makes a very conscious effort to monitor her learning and adjust her study habits/workload due to her desire to have a deeper understanding of the material we are covering, which I believe is rare in others. Her love of learning goes past wanting to get "perfect" scores from a rubric, which I find very admirable. She has truly been a pleasure to work with throughout the course.

At times, I think that Staci can be too hard on herself.  We have discussed this a number of times, as I feel we both are similar in this way. She understands a lot more than she thinks, and she has mentioned that her self-doubt has caused her to not "speak up" during a few occasions in class or in pairings. I think this is a shame - as our cohort could definitely benefit from her thoughts and suggestions!

####to Rebecca 1611FE (Linked List)

One of Rebecca's greatest strengths is her determination to do well and finish strong. She has a can-do attitude and is not afraid to reach out to others for help or clarification on things. She puts a great amount of effort into doing her very best at all times and does well with showing confidence in the decisions that she makes.

At times, I believe Rebecca's determination to do her very best personal work can sometimes overshadow the team dynamic. During both our pairings in-person and remotely, I believe this played a role in our struggle to find common ground to work together on tasks as team members.

####to Sam 1610 FE (Pairing)

Sam is knowledgeable, patient, and flexible. While mentoring, he is great about asking questions to make sure that the people he is helping are actually grasping the material at hand. He is willing to take the time to help guide others to the "answer" without just handing it over - which is no small task!

####to Franklin 1611 FE (Pairing)

Franklin is a very approachable person who is very eager to help and talk things through with others. Although we have talked quite extensively in class concerning lessons and in-class work items,  Franklin and I have yet to pair on an actual project. From what I've seen, he does a great job of going above and beyond the expectations of the project requirements.

I think Franklin's greatest strengths are his cheery nature, his passion for his work, and his willingness to help others. I wish I could offer something in the way of constructive criticism for Franklin, but I don't feel like any feedback I'd give would be as valuable as the feedback I can provide after having done a project with him.

####to Krystin 1611FE (Idea Box)

Krystin has a high level of self-awareness, which I find is not typical for many people. She is open and honest with herself and others about her biggest strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will serve her well during her time at Turing and beyond. Even though each of my project pairings have been successful in helping me grow in different ways, I can honestly say that my pairing with Krystin made the most difference in how I approach my work now. While discussing and "defining" our relationship for our paired project, I made it clear to Krystin how uncomfortable I have been with "driving" and "breaking" code on the fly... and how I thought this might be stunting my development. During our entire pairing Krystin not only honored my desire to take the extra time to really understand how our code was working, but she also forced me to drive more than I would have otherwise and constantly encouraged me to "break" my code.

I believe Krystin could benefit from taking more short breaks while working on projects. She is pretty good at doing this currently, but can sometimes get very involved and forget to giver herself some room to breathe.

### Being a Community Member

####from Staci 1611FE (Game Time)

I have paired with Pam numerous time in classes and also on our final Mod-1 project Game Time. Pam is very quick to ask questions to clarify if she doesn't understand something and never hesitates to reach out when something is unclear. I think both of us were nervous coming into the project but Pam was very supportive of working as team and of my learning goals. She is also very proactive in acknowledging and working toward her own learning goals. I always enjoy pairing with Pam and she is very encouraging and positive. While sometimes she gets frustrated(like all of us), she is quick to implement a few plan and start tackling it. I was impressed by some of the solutions she came up with for our project. I think the next step for her would be to have confidence in her abilities.

####from Rebecca 1611FE (Linked-List)

You are a respectful person to work with. You are committed to understanding every line of code and how it all interacts together to function. In evaluation, you made a comment that you often doubt yourself and let that become apparent to the people around her. You should give yourself more credit because you know a lot more than you think you do. I have noticed you have been staying later after class to work on the more recent projects which will benefit you. I wish we could have had more time to work together in-person after class and over the weekend on our project than we did - I think that would have made our pairing more successful than it was. Overall, great work!

####from Krystin 1611FE (Idea Box)

You are determined, dedicated, you have a ton of grit, AND seemingly limitless energy. You came in early, stayed late, weekends - even when feeling under the weather. During our project, we put in a LOT of hours - many of which were spent scratching our heads! Our collective ability to never flip out in frustration was pretty impressive - we kept the overall tone light and humorous. I enjoyed the time we spent working together a lot, no matter how much we wanted to pull out our hair.

You can be more direct with others, especially when you want to test an idea don't hesitate to go rogue and test out a bunch of things. Version control shall set us free.

####from Kyle 1611FE

Pam is great! I really love her ability to take the lead and start up class discussions.

###Playing a Part

Currently, I am an active member in the JC Society and parenting slack channels. Although I have only attended one coffee Tuesday for JC Society, my goal for next module is to attend at least 3 of the 6 that are set to occur during the six weeks. This module I also attended lunch roulette as went to posse meetups for Verou and Pahlka. I have joined the Armstrong Posse but have yet to attend a formal meeting due to spikes for Armstrong being cancelled.

I make an effort to reach out to those in my cohort by striking up conversation in and out of class that is related to class discussions as well as more informal things. I also use Slack as a way to stay connected to others in the cohort.

I have made it a point to attend every Friday speaker (with just one exception.) I have managed to connect with a number of people from the BE program from these events as well as other mixers/special events that Turing has put together.
