## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My personal project was a real challenge for me. I was able to plow through many obstacles on my own but found out that I need to build a lille more robust support network. overall I feel that I learned the most that I have ever learned on a project but I was also more frustrated than ever before.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

Lots of group practice this session. I feel like I fell into a groove towards the end learning how to divide the work and pair program. It was also very illuminating to go from all the group projects to the solo project and realize what a help it is to have a partner.  

### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/headcount2.0.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0.git)

Description: HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a DistrictRepository class. After you finish iteration 1 you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the create-react-app boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through the documentation, and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.

#### Students: Franklin & Rebecca
#### Evaluator: Brenna
#### Notes:

- Tests: 35 Total Tests   

#### Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

####Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### CSS/Design
- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing
- 3.5 - Combo of both.

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/movie-tracker.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker.git)

Description:
This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

Bc this is still in beta here is what you'll need to know.

Using PostgreSQL
Setting up steps:
npm install
createdb - if you don't have postgresSQl go install it here: http://postgresapp.com/
psql -f ./src/sql/users.sql
npm start - visit /api/users - should see a json response.
2 APIs - MovieDB and your very own api
Fetch upcoming movies from MovieDB

**MOVIE SPEC**:

```
Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
```

##### Specification Adherence  

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

##### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

##### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### SWAPI-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/swapi-box.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Description:For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.


Students: Pam, Franklin

Instructor: Brenna

Tests: 26 Passing Tests

##### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

##### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design
3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## D: Professional Skills

We had some great discussions on mico-agressions and automation. I feel that these are issues that we will continue to encounter in our professional life.

### Gear Up
#### Micro-agressions

* [link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

A Month Of Micro-aggressions:
* I can see how one comment itself can seen innocuous however when strung together the collective bunch can take a tole. It also seems that a few of these circumstances are misguided attempts to connect. When you are on the look out for what is bad you may miss the intention of the act. Some of the others are blatantly aggressive and mean spirited. 

Stop Acting So Surprised: How Micro-aggressions Enforce Stereotypes in Tech:
* it is plain to see that the expectation of what a tech person should be can be stifling for the industry. It is important to be open to different archetypes within the field. 

notes on the session:
* It is such a fine line between a micro aggression and a overbearing personality. I feel that the key to this issue is to determine the original intention. If you are always on the look out for how people are looking to put you down that is all you will end up seeing. That being said it is the obligation of those in your community to see when you are being unjustly judged or maligned. 


#### Automation and Bots

* [link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

* [Humans need not apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

* [Pbs news hour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/labor-saving-robots-spell-doom-american-workers/)


The first thing that comes to mind is Star-Trek which has moved to a utopian society where art and culture rule. In the absence of a service based economy what will people do with their time and how will we value time. I see a fork in the road in the not to distant future where either humanity or capitalism will win out. In the case of capitalism, we face a future not too unlike the dystopian novels that are so popular today. Wealth will continue to gather at the top and the rest of us who are unlucky enough to not be related to the industry will flounder at the bottom. This will likely result in a large-scale revolt. Who is to say how this would play out but the foreshadow of how it may be waged is evident in the terror attacks of today.

On the other hand society could double down on humanity and reinvent our current value system. When your value is no longer tied to productivity, how do we define our daily lives?

To what degree do we control the shape of automation?
What should and shouldn’t be automated?
What is my reasonability?

Notes from SLACK
Automation is in motion.  What degree can we control it?
Can machines provide for humans in ways humans can only provide for other humans?
Economic impacts of automation?
Define what we should or shouldn’t automate?
Will automation remove the sense of purpose that we possess?
Will automation free humans for other worthwhile activities?
How to address this issue with our own community?
How will intrinsic human desires, like are desire to learn and understand, or greed, look as we increasingly become more reliant on automation?

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Staci
* Strengths:
  * Organized
    * Staci consistently kept us on track and moving forward.
  * Persistent
    * Staci would often work through frustrating moments until we were able to get things sorted out.
  * Positive
    * Staci is a constant source of encouragement and positivity. She helps keep the group sane and chipper.
* Growth:
  * Confidence
    * Staci knows a ton and if she doesn’t she knows how to find it. At times, I could feel that she was doubting herself when she already had the answer. She should trust her intuition and allow space for mistakes.

Staci is a joy to work with and consistently kept us positive and motivated. I look forward to working with her again soon.


#### Kenia
* I love working with Kenia. She is positive and motivated. I always feel heard and hope she feels the same.
I look forward to working with her again soon.
* Growth:
I think we could have worked together a little more on our last project however the nature of the work was easier to complete separately.

#### Rebecca
* It was fantastic working with you. I feel like our pacing was great and we played off each other very well.
* Growth:
I cant think of anything at the moment. I think we made a great team.

I look forward to working with you again.
