## A: End of Module Assessment

We will see


## B: Individual Work & Projects

###### Endpoints

40 points: Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints but did not secure 4 of them with JWTs or have a custom endpoint based on query params.

Error handling is a bit off/pretty weak with some of the endpoints. No JWTs.

###### Data Persistence with SQL Database

40 points: The application contains at least 2 tables with a proper relationship between data sources.

###### Testing and Linting

30 points: Project has a running test suite that covers all happy and sad paths for the appropriate endpoints. The project has a linting configuration that passes with no errors.

###### JavaScript Style

10 points: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### JetFuel

###### Specification Adherence

45 points: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###### User Interface

15 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

###### Data Persistence with SQL Database

20 points - The application persists data in a SQL database with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

###### Testing

10 points - Project has server-side happy tests but no sad path tests. Since the server is only handling errors with console.logs, I understand it would've been difficult to implement these. This is something I would definitely go back and try to complete as it will be good practice for future projects this module.

###### JavaScript Style

15 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

15 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## D: Professional Skills

I guess it is a knock on most individuals that come out of boot camps, but I feel I need to work on my problem solving abilities. They improved a lot, but they are not where I want them to be

### Gear Up

This mod we actually lead our own gear up, we did "Black Mirror" what would you do for likes. I have to admit, it was fun seeing the individuals discussion. The concept was how would you treat someone if you knex they only had 10 facebook friends compared to someone that had 1000? Not only that, but what kind of car you can rent is based on this ranking, what kind of health care you recieve is based on this, pretty crazy stuff, but not sure how likes in the show is any different than how much money someone makes in our society.


### Professional Development Workshops

Submitted deliverables on the Turing website and to Meg


### Playing a Part

Just led a gear up this mod, we were pretty busy, so didn't have an opportunity to run my own spike or help lower mods like I did in the past.
