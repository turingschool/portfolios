# Jonathon Willemain - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Last mod we only did one project in React, so I really wanted to work on my React skills.

Last mod I wanted to improve on coding in-front of people, I still need work with that, but I feel a lot more comfortable throwing my ideas out to the group.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

headcount 2.0
movie-tracker
star-wars-api

#### headcount2.0

* https://github.com/ActionJonny/headcount
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0

Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
CSS/Design

2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.
Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### movie-tracker

https://github.com/ActionJonny/movie-tracker
https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker

MOVIE SPEC:

Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.

Specification Adherence

3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### star-wars-api

https://github.com/ActionJonny/swapi-box
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html

Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

Design

3.5 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


## D: Professional Skills

I guess it is a knock on most individuals that come out of boot camps, but I feel I need to work on my problem solving abilities. They improved a lot, but they are not where I want them to be

### Gear Up
#### Grit

I know our mod has done the grit gear up before, but I thought doing it again - when we are almost done - was very useful. Most gear-ups only give you one side and expect you to form an opinion based on that one side, but I have always thought you cannot form an opinion based on one sides perspective. Being almost done I felt like I was looking more at life after Turing, and not really focusing on what still needs to be done. You always hear keep your eye on the prize, but with all this talk about finding a job I kinda lost sight on what the prize actually is, and that is learning as much as possible while at Turing.


### Professional Development Workshops

Submitted deliverables on the Turing website

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

To me:

Daniel Bucket
Jon has maintained an approachable persona. He has always been been willing to pull away if only for a few minutes to see if he can at least help guide me in right direction on whatever it was I was working on. On a few occasions he even sought me out to see how I was during on my project. I found that his willingness, genuine concern, effort was key to my success as a student. It literally enabled me to be successful at a mod level. I’d recommend him for a special award if I could.

Rebecca Holt
Jon was enjoyable to work with. He is open and honest with his ideas and welcomes other's. He isn't afraid to delete everything and start over to make sure he understands the concepts. I look forward to working with him in the future

Dylan Avery
Will it snow?
Will it rain?
Will we pleasure?
Will we pain?
Will we treble?
Will we gain?
A friend like Jon, Willemain?

Franklin Crosby
Strengths:
     - Positive: Jon keeps a smile on his face and always makes a point to keep the mood light
     - Honest: I always feel that Jon speaks his mind and lets you know when things are working or not
     - Persistent: Jon stuck with issues we were having until we were able to figure them out. This served us very well
Growth:
     - Focus: Jon at times can get sidetracked. I think sticking to 25min work periods would help with this.

Jon was a great team member and always kept me smiling and moving forward. I look forward to working with him again.

From me:

I have always sought Franklin for help, and finally had an opportunity to work on a project with him. I like how he is able to break a problem down and make sure everyone understood what he was thinking and then look to the group to see what we thought on a solution. I feel like a better programmer after working with him. I honestly don't have a critique for him, he is a great person to be around and work with.

Staci is an amazing individual to work with, I had an opportunity to do a group project with her and Franklin. There was a time where we felt like we were not as far as some of the other groups, and Staci didn't mind going at a slower pace to make sure all of us understood the material. Outside of that project she has always been there for me and she has been a huge part of my success at Turing. You are very intelligent and know the material, my only knock is that you need to be more confident. You bring great ideas to the group and everyone improves when you share them. Staci and I are going to be friends long after we are done at Turing.

### Playing a Part

I think I have done a very good job being a part of the Turing community this past mod, I love helping the lower mods when they need help, Tim and I even ran a spike. I also helped someone with the data tries project, which I was telling myself I would not do. I feel like I can still do more by going to meet-ups and representing Turing and minorities in the Denver devs community.
