BYOB was our first opportunity to go on our own and create a backend using Node.js. I selected data from an API that had quiz questions and made multiple quizzes that each had their own set of questions.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### JetFuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marissa27/jet-fuel-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)
* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1611/mod-4/jet-fuel/Marissa-Becca.md)

JetFuel was our first project of the mod that we got to do with a partner. We had to allow a user to store URLs and get a shortened version of that URL to utilize. They also had folders they could organize and store them in.

* Feedback from Becca:
Marissa was an amazing group partner. Her eye for design and bringing it to life is incredible. You have a gift! It only took 4 mods for us to work together but it was worth the wait. You helped pull me out of rabbit holes before I even knew I was stuck. The only feedback I have is that you're an amazing developer but sometimes you hold yourself back from your full potential. Don't be afraid to go outside the box and stretch those js muscles. I can't wait to see what the future holds for you! #fastfriendsforlife

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### "Black Mirror: What would you do for likes?"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1705-inning/group_five.md)

Planning a gear-up all mod was surprisingly fun. It was fun taking all that we had learned and then apply it to something to pass on to people in the mods below. It was even better seeing how well our gear-up took and that no one opened a phone or computer once and everyone was very involved in the discussion.

## E: Community Participation
* Spoke on a Try Turing Panel
* Led two Iron FEs
* Paired with mod3
* Spoke to Mod1FE

### Playing a Part
* Going to MeetUps
* Applying to jobs
