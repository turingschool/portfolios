# Marissa - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I set out to continue to get more confident and proficient in fundamental JavaScript. I also wanted to push more of the ux/ui side of things.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Self-Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marissa27/trailhead)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

TrailHead is based off the dating apps that are quite popular right now, but instead of trying to find some random hookup or date it is for the hiker in all of us - at least the trendy part. It let's you look through a series of photos of hikes in Colorado (top 11 from alltrails) and you can swipe yes or no if you want to do that hike based solely off a photo, length, if dog friendly, and difficulty level.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/headcount2.0/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.
You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

###### Specification Adherence
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

###### Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

###### CSS/Design
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

###### Testing
- 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

Feedback from Staci

Marissa and I partnered on the first project of the mod. She was a great person to partner with. She is great at problem solving and is always open to trying different ways to solve a problem. She's also really good at referencing the docs or old projects to help find a solution. She was flexible and great at collaborating and working through problems. We partnered well together and I always felt like she had my back! She can get a little frustrated with herself like us all but she is good about walking away to refresh and always makes sure I do to. Can't wait to work together again!

#### SWAPIbox
* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/swapi-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

Instructor: Brenna
Testing: 21 Tests


###### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

###### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

###### Design

4 - Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

###### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

Feedback from Charlie:

Marissa is a pleasure to work with. She has a great sense of humor and keeps things light even when we hit road blocks and weren't making much progress. She is a very talented designer and it was a lot of fun working off her comps to create the UI for our app.

#### Ultimate UX/UI
* [GitHub URL for our Design](https://github.com/marissa27/fitness-app)
* [GitHub URL for static comp of other teams design](https://marissa27.github.io/Fitness-App-Comp/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ultimate-ux-ui-team-challenge.html)

This is a 3-week project broken into three phases. You will be asked to work through the life cycle of a project brief: design, build, and client review/critique.

#### Movie-Tracker
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ultimate-ux-ui-team-challenge.html)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!


###### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

###### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.
* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 1: There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

###### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


Feedback from Julian:

 I always enjoy working with you, you obviously have a great eye for design, and I like how focused you are on UI/UX. I think we both got a little steam-rolled by Fenwick, not because he’s a jerk but because he is so type-A. But you caught up and came up with a sweet app. You should name it Timber.

From Fenwick:

#### remEMBER
* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/1611-remember-splinter/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

Create a notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality.

Developers will not have commit rights to the master branch. All changes must be made through pull requests that will be reviewed by instructors and merged into master when approved.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Julian:
Julian is so awesome to work with. It is easy to get overwhelmed in this program, but he always brings a lot of laughs to any project even when it’s not going well. A great problem solver as well. I think my only critique would be to start trusting in your abilities  - you are a very strong coder.

To Staci:

To Charlie: Charlie was an incredible partner. He is so talented and very humble about his skillset. I felt like we worked well together and did a lot of switching off who was driving and going through the logic of what we needed to do before just codiing to code. His CSS wizardy makes me very jealous!

To Fenwick: Working with Fenwick is awesome. He is good at going over anything he did outside of the group working together and was also letting Julian and myself drive. He is extremely humble and an amazing coder. Should probably sleep more though.

To Tim: Tim was awesome to work with. He is extremely good at coding and fun to work with. My only critique would be to breathe a little and don’t stress yourself into an early grave.


### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Beth Knight (Mod2-BE)

Marissa helped with my shopping cart CSS/HTML. She's a design ninja and now our site looks really professional. As a backend non designer, she made it really easy to understand what she was doing. Her twitter game is also on point.

### Playing a Part

Did a spike session with Tim on hacking Oauth.

### Gear Up

Microaggressions - It was really interesting hearing everyones views on this topic, especially with the scenarios. 

AI - This was really interesting,  but also terrifying. Fingers crossed I won't be out of a job in ten years.

Grit - It wasn't horrible having a total recap of grit, especially halfway through mod3!

MOD4 AI - Although the info didn't feel that different from the other AI gearup it was really awesome having other students lead it.
