Areas of Emphasis

At the beggining of this module I thought I needed improvement on my ruby skills and my communication. I did a lot of after school studying on the fundamentals of ruby and now feel fairly strong with it. Every time I was paired I set out to improve my communication. Before it was difficult for me to approach most people, but now I feel that I can communicate my thoughts much more easily.

End of Module Assessment

* Good start with setup
* Try not to think too far ahead
* You get the syntax but it just feels like you need to write MORE CODE
* Please get into Exercism and similar small problems
* Need to push to the breaking point

Work

This module I worked on these projects:

Robodoku

https://github.com/Unsafepond/Robodoku
https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown
We'll build a program that can solve an valid Sudoku puzzle.

-"uses a random insertion technique"
-"no objects pulled out of solver"

Linked List

-https://github.com/Unsafepond/Linked-list
-https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown
-Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

-"30 tests, all pass"
-"Tests are trending to a good place, need a bit more with the edge 
cases and some are hard to follow"
-"Implementation has some good code reuse, other spots where it's missing"
-"Missed some features because JC was slow in pushing the spec changes"

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 2
Encapsulation: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Looping / Recursion: 3

Projects

This module I worked on these pair projects:

Enigma	

https://github.com/Unsafepond/Enigma-new
Original Assignment
-In this project youâ€™ll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

-"No cracking"
-"Like the "function objects" ie decryptor"
-"The binary was nice"
-"When something is difficult to test, identify what is making it difficult and push that higher in the callstack "
