HTML
Nice work!

CSS
Consider using multiple classes where you have a more broad class for shared styles: ie. card-button
Love those organizational comments (maybe need less)
Organize within rules as you go

JS
Good naming for the most part, but always think about having the element type in the name if it is an element
Look at the style guides!

dont forget that meta tag!

Try using debugger more often to test things out
if you can pass an object as an argument, do so - instead of passing properties individually
