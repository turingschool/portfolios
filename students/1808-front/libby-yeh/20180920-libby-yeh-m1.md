# Libby Yeh - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Mod1 was to create a strong foundation inclusive of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. I wanted to ensure that all of the concepts were "clicking" and I felt confident navigating my computer, the terminal, the DOM and with the application of concepts. Additionally, I wanted to establish strong relationships with my cohort, upper-modules and mentors.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment ** 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects ** 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects ** 3
* **D: Professional Skills ** 3
* **E: Community Participation ** 3.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Overall, I gave myself a 3 out of 4 for Mod1. I believe my progress shows a consistant upward trajectory. I have set a very solid programming foundation that I will be able to continue to build off of. I think the last week really allowed for increased understanding and application of concepts, specifically around DOM manipulation and test-driven development. From this initial 6-week experience, I have also learned a great deal about my learning style and needs for this program. I put in a lot of reps to really commit technical vocabulary, syntax, order of operation, and manipulation techniques to memory. However, this last week and a half taught me to slow down, assess one problem (error, test, etc) at a time, instead of trying to digest and figure everything out at once, which is generally not successful. In regards to my learning style, I identified that I need to request and schedule help for specific or larger issues that arise, rather than relying on gaining help ad hoc. I found that often that kind of help yeilded additional frustration but scheduled help via pairing or through one of my mentors yeilded greater understanding, clarification in a shorter amount of time, i.e. efficiency! Finally, I have identified that I need to be even more efficient in my study habits. I spent a great deal of time doing reps and making sure that I was prepared for the DOM test, mythical creatures test and final static comp. Therefore, my array prototype understanding does not feel as fluid (meaning easy application of syntax and methods) as I want it to be. I have already put a plan together to work on this over the break to be prepared for Mod2. I think I need to make sure to utilize POMs, timed and planned study schedules in order to ensure I have a chance be awesome at all the things! 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My Score:
3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

I was extremely commited to delivering the best individual projects that I could. I would give myself a 4 for effort on all of the them and im very happy with the progress that was made throughout the module. I see consistant growth from my initial project to final paired project and through all 3 of my static comps.

#### Number Guesser

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. Completed through Phase 3.

Evaluation Comments:

* Great comp design, a few user experiences that could be improved on
* Make sure buttons change color when they are enabled
* Keep experimenting with how to make the min and max numbers show up
* Great work on HTML and organization
* Good experimentation with input range
* Experiment adding function on input ranges using event listeners rather than adding them to the HTML
* Use sections instead of divs
* Instead of having multiple forms for each input, try putting multiple inputs in one form when the inputs are similar
* Good use of grouping styles
* Try alphabetizing properties next time
* Use text-align only on text tags (p, h1, etc.)
* When you have multiple classes that are doing the same thing, try using only one class
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and functions

#### Static Comp-1

* https://github.com/libbyeh/ly-comp-challenge-1
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

Chicken Profile - incorporating images, blocks with various colors, picking appropriate color schemes and utilizing basic but good design concepts.

Loved the chickens. Watch margins, text size and how text/images look when responsive. Also, watchout for issues when using pictures on hovers.

#### Static Comp-2

* https://github.com/libbyeh/ly-comp-challenge-2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

2Win Website - getting more technical and detailed. 

Received good feedback, continue to watch margin and overall height/width issues for responsive layouts (in media queries).

#### Static Comp-3

* https://github.com/libbyeh/ly-comp-challenge-3
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

Job Profile - incredibly detailed, with lots of different types of elements to implement.

Feedback was very positive, could tell that a lot of effort was put in. Needs some polish and tweaking and cleaning up of the CSS. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

My Score:
3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

I am pleased with my perfomance in group projects and received positive feedback as well as coaching that will help with next module. Overall, I stayed very positive, followed our DTR and completed each project to or all the way through Phase 3. Most partnerships brought complimentary strengths and as the projects went on, I felt more confident in my javascript skills and understanding. I do feel like I drove a lot of the first project and that gave me confidence initially.

#### Linked Lists

* https://github.com/LittleD1808/Linked-List
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Application that takes two inputs and creates new bookmarks in a specific section.

Evaluation comments:

* Creating more commits and branches each time you are implementing a new feature
* Being consistent in design and keeping the design flat (specifically talking about the counter)
* For mobile view, might want to make the inputs and buttons a bit smaller so it fits better for a phone
* Nice clean structure with your HTML
* Maybe add some roles on to your sections and some aria labels to your forms, inputs, buttons, etc.
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing CSS styles
* Places where you are using positioning relative, see if you can control that without having to change the positioning (maybe flex?);
* Find places where you can use short hand for style properties (like the shortcut for margin)
* Keep working on refactoring styles
* Nice work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Good consistency with using named functions on your event listeners
* Don't really need the Array.from since document.querySelectorAll already returns you an array
* For your next project, try using event delegation instead of having to manually add event listeners
* Experiment using parentNode in order to move up the DOM tree to add that class of "read" to a bookmark

* https://github.com/b3an5/idea-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Application for recording and archiving ideas (good and bad alike).

Evaluation Comments:

HTML 
* dont forget that meta tag!
CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments
* always indent within media queries
* consider utilizing min-width for containers
JS
* love that you're using the data-id attr
* Consider using arrays and leveraging indices to display text ie. qualities
* Try using debugger more often to test things out
* if you can pass an object as an argument, do so - instead of passing properties individually

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My Score:
3.5: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond supports of the community.

I think I provided meaningful impact to the Turing community by consistently attending Turing events, speakers, wrap-ups, and demos. I was also recognized by my peers for my positive additude which I think is really important to maintain while at Turing. I continued to build upon the mentor-student "way-of-life" by meeting with 2-3 of my mentors on a weekly basis. And I jumped right in to pairing with people in Mod2 and Mod3. I am also volunteering next week during Denver Start-Up Week to continue to build out the Turing and my own community.

Profession Development - My Score:
3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

Completed all PD deliverables and dedicated to building out my story and presence in the Turing and Tech community.
