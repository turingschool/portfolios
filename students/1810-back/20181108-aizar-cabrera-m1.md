# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to accomplish more learning, I feel very confident with the basis I was able to build during this second round. I was able to reinforce and learn a lot of the basic concepts that the first time did not get. I think where I was more successful was in the learning how objects can be used to communicate with each other.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Hashes, specifically iterating over hashes, I am aware that I should keep working on it. Because they'll get more complicated. And I've learned a lot too, through repeated failure. I feel way more comfortable now, but I know I should keep working on them.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite was Black Thursday, because I was able to learn a lot about managing people, we had so many fights, over the first 2-3 days we wasted A LOT of time solving personal issues, and in the  end I used a tactic to force my team to work as one, and we did the best we could, and we were able to finish JUST in time.
The least favorite, I think it would be Sorting Cards, Why...? Because did not count towards our promotion.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
That I've learned a lot. That I need to respect the amount of time that is provided for me. I also learned a lot about design, the fact that I should take my time designing the proper structure of the classes and methods I'm gonna need for my program.
One of the things that excited me the most was the fact of having full understanding of "Object Oriented Programming" and it's principles.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Oh man, I've learned so many things, time management, people management, communication with the team, workflow. Learned a lot about working with other people and respect their point of views. The fact that not always the things need to be done my way. But also, that since we were a team, I could not let my partner to crash and burn because of not wanting to learn some new techniques. Specially because those techniques would be implemented for the rest of the program ("TDD").
Also learned that code is incredibly cheap, we hit a point in a project where we couldn't integrate the code written and we asked for advice and we were told to start all over again, and so we did, and we were able to finish our assignment in 3 days roughly worked but it was the best experience ever. I think we both learned a bunch from that project.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I did A LOT of volunteer work for Turing. I was also TA several times for Try Coding. And I was able to learning a lot by helping people, there were sometimes, where I've decided to sacrifice my time-project in order to help others to learn a concept. And that would help me to get a deeper understanding of things.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
If I make it, keep doing volunteering work and trying to help others, as much as I can.
