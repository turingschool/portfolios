## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal in repeating this Module was to learn the skill of creating code
that is readable and cohesively does what I want it to do. I also was looking
forward to developing a solid foundation and a style to build on as a career
comes into question. Learning to code using TDD was one of the pertinent keys I
needed to begin understanding the scope of what we're working through in code.
The teaching style was very different from the first time around this mod and I
think it works well with students who have a bit more of a foundation, thankfully
of which I did have this time.

My main area of opportunity would be in having more confidence in my learned
skill when taking paired assessments. My nerves often got the best of me at times
even when I had the solution to certain problems in my tool belt. I do know that
this will be how interviews in the future will be conducted and I only imagine
continuing to be thrown in the fire, as is this school's motto, will allow for
more practice in this vain.

## Projects

My favorite project in this mod was being reassured by Sal in the very first
project 'Sorting Cards', that I am supposed to be here at Turing. The paired
projects went well I believe and I did learn a lot from each part from each
individual in our cohort.

I also enjoyed taking a little bit of time off in stress to work on the lightning
talk. This broke up the pace a bit and allowed for a slight focus on working
through a less technical project in the middle of thee Black Thursday. I was
proud of the projects I've worked on with my daughter and her youtube channel,
it was nice to revisit those in the middle of this hard work.

My least favorite project might have been Black Thursday again only because it's
such a huge project and has a lot a very fine details to work with. Usually
I love to nit-pick other aspects of my life but given the time frame and my
teams working style (which was still great by the way), it didn't leave much
time to refactor and present a well oiled machine, and a completion of iteration
4 . It is a very hard project and it's good to know that it can be completed
even though we were right at the cusp.

## Community

I honestly believe that I learned a lot from meeting certain students and work-
ing through issues that I didn't know I even had myself. I made a commitment
to pair with Zach, who was a phenomenal resource, and used that knowledge then
to help others when needed. I made myself available when I didn't have the kids
to take care of but I honestly learned a lot from others this Mod just talking
through different ways of approaching issues.

Next mod I'd like to continue to contribute to this cohort by linking us together
with members of 1808 who've gone through what we will embark on. I definitely
know now, more than ever, that we need each other and no one gets through under
their own merit alone. My hope is to continue to push through and do so with
a smile and a hoard of cohort mates to tackle any and all situations together.
