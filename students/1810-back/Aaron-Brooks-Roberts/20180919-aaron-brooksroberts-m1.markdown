## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal in this Module was to learn the skill of creating code that actually works
and developing a solid foundation and a style to build on as a career comes into
question. Learning to code using TDD was one of the pertinent keys I needed to begin
understanding the scope of what we're working through in code. It took a long time
to get to this place as the Mod moved very quickly from day one with little to no time
given to catch up. After going back to the beginning mid one of the projects, I learned
a very valuable lesson and I do feel much more successful than when we started this.

My main area of opportunity would be time management as I found myself working long hours
into the morning and losing sleep in the long run. This caused the rest of my learning to
honestly suffer as I couldn't always concentrate on the task at hand. In the future I
think I will consider my body more and focus on what I specifically need to learn to be
able to better understand the work in front of me. I also didn't know that I could ask for
help individually from the staff given their schedules and had only learned that in the
last couple of weeks.

## Projects

My favorite project in this mod was by far Black Thursday. Working with a partner who had
skills that I didn't yet possess made my learning grow even more. We took the project and
broke it into smaller chunks which made the moving parts more cohesive and ultimately point
us toward our goal of reaching a higher iteration than previous projects.

I also enjoyed taking a little bit of time off in stress to work on the lightning talk. This
broke up the constant screen of my computer locked on Atom and gave me a little time to really
focus on something else for a change. I was proud of the work I did, even though I babbled
through the presentation and didn't even get close to a 5 min time frame.

My least favorite project was Enigma because my partner and I worked so hard for all of the
days given and were only able to inch along the spec. It's so frustrating while you're trying
to pick up the pieces you've missed, learn new lessons in a day that may be related or unrelated
work hard on a project and not sleep, then repeat day after day with little advancement.

My independent projects suffered some of the same feats as I didn't want my learning to
suffer in the long run so I concentrated more on my understanding of the exercises and previous
tests to figure out what I was missing rather than a project in most cases I was unable to
fully understand what was honestly being asked of me.

## Community

I honestly believe that I learned a lot from meeting certain students and working through
some of the struggles we might have been having which helped me tremendously. I saw these first
hand and ended up taking conferences on the side to go over these missing pieces. In those
moments I felt like I might have helped improve someone's experience which in turn allowed me
to feel good about myself even though I don't believe I've arrived by any means.

Next mod I really need to focus on myself and getting passed this mod. I've spent too much time
worrying about my position in the class and who's better than me and why, that I missed out on
necessary skills that could propel me in my learning curve since I'm not like anyone else.
