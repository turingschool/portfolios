## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of Module Assesment taken with David Whitaker.  (Flying colors and everything.)  


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module we had several individual projects. We had three static comp projects including dog party, static comp 1 and static comp 2. We also had a full individual project called foto-finder. 

#### fotoFinder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dylhof/dh-fotoFinder.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

In this project we created a website where users can upload and post photos to an album. They have a submission form where they can enter a title and a caption and upload a photo.  If all three fields are not filled in, they should not be able to submit their photo.  Once photos are posted they should be able to delete them from the page or add favorite status to them. The user should also be able to search through their photo posts in the search field at the top.  All of these posts and changes should persist in local storage when the user refreshes their page. 

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dylhof/dh-Comp-challenge-1.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was a static comp project where we were expected to recreate a static image using HTML and CSS.  While we had artistic license with colors, icons and copy, we were required to recreate the layout with as much accuracy as possible. This Static comp was a social media type site with a header and posted 'cards' below. 

In this project I learned a lot about using css flex as well as color theory. 

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dylhof/dh-comp-challenge2.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project was a static comp project where we were expected to recreate a static image using HTML and CSS.  While we had artistic license with colors, icons and copy, we were required to recreate the layout with as much accuracy as possible. This Static comp was a job website with a job posting in the main section.  It had two levels of header bar as well as a pop out side bar and an aside with social media buttons.  It also included graphs. 

In this project I learned a lot about using css grid and styling for checkboxes. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In this module we had two colaborative projects.  The first was a paired project called NumberGuesser which turned into NumberGuesser Doubles.  The second was a group project was called Idea Box.

#### NumberGuesser Doubles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Klhalls89/NumberGuesserDouble.git)
* [Original Assignment week 1](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)
* [Original Assignment week 2](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Number Guesser was a game where the computer randomly generated a number between 1 and 100 and you as the player would guess the number with feedback such as 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' given and your guess displayed on one half of the screen.  When you guessed the number correctly the message was 'Boom' and a new game was started with a number between -10 and 110. The player also has the ability to set their own range to make the game as difficult as they want.  

The second week of the project turned this one player game into a two player game.  The fundamentals of the game were the same but there were two user inputs for the guessed number and the player's name and two displays for the user guesses.  When a user won the game they would see a card generated on one half of the screen which displays that they won and how many guesses it took to get the winning answer. 

In this project I learned a lot about pair programming and working with a partner.  I also learned a lot about how to use javascript to interact with the DOM. 

##### Feedback Given
* in a good place to refactor
* some buggy behavior needs to be fixed
* UI fine turning needs to happen
* responsiveness is in place, need to tighten up layout and make sure all UI elements are really well executed -- watch out for details

##### Scores
Functional Expectations: 1/2
COMP RECREATION / DESIGN: 2/3
HTML: 2/3
CSS: 2/3
JS/jQuery: 2/3
Surprise and Delight:
* Unicorn Rainbows
* Hot Fire
* Sparkles
* Magic

#### Idea Box
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kaohman/idea-box.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

This was a group (of three) project.  In this project we needed to create a website were the user can post their ideas to an 'idea box' by filling in a small form with a title and a body.  When the user clicks submit, the idea would be appended a card to the body of the page containing the idea.  If they decide the idea could use an update later on, they can double click on the title or the body of the card and edit the idea, saving it when they press the enter key or click on the page off the card. The user can also rate their idea using well known swill, plausible, genius, unicorn and magic scale.  They can then filter their ideas by searching keywords or by rating. 

In this project I learned about how to use a class to instanciate objects using nodes on the DOM. I also learned a lot about dealing with conflicts on gitHub.

##### Feedback Given
* Really nice work creating lots of commits
  * Continue to keep working on more detailed commits (what specifically did you refactor)
  * Nice work with creating more branches.  Continue to make more branches, but nice improvement.
* Really clean and effective UI
  * I would make sure that the letters wrap around when typing long messages
  * Make sure that the cards come back in the correct order when clicking show more, less, all, etc.
* Might add a bit more spacing between buttons and cards on mobile view
* Use spans only when you need to.  For example, h1, style it one way and then use a span to style one word differently 
  * I would keep similar/related inputs in one form and then a couple divs to style things
  * Keep classes for styling purposes, and for javascript use ids so you can grab that element
* Nice work with organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
  * For BEMS or SMACCS, look into formatting of names of styles (if SMACCS, divide things into layers like class `l-card-section`)
  * Some good areas where you are grouping styles.  A few more sections where classes that have similar widths or flex properties that could be grouped together as well
* I would suggest making the array of qualities locally scoped instead of global since it is static and does not need to change
* Nice work with filtering
  * When trying to add the display none, use classes instead of inline styles
  * I would challenge you to remove elements from the DOM instead of doing display none
* Nice work using array prototypes over for loops
* Nice work creating functions that you can reuse
* Cheers on jumping into using arrow functions and exploring some es6
* Some really creative ways of reducing code, like using a forEach on the inputs and adding similar event listeners

##### Scores

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended the first meeting of the Joan Clark society as well as several morning talks.  I also tried to support my cohort by offering to talk through any issues they were experiencing, either technically or emotionally.  I also tried to suppor the community by helping to keep the space clean and usable.
