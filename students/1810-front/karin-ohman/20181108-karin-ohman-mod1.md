## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Pair and group projects for Module 1 included Number Guesser and Idea Box. Both of these projects involved taking our JavaScript knowledge and implementation to the next level to create interactive websites.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kaohman/num-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

This project was a pair project and included creating a random number guessing game. During the first week of the project, we built a one-person game where the user can make guesses and win the game. In the second week of the project, we pivoted to making a two-person game where users can play each other to guess the random number. The functionality included the ability to update the random number range, submit guesses, view submitted guesses, view past winners, and see how many guesses and how long it took to win each game.

* Notes/What To Work On: Great job! Really solid first project, loved that y'all added the time tracking functionality.
* HTML: Nice work, maybe be more consistent with class order in that class declaration.
* CSS: Consider adding organizational comments. Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes. Consider using a naming methodology like css BEM.
* JS: Love that you're using a user class. Keep things local unless they need to be global. Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up. Style looked great. Could consider writing the template literal as if its html


* Functional Expectations: Proficient
* Comp Recreation: Proficient/Exceptional
* HTML: Proficient
* CSS: Proficient
* JS: Proficient/Exceptional

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kaohman/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

This project was a 3-person group project to develop a website for creating and saving ideas. The functionality allows the user to create new ideas, view ideas in the DOM, edit ideas, filter and search by text, update and filter by idea quality, show varying numbers of ideas, and delete ideas.

* Really nice work creating lots of commits
  * Continue to keep working on more detailed commits (what specifically did you refactor)
  * Nice work with creating more branches. Continue to make more branches, but nice improvement.
* Really clean and effective UI
  * I would make sure that the letters wrap around when typing long messages
  * Make sure that the cards come back in the correct order when clicking show more, less, all, etc.
* Might add a bit more spacing between buttons and cards on mobile view
* Use spans only when you need to. For example, h1, style it one way and then use a span to style one word differently
  * I would keep similar/related inputs in one form and then a couple divs to style things
  * Keep classes for styling purposes, and for javascript use ids so you can grab that element
* Nice work with organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
  * For BEMS or SMACCS, look into formatting of names of styles (if SMACCS, divide things into layers like class l-card-section)
  * Some good areas where you are grouping styles. A few more sections where classes that have similar widths or flex properties that could be grouped together as well
* I would suggest making the array of qualities locally scoped instead of global since it is static and does not need to change
* Nice work with filtering
  * When trying to add the display none, use classes instead of inline styles
  * I would challenge you to remove elements from the DOM instead of doing display none
* Nice work using array prototypes over for loops
* Nice work creating functions that you can reuse
* Cheers on jumping into using arrow functions and exploring some es6
* Some really creative ways of reducing code, like using a forEach on the inputs and adding similar event listeners


* Functional Expectations: Exceptional
* Comp Recreation: Exceptional
* HTML: Proficient
* CSS: Proficient
* JS: Proficient

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module I attended many community events including all Friday activities, many Friday morning speakers, and Demo Comp. I was an active participant throughout the module but did not necessarily go above and beyond to support the community as I was just getting a feel for the environment. Within my cohort, I supported other members of my class by assisting them with technical problems and questions. Next module I hope to expand my support of the community through pairing with lower mods and actively participating in student groups and posses.
