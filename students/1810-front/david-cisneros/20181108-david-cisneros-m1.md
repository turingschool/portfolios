### Evaluation Comments:
* Be sure to use forms for inputs and associated buttons
* Consider adding organizational comments
* Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
* Look for duplication as you build
* Write with good style on the fly
* Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.

* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1810/mod-1/idea-box/matthew-heather-david.md)

### Description:
Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

### Evaluation Comments:
* watch stylistic consistency within the codebase -- alternate between rem and em for font-size and using 0 vs 0px
* HTML is generally well named and well structured, a couple of places that a more modular approach could be used to make classes more reusable
* JS has some areas that could use refactor
* showMoreLessCards() function uses an approach to hide/show cards beyond 10 that is very hacky and won't hold up to user testing (adds or removes a fixed height on the parent card container with no overflow) -- not a true solution for this functionality
