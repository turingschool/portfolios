# Duy Vu - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn about front-end development. I wanted to know what the applications that I use on a daily basis consists of. I also wanted to experience the people inside the world of CS as well. I have always found that thepeople in this field are very diverse in the way that they think. I enjoyed meeting and talking to different people everyday.

## A: End of Module Assessment



## B: Individual Work & Projects

For the individual projects, we were tasked with three different projects. They were dog-party, static-comp1, staic-comp2, and Foto-finder.

#### Dog Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Rosebud303/Dog-Party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/dog-party.html)

Dog-party was a project to introduce us to how html and css work together to style a page.

#### Static-Comp1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Rosebud303/DV-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was meant to challenge us with more difficult ways of styling a page using css and html. For this project we were allowed to use flex which made the styling aspect of it easier since we had more tools at our disposal.

#### Static-Comp2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Rosebud303/Static_Comp_2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For our final static comp we were asked to style a page using all the previous knowledge that we had gained from before but also with a new tool: Grid. Grid allowed me to be more free with my styling and also is very intuitive. I love grid forever and ever and ever.

#### Foto-Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Rosebud303/Foto-Finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

For this project we were expected to make a fully functional photo finder. We were expected to make a site where the user was able to favorite and delete cards that were created. This had to be done using localStorage. WHich meant that were were suppose to be able to let the user pull from the localStorage as well as delete from it. Our app was also expected allow the user to see the cards that they favorited as well.

## C: Group Work & Projects

For these group projects, we were expected to work with our fellow classmates to created functioning applications. The two group projects that we had to do were: Number-Guesser and IdeaBox.

#### Number-Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Rosebud303/Number-Guesser-Doubles)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

This was our first group project in the class. In this project we were expected to make a game that allowed two players to play a guessing game about numbers against each other. Our application was meant to be able to take in inputs by the user to test if they guessed the right number. The number was randomly generated when the page loads or reloads or the correct number was guessed. Our game was also meant to print a card displaying the person that won at the end of each round and also increase and decrease the range of numbers that could be guessed in between. The game also gave clues to the user/users if they guessed too high or too low.

## Student: Duy Thanh Vu & Adam Niedzwiecki
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Create many more commits and many more branches.
  * Clearer descriptions for commits and branches.
* A few bugs with error handling
* Not responsive yet.  Work on responsiveness and mobile view
* Continue to focus on semantic HTML like header or main instead of divs/sections
* Careful of using too many nested divs
* Use a form when you have multiple inputs and buttons
* Try to reuse classes for elements that are styled the same
* Make sure to organize properties of classes alphabetically
* Create organization of styles for developer empathy
* Some good uses of grouping (continue to do so or reuse one class)
* Make sure you follow CSS styleguide
* Good organization of js using global variables, event listeners, and function delcarations
* Clean up console.logs before eval
* Give a button a default state of disabled in HTML instead of JS
* Some good use of keeping functions SRP (continue to work on this)
* I like how you made it dynamic and reused a function for submitAnswer
* Careful of using nested if/else statements


## Functional Expectations

* Novice: Application meets most of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished.


## COMP RECREATION / DESIGN

* Novice  


## HTML

* Advanced Beginner  


## CSS

* Advanced Beginner  


## JS/jQuery

* Advanced Beginner  


## Surprise and Delight (reminder: have fun!)

* Hot Fire  

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TomWilhoit/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

For Idea box our group was expected to create a card generator that allowed the user to create cards with ideas on them. Each card had to have a title and body which could be edited and saved to localStorage. Also each idea should have been able to change in quality by clicking quality changing buttons that go up or down. The app should also include a search input whihc allowed users to sort through the ideas that they wanted to see.

## Student: Duy, Tom, and Niroz
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

Make sure if something is data related to use the `data-*` attributes in js

#### HTML
* Good use of semantic elements
* Clean HTML stylistically

#### CSS
* Consider leveraging more relative units particularly for widths
* Consider using organizational comments and alphabetizing within rules so that
  you're able to find things more easily

#### JS
* You all seem to have a good understanding of what's going on in the codebase,
  which is great.
* DRY it up. Whenever there are 3 lines shared between functions, that should be
  its own function
* Be sure to use your debugging tools as you go. Line by line

### Functional Expectations

*  Novice - Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, and those changes persist in `localStorage`
*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds 'Changing the quality of an idea' and enables 'Filtering and Searching by Text' as defined in the spec

### Comp Recreation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Novice - Crafts CSS according to the turing css style guide

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was always apart of the community at Turing socially. I met new people for 3 weeks straight before I felt like i met everyone attending Turing. The biggest way that I was involved at Turing was trying to encourage other students. When they had a problem either personal or Turing related I always allowed them to come to me and vent while also giving them feed back if they asked for it.
