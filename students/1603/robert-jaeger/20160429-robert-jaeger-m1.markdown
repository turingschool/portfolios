# Robert Jaeger - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* Become more familiar with Ruby - learn what Ruby is useful for and what are its shortcomings
* Become a quick worker with the tools we are using
* Establish a sustainable work-life balanced schedule
* Learn how to program as a developer in a complex system, not as a post processing script writer

### End of Module Assessment

**Assessed by:** Jhun de Andres

**Result:** Pass

#### Feedback

**Notes:** Robbie did a great job testing and driving his development. I could tell he was nervous which is natural. His implementation of the code displayed to me that he knew what he was doing and he knew where he was going.


#### Scores
1. **Ruby Syntax & API** - ​3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

2. **Completion and Progress** - ​3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

3. **Testing** - ​3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

4. **Workflow** - ​3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

5. **Collaboration** - ​3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

6. **Enumerable & Collections** - ​3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## Team

### Projects

I completed HTTP Yeah You Know Me and Black Thursday with scores of 3 or above.

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lucyfox4131/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)
* [Eval](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1603/http_or_hyde/jaeger_fox.markdown)

##### Description
A simple **HTTP server** constructed in Ruby. The server can accept GET and POST request from a client only to specific localhost addresses. The server also uses redirects to give the client information (in the game section of the assignment).

##### Evaluation Comments: (Jhun)
* There were a couple of long methods. That's kind of hard to get away from esp with the main file. What I did see is that they moved the logic into other methods within the other classes. I liked that. I stuck to the single-responsiblity rule.
* I liked the test. Some of the classes were tested indirectly. I game them a 3.5 because of how broken down they where. There is some room for improvement but I feel like they were pretty much there.
* This goes hand in hand with the FR&S. I liked how this group was holding to keeping things clean and simple. One method does one thing.

##### Evaluation Scores:
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4


#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

* [Eval](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1603/bt_or_hc/luigi_robbie_peter.markdown)

##### Description
A **business analytics** program that constructs a basic database system with relationships between repositories. The sales analyst can generate business metrics and analyses for merchants, items, invoices, and transactions.

##### Evaluation Comments:

### Giving Feedback

> **Luigi Aversano:** Luigi and I were grouped together for the Black Thursday project. He has awesome determination. He worked through some very difficult, valuable parts of the Black Thursday project, and continued to push through them until they worked perfectly. One thing that seemed to help Luigi get through tough coding problems was taking a step back, thinking about the problem in pieces, and writing pseudocode, which could be a great asset in the future. For our project, we had to come in to work during the weekend, and I could always count on Luigi to sacrifice personal time for the project and come ready to work hard.

> **Lucy Fox:** Lucy is a very strong programmer to say the least. She has a great methodology for breaking down problems into sizable chunks and solving them piece by piece. We paired on HTTP Yeah You Know Me, and she would usually diagram everything and talk through things aloud. This was a great asset to both of us because we were always on the same page throughout the project. Lucy has said she is a very competitive person, which proves she is ambitious and driven, but in the future it might lead to being hard on herself unnecessarily. All through the project, I could always count on Lucy to work hard, above and beyond expectations of the project spec. Overall, Lucy was awesome to work with, and I wouldn’t hesitate to work with her again in the future.

> **Peter Springer:** I was grouped with Peter on the Black Thursday project. He was very easy to work with and worked hard on his share of the project. During the project, Peter got hung up on some difficult parts, but by the end of the project, he got better at breaking down problems into smaller pieces instead of trying to tackle the big picture right away. I could always trust Peter to be committed to the project.

> **Brian Sayler:** Brian is an awesome problem solver and fun to work with. We had done code pairing sessions together, and we were always on the same page. It was easy to feel comfortable working alongside him. When he wasn’t working on his own project, I often saw him selflessly offering help to other people who seemed to be struggling. Sometimes Brian can get hung up on a bug for a long period of time. It might help him in the future if he can hone his debugging skills or find ways to change tasks to keep productivity high. Overall, Brian is a great asset to the cohort, and it would be a pleasure to work with Brian again, to say the least.


### Being a Community Member
> Robbie has been a great resource and pairing partner during module one. He has sharp technical skills and an great attitude that makes him pleasure to work with.  Each time we coded together we got into a good flow and worked effectively as as unit to solve a problem. We also came up with some pretty dope methods.  Robbie’s approachable personality and genuine desire to help you understand problems conceptually make him an excellent person to help solve those juicy coding problems. I look forward to working with Robbie in the next module. **- Brian Sayler**

> I feel lucky having had the chance to work with Robbie for our first pair project. Though we had a few minor git issues along the way I was very impressed with his problem solving and code skills. It's evident when working with Robbie that he has put a lot of time into learning proper Ruby style and syntax. Throughout the project he always knew the right enumerable/method to use to get the job done. Robbie takes the time to thoroughly explain his ideas and thought process clearly. I appreciated that he always made sure that both of us understood the problem we were tackling so that we could find the best way to solve it. **- Lucy Fox**

> I worked with Robbie on the final project, Black Thursday. Robbie is incredibly hard working and smart. What was most helpful to me was his patience in explaining key concepts with the project. Many times Robbie put me in the position to drive the code. It was a struggle, and lengthened the time our project took to complete but it made me a better programmer and I am truly thankful for that opportunity. He is a consummate team player. **- Luigi Aversano**

> Even though Robbie's programming skills far exceeded mine we were still able to work collaboratively. He was great at breaking down complex problems and talking through how to solve them. His friendly demeanor and strong programming skills made him a pleasure to work with. **-Peter Springer**

* Helped others with projects when I could


## Review

### Self Assessment

**A. End-of-Module Assessment:** 3

I was more nervous than I should have been, and I didn't drive the assessment as much as I should have. I was looking to the assessor too much for signs of if what I was doing was correct and if I should move to the next task.

**B. Individual Work & Projects:** 3

All individual projects were successful (3's and 4's). I have room to grow with class single responsibility.

**C. Group Work & Projects:** 3

All group projects were successful (3's and 4's). I'm still working on how to divide work between group members. I'm also working on improving my git workflow.

**D. Community Participation:** 3

I've been participating within my posse (Ritchie) and participated in the Hackathon (RhymeThis).

**E. Peer & Instructor Feedback:** 3

In my feedback, I gave at least one point of constructive criticism for each person.
