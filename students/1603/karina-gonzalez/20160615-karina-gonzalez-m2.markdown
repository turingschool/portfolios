### Areas of Emphasis

  Coming into this module I remember having a heavy case of the infamous "imposter's syndrome".  I suppose it's difficult for me to imagine that I deserve to be here when I have frequent conversations with my extremely intelligent and capable family members/friends from home who weren't quite as lucky. That being said, one of my major goals for this module was to phase out of the "victim" role and into a more authoritative role.  I realize that I am in a position where, depending upon how much I take advantage of this opportunity, I could progress into a position where I could actually empower my fellow humans who can who come from similar roots. (Also, I wanted to learn more about machine learning, which I did ... learned a bit about linear regression but I'd like to learn more)

  “I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.” - Toni Morrison

### Work

I was having a particularly difficult time when the mini project was assigned.  I feared I was much too inadequate to continue in the module.  So, knowing myself and how self deprecating I can be at times) instead of attempting to write a rails app, I decided to prioritize my mental health.  This was a particularly sunny weekend so I decided to purchase a book beautifully embellished with John Keats' collected poems and read those to replenish myself instead. Here is an excerpt form the book that inspired me to suck it up and simply TRY (bc, like all organic matter, we're all going to be recycled eventually).
(Willing to develop something over break)

#### When I have Fears That I May Cease to Be

        - When I have fears that I may cease to be
    - Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
    - Before high-pilèd books, in charactery,
    - Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
    - When I behold, upon the night’s starred face,
    - Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
    - And think that I may never live to trace
    - Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
    - And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
    - That I shall never look upon thee more,
    - Never have relish in the faery power
    - Of unreflecting love—then on the shore
    - Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
    - Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Assessed By: Andrew

Notes for extended submission:

    - Views have a lot of logic. Mostly formatting
    - Tests can use more work - But better. Think about better ways to refactor to use methods to help create data.
    - No feature tests
    - Base functionality is there.

##### Evaluation Rubric

###### 1. Functional Expectations: 3
###### 2. Test-Driven Development: 2
###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
###### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
###### 6. View Layer: 2

### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

      - App broke on creation of new family. Looks like twillio. Will give time to fix to bring score up.
      - One query in view. Nationalities.all. Refactor to controller. The use of partials and presenters cancel our the logic int he view for a score of 4. Happy to user attempts at using presenters.
      - Using session hash for cart quantity - would prefer the supply to call quantity
      - SupplyItem.find_family(id) should be SupplyItem.find(id).family => trying to write method that active record handle already.
      - Donation controller still has iteration over supply items to crate donation items. Would like to see that refactored to an object that handles the completion of donations
      - Creating supply_items within family model. We should refactor this to a poro or just somewhere other than a different model.
      - Also, consider a stats object instead of pulling in data from multiple different models for statistics
      - Highly suggest helper methods in test suite to make your life easier. Overall tests at multiple levels and multiple paths

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* To Kerry: Kerry, I can honestly say that I am very grateful to have met you.  As an extremely confused human in a very transitional time in her life, I feel as if I spend an inordinate amount of time grasping at the thin wisps of air which faintly resemble those qualities — THOSE QUALITIES— you know? Those qualities that my inner child most sincerely and passionately desires. I say this because, when in your presence, I can almost feel my clammy, thin fingertips tightly wound themselves around that wisdom which your breath so graciously solidifies.  Suddenly those qualities— YOUR QUALITIES— the time management, innate curiosity, generosity, kindness, mindfulness, boldness, intelligence, and sense of humor sprinkled with a healthy amount of skepticism— suddenly, those qualities seem well within my reach.  I thank you for your influence, not only on a personal scale, but on a global scale.  Devs and humans alike are lucky to have you.

* To Robbie: Robbie, I know you as one of those students at Turing who, no matter what, will ALWAYS be willing to help, fueled only by your curiosity and compassion. It’s so refreshing getting to interact with someone who makes such a conscious effort to maintain a growth mindset on a daily basis. It’s funny because I remember being faintly intimidated by you last module. But I’m grateful to have been paired with you on Little Shop because now I have been exposed to your witty sense of humor and inspiring work ethic. You are this human who is equal parts capable, hard-working and mindful. I sincerely believe that your innovative perspective will only enhance any projects you choose to contribute to in the future. Turing is lucky to have you.


### Being a Community Member

* From Kerry:
Karina is super talented and, quite simply, a lovely person.  I believe that Karina’s talent is nearly unmatched within our cohort.  Karina’s skills and interests are so diverse that I think she often spreads herself thin across many different endeavors.  Her innate talent allows her to do this yet still perform up to expectations.  I think Karina has the ability to be exceptional in some areas if she were to focus on fewer interests, but I also acknowledge that such focus may not be Karina’s style (which is totally fine, in my opinion...).
I’m sure Karina is  aware that her attendance and punctuality are not her strong suits.  While Karina missed some work time with our group on our project, it was never detrimental to our group as a whole.  However, future groups may be less willing or able to adapt to these circumstances, so it’s an area that Karina may want to improve.   With that said, Karina pulled her weight throughout the Little Shop project and made significant contributions. I enjoyed pairing with Karina and benefitting from her creativity, energy, and friendship.
* From Nick: Karina,
I greatly appreciate your spirit, willingness to learn, and ability to methodically work through some of the issues we’re having.  My frustrations for this project have been mounting for the past few days, partly due to our reluctance to make significant progress.  I feel that you can become fixated on minutia during certain times, when we may be in the midst of searching for a bug. Instead of focusing on how variables are named, other issues you are thinking of, or whatever stylistic things that may be happening, sometimes I feel we’re getting a little off track and just need to push through the spec and focus and finish the task at hand.
You have been very communicative with me when you’re frustrated and have suggested adaptations and improvements to our group dynamic.  I notice that you get frustrated at certain times and walk away for periods of time, which I understand may be a coping mechanism of sorts, but is kind of a set back when we have to wait for you.  However, I want you to know that I am open to your suggestions and respect your ideas.  I apologize if I have displaced any of my frustrations with this project on you; I genuinely appreciate your attitude and all that you bring to the group :slightly_smiling_face:

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Environment Variables- hosted a single meeting halfway through the mod and came to the conclusion that I should just hold off until the beginning of next module.

Pahlka Posse member -
* Pahlka met on a consistent basis 3/4 times a week.

* I paired with July to help set up the Map of Denver (wrote JavaScript for the first time in order to do so.). Mostly worked on refactoring little things.

* My favorite thing about my experience with Pahlka was having the privilege to interact with such enthusiastic humanists on a daily basis. I also loved the opportunity to pre-maturely get exposed to APIs, Rails, and JavaScript. Everyone was also super willing to help out quite literally ANYTHING. This has rubbed off on me, I used to be tentative about helping out lower module students in the beginning of Mod2 because I myself felt like such a noob. But Pahlkas approach at pairing, the whole "present a problem and we'll both utilize the tools at our disposal to solve it together", has really helped subside the nerves when pairing and thus, I feel, has made my pairings significantly more effective.

* The benefit to me as a professional has definitely been the emphasis on structure.  Pahlka's leading member's, without fail, always had an outline prepared for our meetings which set the stage for our efficient usage of time  


Tutoring - Paired with a 1605 students every time that it was organized by Brain. Also did some extra pairing with Pahlka and fellow headcounters.
