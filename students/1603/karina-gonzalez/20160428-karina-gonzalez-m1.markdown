# Karina Munoz Gonzalez - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

  A central focus for this module, apart from gaining a fundamental understanding of Ruby, was definitely enumerables.  They seemed to be the most convoluted concept for me in the beginning. So, in order to eradicate this fear of them, I simply made it a point to utilize them for every project.  I also focused a lot on improving my workflow via key shortcuts, iterm, and atom.

## Solo Projects
--------------------------------------------
#### JungleBeats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/junglebeats)
* Assessed By: Tess

Introduction to Linked Lists. Great first project, established a solid foundation for understanding how to make objects interact in Ruby.


Notes: Pretty solid overall. Keep an eye on the counter method; it was a bit hairy

##### 1. Functional Expectations: 4
##### 2. Test-Driven Development: 3

##### 5. Looping or Recursion: 3
-----------------------------------------------------------
#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/enigma)
* Assessed By: Nate

Great practice for enumerables.  Designed with the WWII Enigma in mind.  
Created an encryptor, takes in your message and key to encrypt message, a decryptor, decrypts said message given the key, and a crack method which is able to decrypt given message assuming that it ends in ..end.. .


Notes:

* Talked about some tricks and made a pull request with changes
* Really great test coverage
* Good use of enumerables
* Indentation and general cleanup was needed

##### 1. Overall Functionality: 4
##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

### http_yeah_you_know_me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* Assessed by: Juhn

Http requires one to build a server. Introduction to the purpose of headers, faraday, localhosts, and postman.

##### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2
##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components:3.5

### headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/headcount)
* Assessed By: jhunbug

Headcount was a great introduction to databases.  This project required thorough understanding of how to manipulate hashes, enumerables, and handling of csvs.

Notes: - group shows understanding of project and code looks good. They lost a day due to a waffle problem. Horace and Mike are aware. There are solid attempts to try to move things into single responsibility methods and attempts to write solid test. I believe that if they had another day they would of been better off.

##### 1. Functional Expectations:2
##### 2. Test-Driven Development: 3+
##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3+
##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
##### 5. Enumerable & Collections: 4
##### 6. Code Sanitation: 4

### Giving Feedback

* To Nick Dorans: Nick’s nickname “nonaps” reached me through the vine before I even met him.  I took note of the positive nature in which his nickname would come up, and became eager to meet this sleep-deprived individual. I finally got the pleasure of speaking with him when we got paired for a group retro—   I remember being taken aback by his open-mindedness, eloquent way of expressing his ideas, and his effortless ability to mediate even the most controversial conversations with his light-hearted levity.  It seems after that initial introduction Nick has only solidified that great first impression-- he’s heavily involved in most altruistic outlets in Turing and I deeply admire that. I still don’t really know why they call him no-naps. But I think it’s safe to assume that the countless amount of hours he spends spends coding, compassionately explaining difficult concepts to his peers, and being an overall kind-hearted activist, might have a lot to do with it.

* To Sunny: Sunny is one of those students at Turing who, no matter what, will ALWAYS be willing to help. He will work for hours on someone else’s problem fueled only by his curiosity and compassion. He is such a radiating presence who makes even the most tedious code problem, enjoyable. It’s so refreshing getting to interact with someone who makes such a conscious effort to maintain a growth mindset on a daily basis.  Thank you sunny for being so open thus allowing for others to benefit from your unique perspective. 


### Being a Community Member
* From Marlo Major:
  Karina and I come from similar backgrounds, we enjoy similar things, and it was nice getting to know her during this module. Always seeking for more help, she was relentless in her desire to understand and write great code. Her constant enthusiasm, regardless of what’s going on around her, is something I am glad I  could have been a part of. She is bright and works hard. She tries to do the best she can no matter what the costs. My only critique of Karina is for her to talk to someone when she feels the need to express herself instead of holding everything in. I honestly can’t wait to see where she goes. Karina you will go so far!

* From Nick Dorans:
   Karina is a really cool girl, I knew that before I even met her because she was heavily involved in the Turing Hip Hop channel on Slack. Once I did meet her, I realized she’s a very intelligent girl who’s very passionate about different things. Things like public health, the environment, global issues in general, and art - all of which are things that I am also passionate about. Although I haven’t paired with her directly on a project, I have given her some help with a project or two and I noticed that she’s very quick to pick up on new concepts. She’s a pretty good programmer and one hell of a pseudo coder! I gave her major props for being the only team that wanted to do Headcount for their final project - someone had to do it! I believe Karina will do very well in the Turing program, and go on to be a great web developer. She’s already added great value to the Turing community at large.

* From Jon Liss:
  Karina when I first paired with you, you told me that you started the project late and after working on it for a while you said you were going to work on it at home and left.  I totally thought you were just giving up on it, but not only did you finish it, you did really well!  And now every time I see you working on a project, you’ve got a clear understanding of how to go about solving the problems presented to you, and what needs to be done to get there.  And when you do call me over for help with the usual “Lisssssssssss!”, you ask difficult questions that show me that you really do understand all the concepts of the problem, but just need a little nudge in the right direction.  I think you're doing everything right and you’re gonna crush mods 2-4!


* From Aaron Greenspan:
   I’ve paired a number of times with Karina on her past two projects.  She’s equal parts curious, excited, and (highly) capable.  She also brings a light-heartedness to her work which makes it a blast to code with her and easy to code well.  I have never once heard Karina ask for clarification on a concept, plan, or code implementation.  This is certainly a testament to her uncanny ability to grasp a thing quickly.  But, I also wonder if Karina is hesitant to ask a big question and admit that something just isn’t making sense.  If so, I hope Karina comes to believe as I do that those questions don’t at all make one appear any less competent, but instead achieve the opposite.  Such questions will both speed her own progress and, most importantly, allow her colleagues to more readily benefit from her unique thought process and viewpoint.

### Playing a Part

* From Marcella Wigg :
   Karina inspired me with her resourcefulness and drive as a partner, and I feel fortunate to have worked with her. Early on in the first module, I hesitated in asking other students for help, but Karina not only showed me that asking higher-module students for help is acceptable, she introduced me to students I now feel using as references in the future! The long hours she puts in at Turing show both her drive to succeed in her coding and her strong involvement with the Turing community.

* From Erin Greenhalgh:
    It has been a pleasure working with Karina on Headcount. This was a daunting project, and I was impressed again and again with Karina’s even-tempered resolve to dig into a problem, learn about it, and find a solution. Karina’s programming and problem solving skills are sharp, and she knows the right questions to ask to get to the root of a problem. She is also a caring friend and sunny individual who easily makes bonds with other people in the program. I admire her dedication and her skill and look forward to working with her more in the future.
