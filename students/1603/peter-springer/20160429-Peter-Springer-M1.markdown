Build a basic drum machine program utilizing a linked list.

Assessed By: Lovisa

Notes:

Good use of testing! Be aware of edge cases/sad path tests
nice use of looping
try to refactor out "units" of code in longer if/elsif/else statements
be aware of indentation and general formatting (no worries, it comes with time)
good grasp of attr's and use of ivars -- no need for @ sign if you have attr's

## Team

### Projects

Team projects worked on this module:

#### (Hyde)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Build a "Static Site Generator" that allows the author to write content in a writing-friendly format, then the system generates HTML and puts it all together.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

20 tests total
100 percent coverage
I liked how granular the tests were.
Some opportunities for refactoring in pulling out conditionals to methods and pulling out long chains into methods.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

Build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Assessed By: jhunbug

Notes:

Code is good.
Wished code had modules or refactored to parsing methods to be a little more agnostic
some good enumerables

* Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
* Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* Code Sanitation

* The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

* 4: Zero complaints


## Community

### Giving Feedback

HYDE-Charlie is easy to work with. He is an encouraging and patient teammate that I would be happy to work with again.

HYDE-Colin and I worked together briefly during the Hyde project. It was nice to work with someone who had been through the struggle before and see how he approached problems. Colin shared some details with me about his first experience taking module 1 and how difficult it was for him. Since I have also found module 1 to be quite difficult it was great to hear about where he started and see how far he has come. Colin is great to work with and his trajectory is inspiring.

BLACK THURSDAY-Even though Robbie's programming skills far exceeded mine we were still able to work collaboratively. He was great at breaking down complex problems and talking through how to solve them. His friendly demeanor and strong programming skills made him a pleasure to work with.



### Being a Community Member

**feedback from Horace**

* would like to see the process of translating ideas into code getting more fluid and quicker
* especially would be good to practice reading and mentally processing code to make that comprehension
process quicker
* some time spent diagramming or tagging the elements in code could also be beneficial

**feedback from Colin**

I worked with Peter back a few weeks ago while working on the Hyde project. Peter was helping with solving an issue with ERB and trying to help his partner and myself to wrap our heads around the challenge. Even when things got frustrating after hours of trying, Peter remained calm and kept us all motivated to keep working hard towards the end goal. I feel that with more time, his skills and understanding will snowball and heâ€™ll turn into an awesome developer. Working with Peter was great because it was clear he was determined to learn

**feedback from Charlie**

I had a great time working with Pete on hyde.  I had a couple of scheduling constraints that week and he was extremely flexible and more than willing to accommodate my schedule. We were able to make good progress every day by being on the same page and getting right down to business.  Pete was a supportive partner and always eager to solve the problems we ran into.  I would definitely work with him again.

**feedback from Robbie**

I was grouped with Peter on the Black Thursday project. He was very easy to work with and worked hard on his share of the project. During the project, Peter got hung up on some difficult parts, but by the end of the project, he got better at breaking down problems into smaller pieces instead of trying to tackle the big picture right away. I could always trust Peter to be committed to the project.


### Playing a Part

I participated in the myamoto posse throughout the module and also during the hackathon.
