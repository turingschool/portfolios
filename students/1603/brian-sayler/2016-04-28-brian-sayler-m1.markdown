Brian Sayler - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I come to Turing to build the technical skills that will allow me to have a rewarding career in software. During the first module, I'd like to understand the specifics of the Ruby language and mastering object oriented programming.

I will also focus on engaging with my peers and becoming a part of the Turing community. I'd like to maximize the amount of time I spend working with others, since I know that I will be working in teams for the rest of my career.

###### Description:

Second project, from Week 2. The project was designed to introduce the binary search tree data structure, and to teach us to effectively use recursion to traverse the tree. In this implementation, we loaded movie titles and scores into the BST.

###### Evaluation Comments:

Assessed By: Lovisa
* good testing overall, could use more sad path tests, refactor out duplicate setups
* nice use of recursion and looping
* very neat code, easy to read and understand
* with attr's, no need to use the @ sign in your program (unless we are setting the value, need to prepend with `self.`)
* `#insert` is the only method that's in need of some TLC (refactor out left/right)

###### Description:

This REPL game was assigned Week 3. It was the first foray into a larger object-oriented program in Ruby.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Assessed By: Mike
Notes:
* Very well tested, most of the time was spent in the tests.
* There is one unfortunate god method that could stand to be refactored.
* Some bugs/errors in the shooting logic.
* Be careful about accessor use, and what objects you really need to instantiate.
* Project was incomplete, but was headed in a direction of success. Significant
time was spent on testing, and they were well written.

###### Scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
2. Enumerable & Collections: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. REPL Interface: 2

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

###### Description:

A simple HTTP server that responded dynamically to GET and POST requests.
The primary goal of the project was to understand the basics of HTTP as
well has effectively design a larger object-oriented program.

### Giving Feedback

**Feedback for Erin**
Erin has an excellent attitude and brings a fun energy to programming.  Over the last few weeks she has shown that she is determined and committed to her work. Many times I found that Erin, Karina and I were the only 1603 students still in the building on nights and weekends. In the beginning she had a tendency to get flustered with hard problems, but has shown strong development and now approaches problems with confidence. Erin's light-hearted personality makes he enjoyable to work with, making the struggle of learning software development fun.


**Feedback for Ryan:**
Ryan has been great partner during 1603, someone who is eager to help his peers solve their coding problems. One memorable time during the chaos of week 1, Ryan was willing to stay late at school and whiteboard out the structure for Mastermind with me. Ryan's strong technical skills were extremely valuable during the HTTP project. One criticism would be to make sure to slow down at the beginning of each project and consider understanding the problem well before diving into the code. With HTTP, I noticed that once we figured out the design, the project was much more manageable.

**Feedback for Robbie:**
Robbie has been a great resource and pairing partner during module one. He has sharp technical skills and an great attitude that makes him pleasure to work with.  Each time we coded together we got into a good flow and worked effectively as as unit to solve a problem. We also came up with some pretty dope methods.  Robbie’s approachable personality and genuine desire to help you understand problems conceptually make him an excellent person to help solve those juicy coding problems. I look forward to working with Robbie in the next module.

**Feedback for Karina**
Karina's curiosity and eagerness to learn makes her a really enjoyable person to be around. Her technical skills have improved dramatically over the last 6 weeks, and now shows strong command with Ruby.  She’s very committed to her work and has been visibly active at Turing outside of core hours. She noticeably has put in many hours in the basement on nights and weekends. Her passion for technology is contagious and I’ve really enjoyed our conversations about writing poetry with code and Artificial Intelligence.


### Being a Community Member

**Feedback from Erin:**
Brian has been a wonderful person to get to know over the last 6 weeks. Not only is he a sharp programmer, he is also supportive, encouraging, and willing to help. I consistently saw Brian working long hours, often carrying the weight of his project team, and making sure that he was creating the best product he could. He also gave many hours of his time to help me and many others debug and problem solve. I look forward to working with Brian more at Turing and have no doubt he will go far!

**Feedback from Ryan:**
Brian really provided an excellent partner for my first group project at Turing. Coming from Echo as well, I felt we were able to mesh quickly and tackle the issues our project presented. His solid understanding of Ruby and breaking down problems resulted in fast iteration and completion of tasks. Furthermore, I can not appreciate enough his understanding of my inopportune illness. It would of been very easy to blame or spite me for it, and instead he was incredibly understanding, and worked with me so I could contribute wherever and whenever possible.

**Feedback from Robbie:**
Brian is an awesome problem solver and fun to work with. We had done code pairing sessions together, and we were always on the same page. It was easy to feel comfortable working alongside him. When he wasn’t working on his own project, I often saw him selflessly offering help to other people who seemed to be struggling. Sometimes Brian can get hung up on a bug for a long period of time. It might help him in the future if he can hone his debugging skills or find ways to change tasks to keep productivity high. Overall, Brian is a great asset to the cohort, and it would be a pleasure to work with Brian again, to say the least.

**Feedback from Lin:**
Brian is a leader in the classroom and an inspiration to others.  He has a proven analytical & problem-solving mindset, a genuine interest in technology, and strong communication style that will allow him to excel as a software engineering team member or team lead.  In spite of any hurdles thrown in his path, Brian's enthusiasm to move forward is contagious and truly inspiring for others and myself.  Instead of jumping into a solution, Brian thoughtfully plans out what he needs to do by diagramming, talking through the details, and always advocates for test-driven development. My only advice would be to give yourself longer breaks when tackling a difficult problem, and to practice typing the word "repository." I hope to see Brian continue being a leader in Turing because it's a gift to the school and community.
