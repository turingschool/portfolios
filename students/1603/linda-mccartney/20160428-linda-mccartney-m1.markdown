# Lin McCartney- M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came here to develop the skills required to become a junior web developer.  I've learned the fundamentals of the ruby programming language, object-oriented programming, and git workflow.

### End of Module Assessment

TBD
### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcmccartney/enigma.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/enigma)

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Generally code was clean.
* 7 tests, make sure youre running all the tests after adding code.
* Would like to have seen some more edge cases.
* Watch out for unnecessary use of attr_accessor and of unnecessary variables.
* missing iterations 3+

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Enigma

Additional Feature: Chunks of Six

Notes:

* Encrypt/decrypt/chunks of six --- did not complete crack

##### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2.5: Application is missing one of the three operations

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Team

### Projects

* Hyde
* Black Thursday

### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/lcmccartney/hyde)
* [Original Assignment]( https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Notes:

17 tests all pass
Would like to have seen a little more in depth testing, testing for content as well as existance.
91 percent test coverage.
Some opportunities to refactor with longer methods.
Overall code was clear and easy to follow.
Think about how you can pull out unnecessary variable assignment to separate methods.

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


### Black Thursday

  * [GitHub URL](http://github.com/lcmccartney/hyde)
  * [Original Assignment]( https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

  Notes:
  * spec harnes passes 45 seconds
  * 104 tests,99.58 percent converage
  * Overall well written project.
  * Good code orgnaization using classes and modules where appropriate.
  * Sales Analyst has a bit of overuse of instance variables.
  * Some opportunities to refactor, not a huge amount.


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation

  The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Jennifer Soden:
Jenny has been the most helpful and supportive person to me in the cohort.  I felt like I could go to her when I needed to ask a question or needed advice in general.  I am a person who has always relied on myself and have always been reluctant to seek assistance from others, however Jenny’s willingness to help is an inspiration to me, and I hope I can reciprocate that in the future, and also provide the same level support for others who are in doubt.  My only advice is to keep on coding for fun, and to not let a difficult problem/concept keep you from trying to conquer the issue. Keep being you because you are seriously amazing!

To Brian Sayler:
Brian is a leader in the classroom and an inspiration to others.  He has a proven analytical & problem-solving mindset, a genuine interest in technology, and strong communication style that will allow him to excel as a software engineering team member or team lead.  In spite of any hurdles thrown in his path, Brian's enthusiasm to move forward is contagious and truly inspiring for others and myself.  Instead of jumping into a solution, Brian thoughtfully plans out what he needs to do by diagramming, talking through the details, and always advocates for test-driven development. My only advice would be to give yourself longer breaks when tackling a difficult problem, and to practice typing the word "repository." I hope to see Brian continue being a leader in Turing because it's a gift to the school and community.

### Being a Community Member

Lin, I really enjoyed working with you on Hyde. I feel like it was a good learning experience for both of us. I think you did a really good job with the project and you never quit working on it. Your sheer determination of will is inspiring. I feel like you could use just more practice coding because you have a good tactic of how to get it done but sometimes have confusion on execution, but that just comes with doing more projects. I think if you keep coding, you’ll do really well. And you were able to figure out ERB which is still magic to me. Keep at it, I believe you will do fantastic things.

### Playing a Part

I've offered support to the community by:
* Diligently fulfilled cleaning duties every week
* Offered emotional support to cohort members and students in higher modules
* Promoted recycling and environmental betterment
* Participated in all community events including Gear Ups, Lunch Roulette, Lightning Talks, Electives

## Review

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

#### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

#### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

#### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.

#### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

#### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
