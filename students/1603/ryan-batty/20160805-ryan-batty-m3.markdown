# Ryan Batty - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Two modules down, two to go! With Module 3, I knew I wanted to tackle things a little bit differently than with previous modules. Unlike Module 1 or 2, Module 3 presented a unique opportunity to focus on challenging myself and really showing what I was capable of, as the majority of what we learned was already covered in the previous modules.

In simplest terms, I felt Module 3 was a capstone to the Ruby/Rails portion of Turing, and that I had to push myself as hard as possible to show what I accomplished in the total of 18 weeks.

Overall, I feel this was a very successful endeavor. Early on I experienced some challenges with TDD coverage and execution on the Pivot, but I believe I proved that was more the exception than the rule on later assignments. Furthermore, I used my personal project as a way to show I could learn something completely new in a very short time period which, while incredibly stressful, ended up a success and I can now add asynchronous API usage, React Native, Android App Production, and other related skills to my toolbelt.

Without a doubt, Module 3 is one of the hardest things I've done, not just at Turing, but in my whole life. By the end long nights and frustration become very common, but I feel the payoff was worth it, and I have nothing but fond memories.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Josh

Notes:
* Testing is great, very detailed. Hitting unit and feature tests.
* API destroy call in postman failing due to no :null_session used in the api base controller
* Interested in why you chose #search_handler in application controller.
* Nice to see apiKey and format added in initialize instead of repeating in methods
* Good job breaking out result, search and store in order to keep division, smaller methods and keeping hashes out of views
* Could have named variables (hashed_result) and result class better
* Routes are restful
* Views are really clean. Like the use of each_with_index to get specific ids for each store
* Overall, great job

### Personal Projects

### Mini Minion
Assessed By: Nate

github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/mini_minion](https://github.com/Riizu/mini_minion)

Notes:
- Didn't get any styling done
- You know more than I do about react at this point. Let alone react native.
- Great rails tests. Good luck with client testing in the future.
- Ignore your cassettes
- We teach VCR, but take a look at webmock by itself. It's a lot more flexible for testing edge cases.

### Group Projects

#### The Pivot

Group Members:

Notes:

- Some UI things. Not really polished enough. Flash messages got swallowed. Some unintuitive redirects.
- Long conversation about testing. Coverage helps you find the things you're missing. The tests you've written provide good value for the things they're testing. TDD feels unnatural for you, so keep experimenting. Find your inner TDD.
- Could use scopes. Active is the only reasonable default scope, but listen to whatever your boss tells you.
- Look into decorators if you like. Josh likes Presenters.

### Rails Engine

Assessed By:

Group Members:
- Ryan Batty
- Anna Weisbrodt

github_repo: [https://github.com/AnnaCW/rails_engine](https://github.com/AnnaCW/rails_engine)

Notes:

* Really solid ActiveRecord
* Some repetition with functionality. Could clean it up using ActiveRecord's `.merge(Model.some_method)` and by moving the formatting done in Ruby to modules.
* Tests were written really well and had a great balance of clarity. Used factories in a way that took advantage of making things maintainable without hiding too much.

### Received Feedback

#### Charles Kaminer - The Pivot

Second project down, Ryan. This was my first experience working for someone the second time and I think I learned a lot from it. After working on Rush Hour together I felt as if we both had a much smoother work flow on the pivot from the start. As always, your git knowledge and organization made the process of working in a group much easier than it potentially could be. Just like our last time working together I really appreciate your ability to have a thorough discussion about general project direction. Your balance of technical ability and patience makes it an enjoyable process when we need to talk through things. I know you focused a lot on leadership during this project and I think you've made some pretty great strides. I think as we talked about during our re-DTR, you sometimes will say things like "we will" or "we are going to do this" which can make team members feel like they're being told what to do on their own project. I know you're work style after working on two projects and I know that you don't mean it to come off that way so it doesn't affect me. I do however think it's something worth making an effort to work on. A big part of leading on these projects is keeping in mind that we are all peers working towards a common goal. Some people can react differently to feeling like they're being told what to do, so I think that would help you greatly. I really appreciate your efforts to always keep things moving and I like working with you. I think making some efforts towards giving more thought to the you phrase things will make huge gains in your leadership ability. You do great work, dude. Keep on crushing.

#### Anna Weisbrodt - Rails Engine

I'm really happy with our final Rails Engine product, and I learned a lot in the process. I think we work well together, and I very much appreciate the constant and open communication we had in person and via Slack. Thanks also for your diligent use of Waffle, and for teaching me some new Github skills! I know I gave you some group-dynamics-type feedback when we worked together in the past. My impression is that you have acted on the feedback you have received, which is awesome. My only real comment in the 'constructive' category is that you seemed a bit quick to defend/explain during the eval. I always have that impulse too, so I understand. I hope mod 3 is wrapping up on a very positive note for you. Keep up the good work!

### Giving Feedback

#### Jenny Soden - The Pivot
My one fellow Star Wars fan! With the exception of my ability to remember your preferred name the majority of the time, I think our group experience was very positive. I really appreciated how forthcoming you were when it came to feedback on ideas and issues, and the fact that you were always willing to chime in when necessary. That said, I do wish that you weren't quite so quick to lean towards the "Glass Half Full" mentality. While useful to keep things in perspective, sometimes it comes off as a lack of faith in the group, which can be trying. As you move forward, perhaps try looking for successes you can really rally behind and champion the group's progress.

#### Anna Weisbrodt - Rails Engine
Well I have to say Anna, after working with you a second time, I think we make an amazing team. You're consistently supportive and a team player. Overall, we just get along really well. Looking forward to ways to improve, I'm not really sure. I feel your team skills are fantastic, as are your technical abilities. Continue to hone and improve these going forward, and I think you'll become an amazing developer. Thanks for the great team dynamic and experience on Rails Engine.

## Community Involvement

### Miyamoto Posse Activities

  During Module 3 I took over leadership duties for the Miyamoto Posse. One of my primary goals when doing this was to transition from the more passive/"learn on your own" style the posse previously had and instead take a more active instructive path.


  This ended up being a wildly successful endeavor. Over the six weeks of module 4 we had four seperate student-led sessions and four after-school hour-long meetings/classes. We tackled learning the basics of Unity as a group (using the official docs as reference), discussing the needs of a Minimum Viable Product as it pertains to game development, and how to brainstorm and then dissect a game idea down into its core part to be used in the aforementioned MVP.

  This time around I also had considerable help from Parker Phillips, who was a constant boost in morale and helped us grow the posse from two people up to a total of over ten new sign ups and about six concurrent members.
