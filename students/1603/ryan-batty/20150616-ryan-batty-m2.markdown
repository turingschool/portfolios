### Areas of Emphasis

After finishing Module 1, I knew I had two major goals going into module 2. The first was to develop a strong comfort level in Rails, and really understand how a Rails app worked. The second, to continue to firm up my ability to work in a group, as I have grown to realize how essential of a skill that can be when developing.


After finishing module 2, I feel like I have accomplished the above tasks, though I did discover a third area of emphasis halfway through. Unlike module 1 where deadlines define your success, much of module 2 is far more personally accountable, which really became a stumbling block for me after relying on the structure of module 1. Learning when its appropriate to take time for yourself and balance it with your personal commitments has proven to be an interesting challenge, but one that I am thankful to grow because of.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

Notes:
* Went very smoothly
* Seem very comfortable with various rails tools, good grasp of when each is need -- when to use a route, when do i need
to change a controller, when do i need to put something in the db, etc etc
* Still making good use of enums when needed
* Workflow, tools, using test, using console are all good
* Good sense of where to put various bits of logic in order to keep it out of the view/controller/etc

### Personal Projects

### Robot World
github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/robot_world](https://github.com/Riizu/robot_world)

Coming into Mod 2, Robot World was the first real assignment I felt like I could stretch my limits with and try and get comfortable with Sinatra. I enjoyed the challenge of adding additional features while implementing the defaults, especially a custom "Generate Avatar" button for each individual robot.

### ToolChest
github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/tool_chest](https://github.com/Riizu/tool_chest)

The benefit to Tool Chest I think was that it was a project we consistently updated during class. That said, I think that purpose got muddled with the number of additional repos we cloned for individual lessons, and it eventually became hard to figure out what to update, and what not to.

### MixMaster
github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/mix_master](https://github.com/Riizu/mix_master)

MixMaster provided an excellent starting point into Rails, and all the possibilities available within. I especially enjoyed the Spotify integration. I think the only thing I would of preferred is if it went a bit faster.

#### Mini Project - WarPath
github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/warpath](https://github.com/Riizu/warpath)

The Mini Project was definitely my favorite assignment of the module. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't self-decided, and really liked being able to come up with my own tasks and features. What I did learn though, was proper scoping of time with current ability levels. I was unable to complete what I had hoped, but I really felt like I accomplished my goal, which was to firm up my understanding of more complex database schemas, with the final product intended to have about 9 tables, including Many to Many, One to Many, Polymorphic, and possibly Self-Referential relationships.

During the peer discussion, I played around with SendGrid, a gem for server statistics, and another gem for a better Rails error page.

### Group Projects

#### Rush Hour

Assessed By: Jeff

github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/rush-hour](https://github.com/Riizu/rush-hour)

Notes:
* write at least 2 tests for each error code - test each error code in different ways
* watch for subtle naming problems (create_payload v. create payload and client)
* if you get a detailed spec, think about the right things AND all the ways things could go wrong
* be more detailed, specific when displaying data such as most frequent request types - be clearer with labeling, and show percentages, for example, rather than just a list
* limit DB queries - access DB once, then manipulate the data
* TDD: tests should be a little more advanced, more coverage
* consistency in formatting (!client vs. existance == false)
* long if/else statements: first pull out any long code within so that you can see what is going on within if/else - whether some are really the same, etc.
* create a payload build method so that the setup can be changed easily if you find a better way to create payload

### Little Shop

Assessed By: Jhun

github_repo: [https://github.com/Riizu/hiptique](https://github.com/Riizu/hiptique)

Notes:
* great test coverage
* tests are granular and scoped to specific html ids and classes which I like a lot.
* Model test test validations and attempts to create without required validations.
* All the views. I mean all of them had a partial. I like that.
* great pull request conversations about code
* Models are strong with a little more effort could hit the 4 mark easily

### Received Feedback

**Anna Weisbrodt:**

Your merge conflict resolution skills are impressive! I hope I can pick up some of that during the project. I also appreciate your willingness to explain things. Usually this is great; occasionally it comes across as a little patronizing. This is something that ruffles my feathers more than it should, so this is partly my issue. I know we’ve had some minor tense moments, but overall I think we’ve resolved them in a positive way. Yesterday, for example, we had a tense moment, then both backed off, but ultimately came back to the issue, expressed our thoughts, and arrived at a solution better than either of the original alternatives. Along the same lines, I really appreciate that we can have exchanges like this and you don't seem to take it personally — I certainly don’t. I think we’re on track for a very successful Rush Hour, so cheers to that!

**Charles Kaminer:**

The legend of Batty!  Your general programming knowledge is quite extensive which has been a true asset to our team. On top of that, you have really held us to a high standard of git workflow which I really really appreciate as I have much to learn.  I think if you could try to harness your knowledge and maybe slow it down that would be super helpful. When there are debugging issues you are a wizard at figuring them out but sometimes mash away at the keyboard and I get kind of lost.  I understand that during the debugging process sometimes that is what needs to be done but a quick check after the problem is fixed would really help me out for when I'm working on something down the road.  I have a lot to learn so working with you has already taught me a lot.  Let's keep making meaningful progress on this thing and put together a killer final project!

**Colin Osborn:**

Ryan, I’ve only worked with you briefly for pairings, but it’s always been really good. You’re extremely knowledgable, smart and enthusiastic about programming and software development. These are awesome traits that, and make you a excellent resource for questions or issues. I can’t even remember how many times I’ve used you as a resource, and thank you for that. I think at times, some of your input is very useful, but may just need to be a bit rephrased(?) I know you’re a great guy with good intentions and never mean to rub people the wrong way, and you do have very valid inputs, so please don’t stop sharing your thoughts or feedback. Also don’t sell yourself short, you’re a good, funny person who I like talking to and excited to work with you on a project. I’d encourage you to share that fun and funny side more often and feel comfortable around everyone here. Thanks for being a part of the cohort!

**Ilana Corson:**

Ryan has been a very effective member of our Little Shop team. From go, he was able to take on any of the tasks that were assigned to him with excitement. Ryan has a depth of knowledge about computer programming that most might never have and he is always willing to share that knowledge as well. When personality conflicts arose, Ryan was able to adapt well to the constructive criticism that he received. In addition to taking on all the tasks that were assigned to him, he would also jump in at any time to help if there were bugs or other snags. I would like to have Ryan on my team in the professional world because he would be a great asset. He is able to help direct the project but also can step back.

**Erin Greenhalgh:**

Ryan is a strong programmer whose tenacity and curiosity for problem solving I really admire. He is always willing to fiddle with a bug, research, and read docs to find a solution. At times, Ryan's explanations of code to other teammates can sound a bit forceful and didactic rather than a mutual discussion of code. That being said, Ryan cares deeply about having a good group experience and making a strong product.

### Giving Feedback

**Anna Weisbrodt:**

So far, working with Anna has been very humbling. Often times I find myself being consistantly questioned and pushed to challenge my own thinking, which when tensions are high can be frustrating, but when I reflect back I am always thankful for it. Over the last few days I have experienced more moments of, "Oh, I didn't know that, thank you!" than I have ever had at Turing, and I feel I have Anna to  thank for that.

Outside of academic challenges, working together has been pleasant. Both of us seem to be aware of the other's mood at a given moment, and in general know when to give space, or when to enthusiastically push each other to reach that finish line in our own way. I would definitely work together again, and welcome the lessons that I'd surely learn from the experience.

**Charles Kaminer:**

Having the opportunity to work with Charlie has been extremely beneficial in terms of seeing the way others approach an issue, both when I approach it in the same way and when I don't. Whenever Charlie and I share a thought or success its often followed up by high fives and support, which makes for a great work environment. On the other hand, even if we don't agree its still a civil and pleasant discussion to figure it out, rather than a high-tensioned argument.

Overall, I feel Charlie is very successful at figuring out what's needed to get a job done. Whether it's planning out how to spend our time as a group or how to approach a problem, he always maintains a level head and positive attitude. This results in overall higher morale for the whole group, and we continue to make progress on the project.

**Colin Osborn:**

Since the start of Turing, I have not had many opportunities to work with Colin, with the exception of a number of in-class assignments. Regardless, any time we work together, discuss trials and tribulations of Turing, or just chat, I have always enjoyed the discussion. He seems knowledgable,very friendly and approachable. I think perhaps his biggest stumbling block is confidence in his skills, as a number times during the assignments we paired on, he had the answer, and convinced himself he didn't.

**Ilana Corson:**

When I first was paired with Ilana for Little Shop, I knew I was in for a surprise. We had not chatted much or really ever worked together. That said, from the get go we immediately put that behind us, had an excellent DTR, and I think really established what we needed to be successful. Her constant positive attitude, concern, and caring for our success proved to be a huge benefit to the group. I think that when Ilana feels confident and assured of her abilities, she can accomplish anything, but when she loses that confidence, it can be hard for her to progress. I know though that this will pass, and saw as much towards the end of our project, as she immediately took on more work the moment her successful personal assessment confirmed her abilities.

Overall, I'd be happy to work together again with her, and I know that she will become a very passionate, competent developer.


**Erin Greenhalgh:**

I think the best thing about working with Erin is her nigh-unfaltering positivity. Every time we spoke, whether it was over a success or failure, was positive. She never once let her frustrations or personal issues negatively impact the project, and it was nice to know that she was someone our group could strongly rely on. If I had to pick one criticism, it would be that sometimes discussion on a given topic can become very cyclical or unfocused. I think this is a result of experience though, and as her understanding of the topics become more cemented, she will correct herself less. This also could be a result of our differing approaches to a problem, and her more methodical method could be a better balance to my personal action-oriented one. Regardless, I know her attitude is something I personally admire, and hope to emulate in the future.

### Being a Community Member

During the course of module 2, I endeavored to increase my personal involvement towards the betterment of Turing and its community. I ran a student-led session on customizing the terminal, assisted another in application shortcuts, and gave a lightning talk on Application Security, which has led to interest in a penetration testing posse.

I do wish that I had been more active in the posse I originally chose though, and look forward to improving that in module 3.
