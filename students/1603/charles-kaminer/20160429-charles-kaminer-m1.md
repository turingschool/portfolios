### Areas of Emphasis

There is a page in my notebook dated 3/21/16 (my first day at Turing) where I list three main bullet points as my areas of emphasis for module one.  The first two sounded difficult at the time but I now make me laugh inside at the fact that they were once legitimate goals.  Number one, I wanted "to become more comfortable with programming lingo".  Ultimately I wanted to be able to increase my ability to express problems when asking for help as well as effectively communicate solutions if I found myself offering help to someone else.  Second on my list was to be able to explain to my girlfriend, parents, friends, etc. what object-oriented programming is.  I can comfortably say that I have accomplished both of these goals.  I have had countless conversations over the past six weeks that have required me to use proper programming lingo in order to discuss problems.  In regards to explaining OOP, I tried explaining to my girlfriend, Ashlynn, how everything revolves around objects, methods, and states and am confident that she was able to at least understand the basic underlying concepts.  I consider that a win.  My final goal was to cultivate a more "creative-thinker" attitude with the hopes of being able to approach the same problems in a variety of different ways.  To me, this was the most important.  One of my main flaws coming into Turing was my tendency to figure out a solution to a problem that worked and just go with it.  Programming has taught me that your first solution is rarely the best or most efficient despite the fact that it may work.  The general concepts of refactoring and pairing have helped me greatly in my approach to problems all throughout my life.

### Work

Getting used to "the Turing way" is no easy task.  You are forced to take all preconceived ideas of academia and flip them on their head.  As somewhat of a traditionalist coming in, this was a challenge for me.  It's crazy how much I have grown to love the grind over the last six weeks.  Errors and bugs can be a pain in the you-know-what but I take pride in knowing that I now I have the tools to figure them out.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beats was our first real project of the module.  I have to say, the most gratifying moment of the module for me may have been hearing my Mac spit out that beat in a variety of voices and paces.  Conceptualizing linked lists was challenging for me and forced me to learn early on how important it is to reach out to students in other modules.  Gaining the support I needed was crucial to my success on this project.

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Start focusing more on the Single Responsibility Principle.  There are a lot of long methods that could be broken out into smaller methods.  Would make the project more concise and readable.

##### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 5. Looping or Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

The night before Enigma was due was my first 'holy shit, I am screwed' moment at Turing.  It was assigned on a Thursday and due the following Thursday.  By the end of the weekend I felt like I was in such a great place.  I had functionally made it through encrypt and decrypt and felt great.  Once it came time to implement the crack feature I hit a wall that I had not encountered up until that point.  Facing that kind of challenge was a great learning experience for me.  Enigma brought me my only 2's of the module and I hope they will be my last at  Turing.

Assessed By: Nate

Notes:

* Code is functional, mostly, but it needs to be cleaned up
* Use instance variable sparingly. If it's used in only one method, it should be a local variable
* Don't be afraid to use methods where variables would normally go
* Long tests are ok, capture the work you've done
* Don't worry about obvious tests

##### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

##### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


## Team


### Projects
We were assigned two partner projects during this module.  I worked with Pete Springer on Hyde and Nick Pisciotta on Black Thursday.


#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/hyde)

For Hyde we were assigned the task of building our own blogging platform that would allow the user to write blogs in markdown files and have them automatically converted to html with the same file structure.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* 20 tests total
* 100 percent coverage
* I liked how granular the tests were.
* Some opportunities for refactoring in pulling out conditionals to methods and pulling out long chains into methods.

##### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


"Charlie is easy to work with. He is an encouraging and patient teammate that I would be happy to work with again." - Pete


#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
* [README](https://github.com/ckaminer/black_thursday/blob/master/README.md)

For Black Thursday our goal was to build a system that could take business intelligence data (sales, transactions, etc.) from a typical e-commerce business and search it, parse it, run queries on it, etc.  I felt like everything came full circle during this project.  It was nice having the two weeks because we had ample time to refactor on the last day.  It was really cool to look back on the finished product and see the variety of tools we used (i.e. modules, advanced enums, SRP, etc.).  The contrast of the quality of work in this project and Jungle Beats gets me really fired up!

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

    - 4: Zero complaints

"Charlie's strong understanding of programming and grasp of the material was evident throughout our time together working on Black Thursday.  He was very communicative throughout the entirety of the project, and would take time to explain any topics I was unsure of. His focus and dedication kept us on a good time frame, and we were able to complete a solid project with very few issues along the way." - Nick

## Community

### Giving Feedback

For Pete regarding Hyde:
* "I had a great time working with Pete on hyde.  I had a couple of scheduling constraints that week and he was extremely flexible and more than willing to accommodate my schedule. We were able to make good progress every day by being on the same page and getting right down to business.  Pete was a supportive partner and always eager to solve the problems we ran into.  I would definitely work with him again."

For Nick regarding Black Thursday:
 * “It was a pleasure working on this project with Nick.  He was an attentive and encouraging partner throughout the entire process.  Nick maintained a strong commitment to working through our project piece by piece so that we didn’t ever  have to stay particularly late.  Our ability to bounce ideas off of each other and provide constructive feedback was a huge part of getting this project done in an efficient and timely manner."

### Being a Community Member

From pairing session with Lovisa:
* Good progress so far, try to focus on general code hygiene.  This should include not pushing commented out code, proper indentation, etc.
* Introduced private methods
* Helped with file i/o

General feedback from Sonia:
* "Charlie and I had a chance to pair on the robot exercise. I had gotten to know him informally before that, but this was my first time pairing with him. It was truly a pleasure! Charlie has the perfect mix of patience, perseverance, and empathy. I often had questions during the exercise, and he was kind and articulate in explaining things to me. He also made things a lot of fun. Charlie has consistently proven himself to be one of the most diligent students in 1603. I have often seen him working at school late at night. Charlie also willingly offers help to other students, but he is also incredibly humble in acknowledging gaps in his own knowledge. Overall, Charlie has been one of my favorite 1603 students. He adds an incredible amount of positive energy to the group, and to the school as a whole. I always think that whoever gets to pair with him is incredibly lucky, as he brings such positivity and excellence to his projects. And he came up with “Let’s Goooo” which is a pretty major contribution to the community."  

### Playing a Part

First things first, I made A LOT of coffee.  I have also laid the ground work to start/revive a 3D printing student group.  On a day to day basis, I have tried my best throughout the module to provide support for my 1603 peers whether that be academic or emotional.  I have always found it important in school to form a bond beyond the books with your classmates.  It makes the entire experience a lot more manageable for all parties.  I don't plan on my time at Turing being an exception to that outlook.
