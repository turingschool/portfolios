### Areas of Emphasis

I felt a variety of emotions heading into this module.  Predominantly, I was excited.  After a tough six weeks in mod 1, I was stoked about the opportunity to work on projects that I could actually see.  Despite my excitement, I was also very much aware of how different of an experience mod 2 would be.  I really had no idea how the internet worked before this module with left me a little uneasy.  My main goal before the module was to be able to explain to my mom how websites work.  I feel like I've accomplished that and would be able to walk my mom through the MVC model at a level she could understand.  From a technical standpoint, I really wanted to focus on the practice of TDD this module.  It was something I struggled with last module and knew I would need to improve on.  Now that mod 2 is over I'd definitely say I accomplished this goal.  I made it a point on all of my work to start out by writing tests.  I especially practice this with my rails mini-project which I think was very helpful going into little shop and will be on all projects moving forward.

### Work

Going from pure Ruby into Sinatra felt like a big jump at the time.  Then we got to Rails.  I'm happy to say that I am slowly believing less and less in "Rails magic" but I definitely still have a lot to learn.  I'm looking forward to continued exploration of Rails.

### Mix master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master was a large tutorial that took up the bulk of my long weekend.  It was fun to work on after only a week of learning Rails.  We had learned so much in that one week that it was exciting to get an opportunity to put some of it together.  I learned a lot about what Rails can do for you.  This was huge coming off of Sinatra.  My first instincts were still telling me to do a lot of things that Rails automatically takes care of.  This was a big thing for as it made me a lot more comfortable in Rails apps for the rest of the module.

I also was able to get my first experience accessing APIs when I implemented the login with Spotify feature.  Although I was walked through it step by step, it helped me immensely when it came time to set up Twitter functionality during my Little Shop project.

### Rails Mini-Project: What's Brewin

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/whats_brewin)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

I had a great time working on this mini project.  It was our first opportunity to really explore things in rails as well as get more practice on the things we felt needed improvement.  Being able to pick a project definitely contributed to my positive experience working on it as it is something I hope to continue working on in the future.  I choice to work on a project that would allow users to browse and rank craft beers that were sorted by style and brewery.

For this project I really wanted to focus on my routing and logic placement (asset pipeline).  I spent a bulk of my time working on admin functionality which allowed me to get very familiar with nested routes and authorization.  For my extension I worked on implementing a rating system.  This gave me the chance to work on some more complicated schemas as well as setting up a rating implementation in the views.  This was a rewarding project for me and I hope to continue working on it.


## Team

### Projects
We were assigned two group projects during this module.  I worked with Anna Weisbrodt and Ryan Batty on Rush Hour and Lucy Fox and Marcella Wigg on Little Shop.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Riizu/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was our first real project of the module.  It was an interesting experience to say the least.  It was our first web app, only Sinatra project, AND the first time we worked in groups.  All three of those things made the project challenging but I had a positive experience with my group and we were able to put together a project we were all proud of.

Assessed By: Jeff

- Notes:
  * write at least 2 tests for each error code - test each error code in different ways
  * watch for subtle naming problems (create_payload v. create payload and client)
  * if you get a detailed spec, think about the right things AND all the ways things could go wrong
  * be more detailed, specific when displaying data such as most frequent request types - be clearer with labeling, and show percentages, for example, rather than just a list
  * limit DB queries - access DB once, then manipulate the data
  * TDD: tests should be a little more advanced, more coverage
  * consistency in formatting (!client vs. existance == false)
  * long if/else statements: first pull out any long code within so that you can see what is going on within if/else - whether some are really the same, etc.
  * create a payload build method so that the setup can be changed easily if you find a better way to create payload

  ##### 1. Functional Expectations

  * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

  ##### 2. Test-Driven Development

  * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

  ##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

  ##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

  ##### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

  * 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

  ##### 6. View Layer

  * 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

"Charlie - I’ve really enjoyed working with you so far. I appreciate your willingness to dive into the Active Record docs, and your efficiency in finding what we need. You mentioned during DTR that you’re working on not snapping / making nasty comments when things get tense. (Not your wording, but it was something along those lines). I wouldn't have identified that as something you need to work on, so you seem to be doing an excellent job — and I know how hard that can be because I’m working on the same thing. I hope you’re not holding back if you see a better way of doing things, but there was really only one time when I felt like that may have been happening. Finally, you’re great at pointing out mistakes in a really kind, helpful way." - Anna

"Having the opportunity to work with Charlie has been extremely beneficial in terms of seeing the way others approach an issue, both when I approach it in the same way and when I don't. Whenever Charlie and I share a thought or success its often followed up by high fives and support, which makes for a great work environment. On the other hand, even if we don't agree its still a civil and pleasant discussion to figure it out, rather than a high-tensioned arguement.  Overall, I feel Charlie is very successful at figuring out what's needed to get a job done. Whether it's planning out how to spend our time as a group or how to approach a problem, he always maintains a level head and positive attitude. This results in overall higher morale for the whole group, and we continue to make progress on the project." - Ryan

#### Little Shop - Socks and Found

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lucyfox4131/socks_and_found)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

- Notes:
 * Background image: make a div that comes after the body and make the id background image and place the image in there instead of having to use the body. Isolate the image outside of just the body tag.
 * Make sure there is seed data for everything so you can see things in production. (Orders should have seed data).
 * Make sure that the helper methods in controller are private methods
 * Simple delegator - super the item, creates an object that is aware of it's quantity, sum, and all the item attributes (could have used this as an extra helper for cart items maybe)
 * Dry up testing by creating a helper method for creating an admin so you'll have to declare it less.
 * Good to have complete model testing
 * Good job testing at feature and model level, make sure method works and make sure feature works as well
 * Workflow: Glimpses of excellent, but would like to see more commenting on github, I have specific feedback for you at this line. Majority of things squashed, but could have done a few more.
​
 #### 1. Feature Completeness
​
 * 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
​
 #### 2. Views
​
 * 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
​
 #### 3. Controllers
​
 * 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
​
 #### 4. Models
​
 * 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
​
 #### 5. Testing
​
 * 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
​
 #### 6. Usability
​
 * 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
​
 #### 7. Workflow
​
 * 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Giving Feedback

For Anna regarding Rush Hour:
* "You have been an awesome team member during this project.  I think a huge part of that has to do with our effective DTR. I think you're very results-driven which I like.  It keeps things moving and helps give me an idea of what direction you would like to go in.  I think on the flip side, that can cause you to want to move on to the next thing a little fast.  In certain cases (especially early in the project when we are not under the gun as much) it can be beneficial to the project (for learning purposes and just better code) to take a second to consider other solutions that might work better.  I really appreciate your dedication to the project and keeping us on time.  I'm excited to see our final product. I think it's gonna be a good one!"

For Ryan regarding Rush Hour:
 * “The legend of Batty!  Your general programming knowledge is quite extensive which has been a true asset to our team.  On top of that, you have really held us to a high standard of git workflow which I really really appreciate as I have much to learn.  I think if you could try to harness your knowledge and maybe slow it down that would be super helpful. When there are debugging issues you are a wizard at figuring them out but sometimes mash away at the keyboard and I get kind of lost.  I understand that during the debugging process sometimes that is what needs to be done but a quick check after the problem is fixed would really help me out for when I'm working on something down the road.  I have a lot to learn so working with you has already taught me a lot.  Let's keep making meaningful progress on this thing and put together a killer final product!"

For Marcella regarding Little Shop:
  * “I had a blast working with Marcella on Little Shop.  We had not had the chance to work together before this and I'm very glad I got the opportunity.  Marcella was a very caring partner and was very conscientious of our group's global and individual needs.  As a project manager, she was great about keeping us on track and organized.  I think going forward Marcella could benefit from being a bit more vocal during the development process.  Early on, when framing a project, I felt at times like she may have held back on what I'm sure were good ideas.  I think even if an idea doesn't end up getting executed it is still beneficial to talk through why or why not you might not use it.  Overall Marcella was a great team member who was always willing to work on whatever the team needed.  I learned a lot from her throughout the entire two weeks and look forward to working with her in the future."

For Lucy regarding Little Shop:
  * “Working with Lucy on Little Shop has been a pleasure.  I really admire her general work ethic and drive.  She has been instrumental in keeping things moving on a day to day basis.  Our group has had an easy time working together which I really appreciate.  Two week projects are a lot of work and it meant a lot to me to have two group mates who were so dedicated to turning in a good product while also maintaining respect and good relations with their partners.  I think sometimes it was tough for Lucy to not move forward at a quicker pace which may have caused some frustration.  It can be tough to move at a slower pace than you are typically used to and I think she was great about catching herself wanting to move ahead and respecting our pace.  I was able to learn a lot from Lucy thanks to her extensive  knowledge and willingness to put in time to help explain things.  I think we turned in a great project and I look forward to working with Lucy in the future."

### Community Content
During this module I had the opportunity to run a student lead session with Brian Sayler on 3D printing.  I wanted to work with the 3D printer for a while so I was excited at this opportunity to learn a new skill and share my knowledge with other students.  Brian and I spent a few days familiarizing ourselves with the printer before leading a group of roughly 10-15 students through the process of printing.  We centered our session around proper set up techniques including how to ready the image on your computer and how to set up the printer (i.e. change the color, heat up, cool down, etc.).  As a class we printed a Pikachu with trumps head, called Trumpachu.

### Blog Post
My blog post this module is on the relevance and usefulness of the authorization gem, BCrypt.  This includes the who, what, why's of BCrypt such as why we use and what sets it apart from other authorization gems.

### Playing a Part

This module I did my best to contribute to the community in as many ways as I could.  I signed up to be a micro-posse leader which admittedly, could have gone better.  We didn't have a rigid meeting schedule and kind of died down half way through the module when the mod 1 students had gotten their feet wet.  We paired a good amount the first few weeks and it definitely allowed me to make connections with students early which hopefully made them comfortable reaching out to me for help in the future.  On top of that I also signed up for weekly pairing sessions as mod 2's way of paying it forward to mod 1.  Last mod, we had weekly pairing sessions with 1602 which I found to be very helpful and wanted to carry on this tradition.  Again, I also made a ton of coffee.  This module it was important to me that our cohort came together outside of school.  After dropping down to 15 students I felt as if there was a general feeling of "walking on eggshells".  I think as a whole, we accomplished that goal and became much closer this module and I look forward to becoming even closer over the next two mods.
