### Areas of Emphasis

This module I had a number of learning goals. The primary was of course to become familiar with object oriented programming, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. The secondary goals (or perhaps supporting goals) were to practice resilience and grit and to do away with crippling notions of perfectionism. I knew coming in that the process of programming, with its inherent road blocks, errors, and frustrations, would be a new challenge for me, who prefers to fully comprehend something and manage details cleanly at all times. My biggest effort and greatest challenge was to adopt a more flexible, less flappable approach to problems-solving. Though I know that this is something I will continue to work on throughout my time at Turing and beyond, I have made great strides during this module and am proud of the determination I showed. Despite some less-than optimal project scores, I feel I have earnestly devoted myself to my work and my learning and am proud of the work I have done.

### End of Module Assessment

Got a passing score but need to get the breakdown of scores from Mike. 

## Work

The projects below are my individual projects from this module.

### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Purpose: Build a program that plays a jungly-sounding chant utilizing a linked-list structure.

Jungle Beats was the first project for Foxtrot and an introduction to creating multiple classes
that communicate with each other. It was also a conceptual puzzle to understand the structure and
behavior of the linked list. It was a challenging project but satisfying to have finished it and
accomplished my first project at Turing.


####Notes from eval with Mike:
* 26 tests total, all passing. Some more edge cases would be nice.
* well written code, some small areas can be refactored/remove unnecessary assignment of variables.
* Loved the handling of an error case and the fact that it was tested.
* defaulted to use of attr_reader instead of attr_accessor

Overall, Mike sad that my project was one of his favorites that he had evaluated.

####Project Scores
* Functional expectations: 3
* Test-driven development: 3
* Encapsulation / breaking logic into components: 4
* Fundamental ruby and style: 3
* Looping or recursion: 3

####Feedback from peers:
**Luigi Aversano:**
"Erin was a part of a group of us 1603 students that was working on Jungle Beats late at night before it was due. Erin did a great job of explaining certain concepts in the program as well as the overall flow of TDD. She was patient and stayed later than she needed to just to ensure that everyone in the group completed the project and felt comfortable with the work. She is a great team player."

## Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Purpose: Build an encryption program modeled after the Nazi enigma machine.

Enigma was the second individual project for Foxtrot and an exercise in working with more classes, using enumerables,
and file IO. This project felt like a considerable step up from Jungle Beats, and my biggest struggle was balancing adhering to
the spec while creating maintainable code. My engima class got fairly large, which made it harder for me to keep things
organized as I created more methods. I was able to finish encrypt and decrypt functionality but did not finish the crack method in time.

####Notes from eval with Nate:
* Enigma class is getting kinda full. Consider breaking things out into other classes
* You're able to speak to all your decisions, and that's a good thing, but ask for input in grey areas
* Good tests. Well named, good break down of functionality.
* Naming in general is good, but some places where you could be more explicit
* Focus on functionality is good, although some functionality is missing
* Find the balance between getting it functional and making it maintainable

####Project Scores:
* Overall functionality: 2
* Fundamental ruby and style: 3
* Test-driven development: 3
* Breaking logic into components: 3


## Team

### Projects
The projects below are my team projects for this module.

### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Purpose: Build a server that accepts requests and sends responses.

HTTP was certainly the most challenging project for me during Mod 1. There were a lot of problems in the project that all felt large and overwhelming. It was our first partner project, so we needed to get the hang of using git together and working on branches. It was my first
exposure to the mechanics of how servers work. It was a puzzle to figure out how to run tests while the server was running and to find a way to
create unit tests that ran independent of the server for some functionality. In addition, my partner and I were on quite different skill levels
during this project, so I ended up needing to carry most of the weight of working on this project on my own. We were not able to finish the base functionality needed to get a 3 in that category, but I do feel proud of the work we accomplished in the face of so many problems. The challenges with testing helped me learn how to isolate parts of a system and work with test data, versus testing full integrated functionality every time. I also feel significantly improved my understanding of how to break things into smaller classes and objects that have a single responsibility. For me this was a significant conceptual improvement from my work on Enigma.

####Notes from eval with Tess:
* Got through iteration 3. The code was well written up to that point.
* A 2 for testing because the word search functionality wasn't tested in the server test.

####Project scores:
* Overall functionality: 2
* Fundamental ruby and style: 3
* Test-driven development: 2
* Breaking logic into components: 3

####Feedback from peers:
**Lane Winham:**
"Erin was a strong partner to have on our first pair project. Starting out we were able to work towards a common goal and shoot ideas off each other easily. After a few days had passed the dynamic between us and our workflow had altered due to my perceived lack in technical skill. During this shift in dynamic, Erin did such a wonderful job of including me in her thought process and presenting the code to me in a way that I could follow while we moved forward. She was very attentive and patient with me throughout the entire partnership. Erin demonstrated that she has a good understanding of ruby fundamentals but beyond that she demonstrated how adaptive and well rounded she is as a partner. Best of all the stress of the assignment never compromised her bubbly eager attitude!"

**Kris Sparks:**
"During the HTTP project, Erin expressed concern about her overall progress. I noticed that as she worked she was writing tests as well as writing code. I also noticed that, as compared with other students, she spent proportionately less time soliciting advice and more time grinding through each iteration of the project. At each increment she had a solid understanding of the concepts and goals of the project. Erin was able to articulate what she wanted to accomplish as she worked to implement it. Her independent progress, use of TTD and ability to work through the project logically was notable and stood out among our peers.

Erin is patient, kind and willing to answer questions and help other students.  She actively participates in class and asks adept questions. Erin's significant, observable progress throughout the module has been obvious."

### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [DRT memo](https://github.com/karinamzalez/headcount/blob/master/dtr.txt)
* [README] (https://github.com/karinamzalez/headcount/blob/master/README.md)

Purpose: Build a database/analyst that will take in school-district related data, parse it, and

This culminating project for Mod 1 was as hard as everyone warned it would be, but I probably enjoyed it the most despite many hours of frustration along the way. Many concepts that I have been working on over the mod started to crystalize, especially the art of breaking components up into single-responsibility classes and earnestly using tests to drive development. We worked hard to write tests that isolated the problem into its smallest components which helped us learn what methods we needed and also what exactly was going wrong when things broke. This project was entirely an exercise in patience and persistence. Especially when it came to dealing with tangles of hashes, we constantly practiced breaking the problem into small and smaller manageable pieces, working from clear output to clear input for each piece again and again. We spent countless hours just dealing with hashes alone, but I am proud of the work we did to find elegant methods and enumerables to organize things the way we needed them. Through this project I have become more disciplined and patient with the problem-solving process and gained even more respect for the work that programmers do, work that must take into account every painstaking detail and big-picture, conceptual problems of structure.

####Notes from eval with Jhun:
 "Group shows understanding of project and code looks good. They lost a day due to a waffle problem. Horace and Mike are aware. There are solid attempts to try to move things into single responsibility methods and attempts to write solid test. I believe that if they had another day they would of been better off."

 **Other notes:**
 Jhun expressed that he saw us doing good work and moving a good direction and believes that we would have nailed the project had we not lost a day. He recognized that we were following a cascading TDD format but would have liked to see a few more edge case tests. He believes we were on the right track in terms of encapsulation and saw great glimpses in our code of truly single-responsibility and encapsulated components.

####Project Scores:
* Functionality: 2
* TDD: 3+
* Encapsulation: 3+
* Fundamental ruby and style: 3
* Enumerables: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Giving Feedback

#####Feedback for others:
**Luigi Aversano:** "During our first project at Turing, Jungle Beats, many of us worked together the night before the project to make sure we all got it done. Luigi was an affable and positive person to work with, which I really appreciated during the stress of trying to complete the project. He worked to make sure that everyone in our group completed the project, and he also offered us all a ride home after, which was a kind gesture after a long night!"

**Lane Winham:** "Though I know it was frustrating for Lane to feel like he couldn’t contribute as much on our HTTP project, I appreciated his willingness to stick it out and work through the problems as much as he could. I also really appreciated his positivity, friendliness, and flexibility. His easy-going manner and can-do attitude makes him a pleasure to work with."

**Sonia Gupta:** "Of all the people I have had the pleasure to meet in Mod 1, Sonia has stood out to me for her hard work and earnest demonstration of grit. I consistently saw Sonia working on evenings and on the weekends and diving again and again into material that was challenging and frustrating. I entirely admire her determination to push through and to put in the time to learn, and I know that this will lead her to success. In addition, Sonia’s friendliness and compassion made her a great person to have in our class."

**Brian Sayler:** "Brian has been a wonderful person to get to know over the last 6 weeks. Not only is he a sharp programmer, he is also supportive, encouraging, and willing to help. I consistently saw Brian working long hours, often carrying the weight of his project team, and making sure that he was creating the best product he could. He also gave many hours of his time to help me and many others debug and problem solve. I look forward to working with Brian more at Turing and have no doubt he will go far!"

**Karina Gonzales:** "It has been a pleasure working with Karina on Headcount. This was a daunting project, and I was impressed again and again with Karina’s even-tempered resolve to dig into a problem, learn about it, and find a solution. Karina’s programming and problem solving skills are sharp, and she knows the right questions to ask to get to the root of a problem. She is also a caring friend and sunny individual who easily makes bonds with other people in the program. I admire her dedication and her skill and look forward to working with her more in the future."

**Aaron Greenspan:** "It has been a great pleasure to work with and get to know Aaron over the last several weeks. His approach to problem solving is at once level-headed and dynamic. I admire the way he deftly breaks problems into small components in order to build an elegant solution. At multiple points Aaron helped me use this technique to make progress on projects when I had otherwise hit a dead end. Beyond his obvious technical skill, Aaron is also a compassionate and passionate teacher. He is good at engaging people, though at times he could benefit from slowing down and making sure people are fully understand the topic before moving on. Aaron easily earns the respect and friendship of his peers, and I look forward to seeing where his talents will take him!"

##Feedback for me:

**Jhun de Andres:**
"Every time I've paired with Erin there's always a huge smile on her face and she's always willing to work hard. She's bright, personable and I believe that those skills will play in her favor during her time at Turing. I am really excited to see where she goes as a developer and the tools she builds."

**Sonia Gupta:**
"It was truly a pleasure getting to know Erin this module. I admire her hard work and dedication, and the ease with which she interacts with her partners. She has an incredible amount of perseverance in the face of adversity, and I’ve noticed that she meets obstacles with an optimistic resolve to push through them--she does not capitulate. I am glad to have had the chance to get to know her and have no doubt that she will be an exceptionally successful and skillful developer!"

**Brian Sayler:**
"Erin has an excellent attitude and brings a fun energy to programming.  Over the last few weeks she has shown that she is determined and committed to her work. Many times I found that Erin, Karina and I were the only 1603 students still in the building on nights and weekends. In the beginning she had a tendency to get flustered with hard problems, but has shown strong development and now approaches problems with confidence. Erin's light-hearted personality makes her enjoyable to work with, making the struggle of learning software development fun."

**Aaron Greenspan**
"Erin takes great pride in her work.  I’ve not seen someone whiteboard and pseudo code so thoroughly, and the thrust of this effort is the design of clean, elegant, and precise code.  While the output is exceedingly clean and well made, I think part of this extended planning phase stems from a fear of making code decisions on the fly, as though a wrong decision early on will make it absolutely impossible to fix later.  This is rarely the case, and I think incorporating a bit more “reckless” coding will propel her projects further faster, and actually shed far more light on the problem at hand than thinking about it from a birds eye view."

## Playing a Part

Over these last 6 weeks I have worked hard to build sincere relationships with people in my mod and across mods. I made an effort to be at Turing as much as possible, working at school and interacting with other students whenever I had the chance. I have on multiple occasions attended meet-ups and supported Turing students who were presenting or giving talks. I consistently stayed at school until 8 or 9 every night and had the opportunity to talk with people about technical and project-related work as well as their personal lives. I helped other students in my mod with technical where I was able, and I offered support and a listening ear to those people in my mod whom I knew were struggling with various personal and Turing-related issues. While I'm still developing my technical skills, the biggest thing I can contribute is compassion and empathy to others. I know the people I have met enjoy working with me and trust me as a strong friend and team member.
