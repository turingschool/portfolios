# Colin Osborn - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

  Mod2 was a fun but challenging module.   I enjoyed the freedom in a lot of the assignments and also just how many doors Rails and even Sinatra open. While it was very enjoyable, it was also a new form of stress since it mean't even more so that there wasn't always the clear cut way to get things done or finished. I also struggled a lot in asserting myself at times, and feeling confident when working with others. While I don't think it was a great detriment in this module, it certainly didn't help and can turn into a bigger and bigger issue as I move forward not only here in Turing but into the job world. With that being said, I've already looked at taking some steps forward in the intermission week to help set me up better for Mod3 and beyond.

### Mid Module Assessment

# Pet Shop

Evaluator: Andrew

### Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

#### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 2: Developer can execute an algorithm or plan given to them

#### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

#### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 2: Developer is generally able to utilize Rails, but shows confusion or shallow knowledge about what Rails provides

#### 4. Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

#### 5. Testing

* 2: Developer struggles to use tests to drive development

#### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## Final Assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluator: Andrew

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring


### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance

### 4. MVC & Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

### 5. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance

### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback throughout the process

* Feedback from Andrew:

  I need to learn to become more confident and sure of what I'm doing. I'm whats holding me back in the sense of just not being confident in my code or understanding. Taking a few extra moments to be sure of exactly what's going on, how the page is built, whats needing to be implemented etc. I also need to work on laying out that path of what we are trying to achieve in either a feature test or even small model tests, which I could really use a lot more of. Also, going for a walk, running, doing pushups or something to help get the blood moving and me calming down would also help me greatly.

### Projects

#### Rush Hour
  repo - https://github.com/nickpisciotta/rush-hour-skeleton

  Feedback:
  In the future we will need to implement more robust tests for feature tests and also making sure our model tests are also covering all of our bases and relationships. Make sure all calculations or logic out of the views and back down into the models or elsewhere. Also make sure our tests are organized better to help with more debugging and also just better understanding moving forward. Many calculations or logic could have easily been factored out into a Ruby object. Once again the emphasis on skinny controllers.

#### Little Shop - General Store
  repo - https://github.com/ColinOsborn/general_store

  ## Notes

* Customer Workflow:
  * styling/ux solid
  * add to cart goes to the cart
  * remove from cart works
  * not found search looks good
  * proper search works well
  * cart adjustments and subtotals all work
  * placed order goes to reservation page
  * reserve the order with time
  * pickup times are exclusive
* Admin:
  * can view orders
  * can change the status of orders
  * can create a product
  * probably missing the edit functionality
* Testing
  * 81 pass, 0 fail
* Organization
  * 59+ PRs
  * Good looking Trello
  * lots of feature branches

## Evaluation Process

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Mix-Master
  repo - https://github.com/ColinOsborn/mix_maste

  I really enjoyed this tutorial, while it was a bit time consuming. I enjoyed getting the user story over the tests in the later iterations as it was a good way to learn how to write tests.
  I also liked it since it dealt with Spotify which I hope to do more with. I will be going back over intermission week to add more work to.

#### Sinatra-Crud
  repo - https://github.com/ColinOsborn/robots

  RobotWorld. I thought this was a really cool project that taught me a lot. I remember wishing I had done HTTP in Mod1, but this helped clear up a lot of unknowns about servers and HTTP.

#### Tool Chest
  repo - https://github.com/ColinOsborn/tool_chest
  Fun project that liked playing around with and see how much authentication I could do myself and also trying to add more styling so it doesn't look terrible.

#### Rails Mini Project
  repo - https://github.com/ColinOsborn/Riders-bikes-races

  This is a project I will keep working on. I had a ton of fun, but also many headaches/nightmares trying to get authentication and authorization both working. I also really tried to push myself with those, the relationships and also smaller things like switching up to Rspec testing, Haml instead of Html and a few other ideas.

## Community

### Playing a Part
* Helped setup the Mod2 volunteering for Mod1 students. Also made sure to fill in for any people who couldn't make their slot and also tried to make myself available to Mod1 students when needing help as often as I could
* Gave a lighting talk on How Formula1 cars are producing cleaner more efficient cars for us.
* Wrote a blogpost here: https://medium.com/@ColinOsborn/three-easy-ways-to-make-your-site-mobile-responsive-391fa89eff90#.cztiszoi7
* Also was involved when I could with Hopper Posse helping Mod1 students with their projects etc.

### Giving Feedback
* Nick Pisciotta -

Working on Rush Hour with Nick has been the first time working with him before and it’s impressive to see his pragmatic response to learning and working through problems. Nick is a very strong programmer and is easy to work with. Maybe even a little to easy to work at times, possibly sacrificing direction and input by being too accommodating and not assertive enough. It’s hard to knock someone for being too flexible. But regardless having him in involved in the project is for sure an asset.

* Karina Gonzales -

So far working with Karina on this project, her enthusiasm for the project and eagerness to learn and contribute is very apparent. I feel this things are a very strong attribute and positive for the team as a whole. I do feel that at times, there could be more of a focus on present iterations and less on what could come down the pipe in future iterations. Maybe a need for stepping back and looking at things from a 30,000 foot view I guess? But I know some of this comes from eagerness to deliver a top notch project, with great code following good practices and methodologies.

* Jenny Soden -

  I really enjoyed working with Jenny. After two Modules together already, I never actually worked with her on a project and so it was a lot of fun finally getting a chance to collaborate on something. I really did learn a lot from her and enjoyed seeing her process and approach to problems. I think sometimes Jenny doesn't give herself enough credit on problems or certain things and I think that can hold her or the group back at times. But I also feel like as time went on with a little support she saw that she has a lot to offer and started asserting herself more and feeling more comfortable in that role. At times I think she worries about being bossy, but it never came across as that and usually her input was exactly what we needed. Thanks Jenny!   

* Brain Sayler -

  Working with Brian on Little shop was a fun and very educational experience. I don't think I have ever learned more about git and git workflow. Brian is very methodical and pragmatic with his approach to problems and challenges. I think that is a very strong characteristic of his, but I think it may also end up with him taking on too much and taking on too much on his plate. It's hard to knock a person for that, but I think can hinder his concentration or thought process. Overall Brian is a great guy, an excellent developer and brings a lot to the table for any team. Thanks for working on Little Shop with me.

  * Ryan Batty -
   Ryan, I’ve only worked with you briefly for pairings, but it’s always been really good. You’re extremely knowledgable, smart and enthusiastic about programming and software development. These are awesome traits that, and make you a excellent resource for questions or issues. I can’t even remember how many times I’ve used you as a resource, and thank you for that. I think at times, some of your input is very useful, but may just need to be a bit rephrased(?) I know you’re a great guy with good intentions and never mean to rub people the wrong way, and you do have very valid inputs, so please don’t stop sharing your thoughts or feedback. Also don’t sell yourself short, you’re a good, funny person who I like talking to and excited to work with you on a project. I’d encourage you to share that fun and funny side more often and feel comfortable around everyone here. Thanks for being a part of the cohort!


### Getting Feedback
* Nick Pisciotta -
Colin, I have greatly appreciated your calm demeanor and encouragement working through this frustrating project.  You have been always eager to help and present at all times.  I feel that I may be driving too much, so definitely let me know if you feel like you’re not contributing enough.  I definitely don’t want to come across like my way is superior; I know you’re a strong programmer so let me know if you want to switch things up.

* Jenny Soden -
Colin, you are so easy to work with. You have a laid back attitude which I think is often perceived as not caring, or not able to do work, which I know isn’t true after working with you. I think we have a similar attitude of “just try it” and seeing things through code and working through the problems that arise. I really wish you would be more sure of yourself. You’re a smart guy, and after pairing with you, it seemed like you didn’t really want to touch the keyboard, but after I left and came back there was code written. Know that you’re smart, you can do this, and be more assertive with what you want to do. I think you’ll really benefit from the week off. Come back recharged and rearing to go, and I know nothing will stop you from being a great developer. You have it in you.

* Brian Sayler -
Colin has been a pleasure to work with during our final project, Little Shop.  I particularly liked how he designed the shop's inventory and worked hard on styling our application.   Colin has a solid understanding of Rails and is a good programmer, so I encourage him to be more confident in his abilities going forward.  In particular, I'd like to see Colin be more willing to collaborate on conceptual problem-solving.  While Colin is always eager to contribute, I think he has a tendency to hold back and not engage as much in the decision-making involved when designing an application.  I encourage Colin to jump on opportunities to to share his ideas in future projects. Colin’s light-hearted personality made working on Little Shop fun, and I hope to see him to continue to do so going forward.

* Ryan Batty -
Since the start of Turing, I have not had many opportunities to work with Colin, with the exception of a number of in-class assignments. Regardless, any time we work together, discuss trials and tribulations of Turing, or just chat, I have always enjoyed the discussion. He seems knowledgable,very friendly and approachable. I think perhaps his biggest stumbling block is confidence in his skills, as a number times during the assignments we paired on, he had the answer, and convinced himself he didn't.

## Review

**A. End of Module Assessment: 3**

  To be honest, I wasn't too proud of how I did in my final assessment. I felt like I was a bit of mess, but looking back. I know a lot of that was for sure nerves and much like Andrew said, my lack of confidence in myself and my understanding of rails and ruby. What I have taken away the most from all of this is be more confident and sure of myself and what I'm doing.

**B. Individual Work & Projects: 3**

  This module I really made sure to try and push what we were learning. While on some projects it sort of backfired on me in terms of not having certain features fully functional, I did learn about a lot of ways to do or not do rather something.

**C. Group Work & Projects: 3**

  Much like the feedback I received from Andrew in the mid-mod and final assessment I need to work on being more confident in my work and knowledge that I can offer.

**D. Community Participation:3**

  Although I was happy to help out and pair with as many Mod 1 people I could and who ever needed help. I'd still like to give back more in the future maybe with some student led sessions or taking on more responsibility in my Posse.

**E. Peer and Instructor Feedback:3**

  I feel like after working with different people this time around in Mod2 on much bigger more difficult projects allowed me and probably everyone else a look into how everyone works and their strengths and weaknesses. I feel like and hope that I took a bit more of step forward in giving people better feedback that's beneficial and useful for them.
