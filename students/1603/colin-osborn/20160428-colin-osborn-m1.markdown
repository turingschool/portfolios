### Areas of Emphasis

After repeating Module 1, I came into it with a mission to succeed and not make the same mistakes I made last time. During my Intermission week I did lots of the work assigned to me from Mike Dao over and over again, and also focussed on the input I received from Horace at my 1602 Module 1 Final Assessment. During the Module I made sure to utilize two mentors, and did lots of pairings with people from other Modules to step up my skills and understanding. In addition to doing all homework numerous times and making sure I attained the most from my projects, I also routinely read from the books, Eloquent Ruby and Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby.

### End of Module Assessment
Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: Shopping List

Notes:

* demonstrating tremendous amount of conceptual and application progress from last time
* basic tools seem to be there -- defining objects; using ivars; defining methods
* seem comfortable referring back to the implementation of another class to figure out how
your class to interact with it
* TDD workflow seems good

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Projects

#### Jungle Beats

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Assessed By: Horace

Notes:

* code is quite clean and straightforward -- code we have follows the actual algorithms closely so its easy to follow
* have quite a lot of tests especially on the list itself which is cool
* however even with all the tests we do have there are still some pretty basic cases that fell through the cracks -- need to keep an eye on all these details when testing and make sure we're covering all the cases from the ground up
* this partly comes back to a question of process -- make sure we are still building up from basic to more complex cases; this will likely help us avoid missing some of these fundamental cases
* got all the basic features done and added a couple extensions

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
#### 2. TDD
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality  
#### 3. Encapsulation/Logical components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
#### 4. Fundamental Ruby Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
#### 5. Looping or Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Night Writer

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/colinosborn/nightwriter

Notes:

4 tests in reader
8 tests in writer
Project did not exactly follow spec
only writes, does not read
Uses a characters module which is awesome
think about how you would have two runner files that refer to another single class to convert from braille to text and back.

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application does not complete iterations 0-3
#### 2. TDD
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
#### 3. Encapsulation/Logical components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
#### 4. Fundamental Ruby Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Notes: Bug with the tags from Iteration 4. Finished erb tags

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5
#### 2. TDD
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
#### 3. Encapsulation/Logical Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.
#### 4. Fundamental Ruby Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.
#### 5. Enumerable's and collections
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

Notes: * Extension was a javascript chart showing interactions between merchants and other merchants
* they did a great job keeping classes separate from each other
* test suit had 200+ runs and assertions
* strong understanding of ruby and keeping code clear.

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints

## Community

### Playing a Part
* Particpated in Hackathon - Clarke Coin
* Helped others as much as I could, especially others who were struggling, Tried to share my experiences as someone who struggled and repeated with people who were in the same boat.

### Giving Feedback
* Ling Tran -

I worked with Ling on the Night Writer project a few different times looking for insight on how to solve my problems. Ling was an excellent person to talk to, not just because she had personal experience with the project, but she was always very clear and communicative. She never gave me an answer, but was always able to point into the right direction, or help me in thinking in a certain concept or direction. It’s very clear Ling knows what she’s talking about, and considering how much help I solicited from her, she’s also very eager to help and also learn about other ways to do the same problem.

* Peter Springer -

I worked with Peter back a few weeks ago while working on the Hyde project. Peter was helping with solving an issue with ERB and trying to help his partner and myself to wrap our heads around the challenge. Even when things got frustrating after hours of trying, Peter remained calm and kept us all motivated to keep working hard towards the end goal. I feel that with more time, his skills and understanding will snowball and he’ll turn into an awesome developer. Working with Peter was great because it was clear he was determined to learn and understand Ruby.

* Kerry Sheldon -

Kerry was an amazing partner for Black Thursday. Her organization, and foresight made what could have been quite a stressful project, beyond manageable. Working with Kerry was fantastic. I learned so much from her in ways to set myself up better for future projects, and assignments. Kerry and I did do a DTR, where she was very communicative and open about how she’d like projects to go, and never once did any problems arise. It was true privilege working with her and seeing her skills with Javascript and how they culminated in our Black Thursday project. Much like she said, we both might need work in preventing typos, but I can’t knock her on that since I too am very guilty of some mistyped keys, but truly can’t think of anything else for criticism. Thanks Kerry!

### Getting Feedback
* Ling Tran -

I worked with Colin a few times when he was implementing Night Writer. The thing that stands out about Colin is how quickly he puts feedback into action. The first time we worked together, I noticed he was stuck in his head hypothesizing about issues rather than throwing in a pry. So I showed him how to befriend pry. The next day or so, when we worked together again, he was prying away and seemed really comfortable with the tool. I am impressed by how calm Colin is even under pressure and the clarity with which he asks questions. Colin also seems to be more open this module and I am glad that he is letting people into his world!

* Kerry Sheldon -

Colin was a great partner for Black Thursday.  He was really thorough and open in the DTR conversation and helped us to get a really solid start.  As part of that, Colin showed respect for the fact that I need some time to look at the code independently, outside the pair setting.  Colin was always eager to contribute and make sure that we both pulled our weight.  He also showed me how to read the spec harness and understand how it could help us with our design.  Colin and I both have some improvement to make on improving our typing skills.

* Peter Springer -

Colin and I worked together briefly during the Hyde project. It was nice to work with someone who had been through the struggle before and see how he approached problems. Colin shared some details with me about his first experience taking module 1 and how difficult it was for him. Since I have also found module 1 to be quite difficult it was great to hear about where he started and see how far he has come. Colin is great to work with and his trajectory is inspiring. Leeettssss Gooooo

## Review

**A. End of Module Assessment: 3**

  I felt like I did a decent job on assessment, I was really nervous, because of how the past times had gone, and put a lot of pressure on myself. I did pass with all threes, however I did expect more from myself.

**B. Individual Work & Projects: 3**

  I came into the module with lofty goals. I wanted to receive at least 3's on all of my projects, and I came close but did not do well on Night Writer. It would be all to easy to come with excuses, but once again, didn't hit the mark that I set before hand, however learned more from that single project than probably any before. Aside from Night Writer though, all the rest were pretty successful.

**C. Group Work & Projects: 3**

  I am really proud of what I was able to contribute and accomplish in my group projects. The first project was hit with some difficult moments, but ultimately we were able to right the ship and get done what was needed. In the second partner project, I feel like we pushed each other to our best and we worked as a team the entire time. Not only did we do great on the project, I really loved how much I learned from Kerry and how much more I got to know her. For instance, finding out she is also a big Formula 1 fan, was very surprising.

**D. Community Participation:3**

  I have a three in here, but I really feel like I should and could be doing a lot more. This module I made it a mission to help out and contribute back as much as I could. After struggling so much last time around, I really wanted to make sure I could be someone who could share their experiences and motivate people and also help them get a leg up. I feel like, for a community as special and amazing as this one though I could do a lot more to contribute to. For Participation I made sure to as helpful with the Imposter Syndrome meetings and also took part in the Hackathon. Already for next module, I'm looking forward to doing more and giving back as much as I can. But once again, still room to grow.

**E. Peer and Instructor Feedback:3**

  Much along the same, I feel like I try to give as much feedback that's beneficial and useful for people, however, I know I have room to grow and improve.
