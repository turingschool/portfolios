# Colin Osborn - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I really was set on making sure I understood how to build off what we learned in Rails in making more complex and robust app's like in Pivot. Sadly I felt a bit derailed at times following my crash I had on intermission week, but did my absolute best to bounce back and also gain the most from the projects in the Module.

### End of Module Assessment

Student: Colin


* Not many students use `Rails.application.secrets[:best_buy_api_key]`. Good use of deeper Rails method
* Service object has a solid start to it and is returning results
* API has an action implemented
* Form is taking 4 parameters which is throwing an error
* Review Store model and how to instantiate an array of Store objects
* Tests are looking for data that seem like it would exist from the seeding of data

**Ruby Style**
* **2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components*

**Rails Syntax**
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

**Testing**
* **2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.**

**Progression and Completion**
* **2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.**

**Workflow**
* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

### Work

Here's some of the work I completed during Mod3.

#### (Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/the_pivot)

An online farmers market featuring the Copper Falls Market. A location to shop from your favorite vendors and sellers and also to sell whatever goods you may have.

Assessed by: Nate

Repo: https://github.com/icorson3/the_pivot

Notes:

- Some bugs
- Some less than smooth user flows. I have to go back to my dashboard to add another item. And I can filter by a category that I'm not viewing.
- *Blink* *Blink* *Blink*
- Other ways you can do things, but no big red flags in your code.
- Look into Presenters for thinner controllers
- Don't be afraid to use JS libraries, as you learn more JS
- Experiment more. Moar functionality. Moar technology. Moar features.

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* **3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.**

**2. Organization**

* **4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.**

**3. Git Workflow**

* **3: Team always used pull requests to introduce code to their project.**

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* **4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).**

**2. Code Quality**

* **4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.**

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* **3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.**


### Risk taking and creativity

**1. Extensions**

* **4: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.**


#### (Rails Engine)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/rails-engine)

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:

- What up with no tests? *tests were abandoned partially because test coverage was really good on the pivot at the cost of features, and I pushed them to do more features in future projects*
- Good work not using enumerables in BI queries
- Good use of formatting data on intake and presentation
- Some inconsistencies in active record, but still pretty Good
- Could use scopes for common where, like successful Transactions
- Talked about how jBuilder is the one true customizer, but good use of serializers

### Feature Delivery

**Completion**
  * **4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.**

**Test-Driven Development**
  * **1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.**

**Code Quality**
  * **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

**API Design*
  * **4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.**

**Queries**
  * **4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.**

#### Training-Tracker

Assessor: Sally

Notes:

* Testing was really good, goals was missing the creation test so you weren't
  able to catch it wasn't working on prod.
* Few the gaps in the UI, can't add a goal from the goal index
* Notifications controller should actually be put into a service
* Good job on the view helpers, partials. A lot of the controllers were clean
  and methods were short.

  **Completion**
  * **3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.**

  **Organization**
  * **2: Developer used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.**

  **Test-Driven Development**
  * **2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).**

  **Code Quality**
  * **2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.**

  **User Experience**
  * **2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.**

  **Performance**
  * **4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.**


### Getting Feedback

* From Ilana Corson:
Colin was alway willing to help out wherever he was needed. I would love if Colin took more initiative when it came to problem solving. I also feel like Colin would benefit from asking for help sooner. Sometimes, he would go down a rabbit hole that might not been as deep had he asked for help. I always appreciate Colin's "go with the flow" attitude and his laid back approach to programming.

* From Robbie Jaeger:
Even though Colin was dealing with his injuries and health checkups, he was still there each day to help with the group's efforts. He always brought a positive attitude to the group. Colin took on some great features during the Pivot and most were very successful. For some of the features, Colin ran into some implementation trouble. In the future, I think Colin can work on saying something earlier about running into any major issues. Sometimes, Colin would come back the next morning with the issue he was having, when we could have tried to help him get past it the night before over Screenhero or Slack. Toward the end of the project, Colin got better at taking risks and working with JS and jQuery by pairing with Parker. I thought this was great for Colin to take a risk and dive into something I know he didn't feel comfortable with. I hope he continues to take risks and get comfortable with the unknown going forward like he did during the Pivot.

* From Parker Phillips:
Colin! Working with you was a blast, I really enjoyed our pairing on the last couple of features the last few days. You are one of the most easy going people I have met, and in the thick of the pivot that mentality is a breath of fresh air. Sometimes being that easy going can turn against you though. A couple of times when we were discussing what we wanted to work on we didn't hear much from you. I know you are more than competent enough to tackle any of the tasks that were at hand, but being easy going I feel like you were waiting for people to ask you to do something instead of volunteering. With the right personality fit I imagine this working perfectly in certain groups, however our group was hesitant to ask others to do something. It would have been nice to hear your opinion more often during those times. All in all I sincerely enjoyed working with you, and I hope we have another opportunity to do so.
