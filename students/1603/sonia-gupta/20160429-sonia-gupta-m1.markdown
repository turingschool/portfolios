# Sonia Gupta - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of this module, I had a number of lofty ambitions that have since taken on a much more realistic tenor. I initially expected to absorb the material at the same rate as my peers, and to be able to shift my mindset to accommodate algorithmic thinking. Unfortunately, I have not met most of my goals and have committed to repeating Module 1.  

Nonetheless, the experience has been incredibly valuable, and quite humbling. I have begun the arduous process of shifting my thinking to accommodate the very specific logic required of OOP. Specifically, I have made significant progress in understanding the construction of classes and methods and how they interact with each other.

I am confident that I will be able to successfully repeat Module 1.

### End of Module Assessment

Due to my early decision to repeat the module, I was not asked to complete an end-of-module assessment.

### Work

I submitted JungleBeats and Enigma, and participated through the first two days of HTTP with my partner Nick Pisciotta. I did not complete any of the projects.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/junglebeats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

We were asked to implement a linked list. Despite Horace's effective demonstration, this project is where I first began to experience the disconnect between conceptualization and implementation which plagues me to this day. I struggled profoundly with this project and spent a lot of time asking my peers for help. I did not complete all of the iterations.

Having reviewed the project in advance of preparing this portfolio, however, I now realize that I *have* learned something after all (woot woot). At the time, I didn't understand *why* I was doing what I was doing. I was simply following the suggestions of others. I now have a better understanding of why the implementation works the way it does.

Mike's Notes:
* approximately 8 tests
* tests cover methods written
* could use some edge cases covered
* completed to iteration 2
* some use of extraneous variables

Scores:
* Functional Expectations = 1
* TDD = 3
* Encapsulation / Logic = 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style = 3
* Looping or Recursion = 3

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

We were asked to build an Enigma machine with encryption, decryption, and cracking capabilities. I was able to build the encryption and decryption methods although there were some failures during my evaluation. I actually enjoyed this project and felt that I was coming to some sort of broader understanding, although I'm no longer sure that's actually true.

Horace's Notes:
* got some good progress on the decrypt and encrypt
* seemed to have few things come apart at the seams at  the last minute -- possibly there are some techniques we can look at to help avoid these gaps opening up
* sounds like we are doing good things from the pseudocoding / outlining / conceptualizing perspective
* now we need to start translating these ideas into more concrete expression via tests
* hopefully the tests also help us answer some of these questions around how do the different objects fit together

Scores:

* Overall Functionality = 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style = 3
* TDD = 1
* Breaking Logic into Components = 3

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

Myself and other repeaters were assigned Chisel as a special project. It took me a long time to grasp the fundamentals of what I was doing and I was unable to complete the project. However, as I write this, I realize I learned a lot from the project. I've been working on Battleship and a lot of the logical thinking is really starting to coalesce for me. It's sort of exciting, actually!

## Team

### Projects

I worked on part of HTTP with Nick Pisciotta. By the second day of working together, I realized that I was far behind in my understanding and decided to drop out of the project. Nick was a pleasure to work with, and I learned a good amount from him, but I simply could not keep up with the demands of the project. He ended up completing the vast majority of the project on his own. As such, I do not feel it would be appropriate to include the project in my own portfolio.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

*Ali Andersen*: Ali has been such an important part of my support system. He has consistently reached out to me when he has seen me struggling, and his kindness knows no bounds. Not only is he extremely empathic, but his skill level and effective pedagogical style make him a fantastic tutor. He helped me a lot with Enigma, and really walked me through an understanding of the method I needed. I would have not been able to get as far as I did without his help. Ali is truly an asset to the Turing community and I am privileged to know him.

*Nick Pisciotta*: I was lucky enough to partner with Nick on HTTP. Although I struggled profoundly with the project, Nick was always patient with me. He often stopped to explain what he was doing, and never admonished me for my lack of understanding. He was pretty much the ideal partner. Beyond that, Nick brings a positive attitude to his work and exhibits a phenomenal amount of fortitude when faced with problems he initially can’t solve. He is not afraid to ask for help, but he knows when to press forward on his own. His discipline will serve him well and I’m excited to see his progress.

*Ryan Batty*: Ryan has been an integral part of 1603, and I am better for having known him. His kindness and eagerness to help have helped me through some rough patches. He has an ideal mix of empathy and skill, and he has helped so many of us to become better coders. I suspect that Ryan will become extremely successful due not only to his drive, discipline, and ability, but also because he's just a really good person.

*Karina Gonzalez*: Karina has been a huge asset to 1603, and to Turing as a whole. Her boundless energy and optimism foster a supportive and enthusiastic environment. I have often seen her working late into the night while still maintaining a positive attitude when faced with obstacles. Her tenacity and kind nature have profoundly resonated with me, and I am inspired by her successes.

*Erin Greenhalgh*: It was truly a pleasure getting to know Erin this module. I admire her hard work and dedication, and the ease with which she interacts with her partners. She has an incredible amount of perseverance in the face of adversity, and I’ve noticed that she meets obstacles with an optimistic resolve to push through them--she does not capitulate. I am glad to have had the chance to get to know her and have no doubt that she will be an exceptionally successful and skillful developer!

*Marlo Major*: Marlo has been incredibly helpful for me this module. I have been struggling a lot, and he took it upon himself to seek me out and offer me valuable advice related to programming and to life in general. He has also paired with me on several occasions. His teaching style allowed me to come to my own conclusions without feeling helpless. The emotional and academic support Marlo provided has contributed considerably to my progress, and I'm truly grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from him.

*Sal Espinosa*: Sal has been incredibly helpful this module. I have paired with him a few times and his teaching style is exemplary. He allowed me to reach my own conclusions in a gentle and supportive environment. We are cautioned in Module 1 to never allow others to "steal our learning" and Sal is the perfect example of a teacher who leads his students to achieve their own understanding instead of simply handing over the answers. His tutoring helped me to establish a level of confidence in my own skills at an early stage, and I am grateful to have had the privilege to learn from him.

### Being a Community Member

*Erin Greenhalgh*: Of all the people I have had the pleasure to meet in Mod 1, Sonia has stood out to me for her hard work and earnest demonstration of grit. I consistently saw Sonia working on evenings and on the weekends and diving again and again into material that was challenging and frustrating. I entirely admire her determination to push through and to put in the time to learn, and I know that this will lead her to success. In addition, Sonia’s friendliness and compassion made her a great person to have in our class.

*Nick Pisciotta*: I had the opportunity of working together with Sonia on HTTPYYKM.  She showed remarkable perseverance throughout the course of the project, and was very communicative about her shortcomings on some of the topics.  She is undoubtedly ambitious, and her dedication to learning how to program will serve her well throughout her education. I have know doubt she will ascertain all the necessary skills to become a great developer.

*Ryan Batty* Sonia is one of the few people I have met at Turing that I consider both a valued colleague and close friend. While she has faced difficulties in the program, I personally feel that with more confidence in her skills, she will go extremely far, because she truly wants to. Furthermore, a number of times when I felt insecure about my progress or had a concern, she was the first to listen, and help assure me that everything would be alright. In all honesty I am sure I would not of enjoyed my time in Module 1 as much without her there. Her admirable work ethic, positive attitude, and sheer honesty gave me something to strive to emulate on a daily basis.

### Playing a Part

I volunteered to speak to prospective students and share my experience with them. I spoke of the challenges and rigor of the program, but I believe I was able to offer some inspiration as well. I'm told that I helped at least one student to decide to enroll, and he is now in 1605.

I was honored to be nominated to serve as an SAB rep for my cohort. I believe I was able to effectively serve my peers and to channel their praise and frustrations.

I took out the trash on a few occasions when I noticed it was full.

I brought big cartons of Goldfish to school to share with others on the weekends. Yum. ;)
