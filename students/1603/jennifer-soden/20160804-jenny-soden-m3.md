# Jenny Soden - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to learn to construct and consume APIs. I wanted to understand more of what goes on under the hood of Rails.
I wanted to understand the material given and the projects assigned.

### End of Module Assessment

Student: Jenny Soden

Notes:

* Good test value. Testing nearly everything in the user story. Using VCR. Model and Service unit tests
* Could DRY out service, but totally functional
* Model has the responsibilities we're looking for
* Trying to solve some problem I'm unaware of in `Store.new` in model
* Store controller is nice and small
* First API consumption user story complete, except for store limiting
* Great git workflow with pull requests!

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* **4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Testing

* **4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.**

### 4. Progression/Completion

* **2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.**

### 5. Workflow

* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

### Work

This module I worked on the personal project.

Assessor: Nate

Notes:

- Find a way to make the tests work even if you delete the cassettes
- Otherwise, tests are providing good value
- Moar tabs
- Find your process. You can suss out solutions to these problems, by sussing the problems.

Assessed by: Nate

Notes:
- Some UI things. Not really polished enough. Flash messages got swallowed. Some unintuitive redirects.
- Long conversation about testing. Coverage helps you find the things you're missing. The tests you've written provide good value for the things they're testing. TDD feels unnatural for you, so keep experimenting. Find your inner TDD.
- Could use scopes. Active is the only reasonable default scope, but listen to whatever your boss tells you.
- Look into decorators if you like. Josh likes Presenters.


### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* **4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**

**2. Organization**

* **4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.**

**3. Git Workflow**

* **3: Team always used pull requests to introduce code to their project.**

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* **2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).**

**2. Code Quality**

* **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* **3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.**

### Risk taking and creativity

**1. Extensions**

* **4: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.**

##### From Ryan
My one fellow Star Wars fan! With the exception of my ability to remember your preferred name the majority of the time, I think our group experience was very positive. I really appreciated how forthcoming you were when it came to feedback on ideas and issues, and the fact that you were always willing to chime in when necessary. That said, I do wish that you weren't quite so quick to lean towards the "Glass Half Full" mentality. While useful to keep things in perspective, sometimes it comes off as a lack of faith in the group, which can be trying. As you move forward, perhaps try looking for successes you can really rally behind and champion the group's progress.

##### From Charlie
Jenny, you said at mod 2 retro that you hadn't gotten a chance to know me yet, and I could not disagree. I'm thankful for the opportunity to work with you on pivot. What you call, you being "real", was a breathe of fresh air. It eliminated a lot of mental stress knowing that when you gave your opinion on something, there was no held back feelings. It made making decisions as a group a much smoother process. I do wish that you gave those opinions a little more often. I know sometimes it was frustrating for you when we would talk for a while about general project decisions, but some of them felt like they were worth the discussion and I at times wished you would give more input. Your input mattered/matters in group settings and I think it would be beneficial for you and future groups/partnerships if you gave more of it. Another thing I greatly appreciated was your willingness to work on WHATEVER needed to be worked on. You let me get my tries in styling for a few days and when I was sick of doing it, you really took the reigns and truly knocked it out of the park. Thanks for putting the team first throughout the entire process.

##### From Deb
You did a great job with tackling any coding challenge assigned and also taking initiative to be accountable for unpopular areas like styling. You were a trooper when you really needed to tend to your injury. Sometimes your assessment of our team's productivity when we were all together seemed impatient and overly critical. When you were visibly upset, I wish we could have talked through it more as a group to address it. The extra time you spent with me to pair and collaborate was very valuable to me. Thank you!

#### Rails Engine

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Marcella, you were a great rails engine partner. We were able to divide and conquer while keeping in communication which is amazing! We both had slight issues following the divisions of the spec, so I think we could pay attention a little more as to who does what, but it seemed to work out well. You kicked ass on testing! Thanks for being my partner (even though you had no choice).

### Being a Community Member

##### Ben Pepper
Jenny and I haven't paired this mod.  However, she is a wonderful friend and is always willing to talk with me and listen about whats going on.  She continues to exemplify many qualities that Turing tries to instill in the students.  She always has a smile on her face and an unwavering willingness to jump into any problem and see what happens when a method or variable is changed.  She is a wonderful person to know and associate with.

##### Kris Sparks
Jenny is always encouraging and willing to help. She has been an enthusiastic and helpful mentor for two consecutive mods. She listens thoughtfully and offers great feedback. Jenny is a great communicator and asset to the community at large.

### Playing a Part

This module I had a regular pairing session with a module 2 student once a week, and tried to give my fellow students advice and emotional support.

### Self Evaluation

#### Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

##### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates that skill across a variety of work.

* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.

### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above-and-beyond supports of the community.

### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
