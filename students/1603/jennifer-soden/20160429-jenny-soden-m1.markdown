### Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to become more confident in myself and my abilities. Repeating made me feel as though I had something to prove, to Turing because I was chosen to be here, and to myself. After having a rough time the first time around, I wanted to be sure that this is something I wanted to pursue and something I could pursue. During the module, I was able to help others and I realized that I *am* capable of this, because I am able to help others' understanding as well as solidify my own. Being able to figure out a problem, and to help others figure out problems is still one of the most gratifying feelings I've had in my life.

I want this, and I am capable.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: Shopping List

Notes:

* Testing workflow seems pretty comfortable
* OOP fundamentals are good -- doing well defining new classes, defining new methods, using
instance variables as needed to store and track state
* Seem pretty comfortable understanding how the object changes state over time
* Basic hash manipulation is solid -- reading / writing keys, using hashes to model things
* Still would like to get a little more solid and fluid on the more sophisticated collection
manipulations

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

### Work
I completed the following Individual work this module:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)


Assessed By: Horace

Notes:

* base expectations working as expected through i6
* lets us change the rate and voice by passing a parameter wooo
* implementation is pretty clean and easy to follow - experimenting with breaking out lots of helper methods as private methods to decompose some of the more complicated processes
* this is effective at keeping method lengths shorter
to some extent makes the logic a bit harder to follow as it gets pulled out into different places
* recursion is pretty effective throughout the code -- seem to have a pretty good grasp of this now and are applying it effectively

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the
functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

Assessed By: Lovisa

Notes taken during evaluation:
* Things could be broken out into different classes more - SRP
  * Converter could be a parent class to the different translations instead of having converter containing both English to Braille and Braille to English
* More helper methods
* Sometimes in the methods too much is broken out
* Could have private methods for testing

#### 1. Overall Functionality

3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Team

### Projects

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/lcmccartney/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* 17 tests all pass
* Would like to have seen a little more in depth testing, testing for content as well as existance.
* 91 percent test coverage.
* Some opportunities to refactor with longer methods.
* Overall code was clear and easy to follow.
* Think about how you can pull out unnecessary variable assignment to separate methods.
*

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AnnaCW/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* 163 runs, 100 percent test coverage
* Spec harness 35 seconds
* Remember the law of Demeter
* Test for edge cases in tests.
* Push logic down the stack to the lowest level objects.

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints

### Giving Feedback

###### Anna Weisbrodt
Anna is a wonderful partner. Through Black Thursday I’ve seen her grow and am constantly surprised by her capabilities. She is able to work though crunchy problems with determination. She’s very communicative and able to get her ideas across to others. She could work on a couple of minor things, like when using enumerables that return altered content, not assigning them to variables and returning explicitly. She knows enumerables, but could use a little more practice implementing the right one for the job. She also gets stuck sometimes, and waits a little too long for asking for help. That being said, I have already seen progress in improving these things. I think that as long as she continues working, she will be very successful.

###### Ryan Batty
Ryan was really fun to work with. Together we were able to figure out how to make our own AND logic gate! His passion for programming really pours through and you can tell that this what he wants to do. He was easily able to bang out code and was really easy to work with, taking pretty much all my suggestions. I felt as though we were able to have a conversation about the problem at hand, and that is something that’s very easily overlooked when programming — the discussion about it. I think he could stand to slow down a little, everything he does is so fast that little errors popped up here and there, but it really wasn’t a big deal. I wish I had more constructive things to say, but we didn’t work together for very long. Overall, I think Ryan’s passion and skill set will take him very far.

###### Lin McCartney
I really enjoyed working with you on Hyde. I feel like it was a good learning experience for both of us. I think you did a really good job with the project and you never quit working on it. Your sheer determination of will is inspiring. I feel like you could use just more practice coding because you have a good tactic of how to get it done but sometimes have confusion on execution, but that just comes with doing more projects. I think if you keep coding, you’ll do really well. And you were able to figure out ERB which is still magic to me. Keep at it, I believe you will do fantastic things.

### Being a Community Member

###### From Anna
I've really enjoyed and appreciated working with you on Black Thursday. You are solid overall as a programmer - good work flow / work processes, troubleshooting, desire to learn, and openess to different approaches. Several specific areas where I admire your skills and learned a lot from you: SimpleCov, test helpers, GitHub, Pry, and advanced use of the reduce enumerable. I also appreciate that you stayed positive and patient throughout the project. The only comment I have in terms of things you may want to work on/think about is just being more assertive/not afraid to own it. I sometimes felt like you were asking permission when it was definitely a joint effort. It has been great working with you. I’m really happy with how much I’ve learned and how our project has turned out!

###### From Ryan
Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to work with Jennifer much, but the times I did were definitely enjoyable. Many times I was surprised by her unique viewpoint for the problem at hand, resulting in a solution I would of never considered. Our discussions always felt very natural, which resulted in a calm and confident atmosphere, making it easier to progress through the programming challenges we faced together. I look forward to the chance to work together with her again in the future.

###### From Lin
Jenny has been the most helpful and supportive person to me in the cohort.  I felt like I could go to her when I needed to ask a question or needed advice in general.  I am a person who has always relied on myself and have always been reluctant to seek assistance from others, however Jenny’s willingness to help is an inspiration to me, and I hope I can reciprocate that in the future, and also provide the same level support for others who are in doubt.  My only advice is to keep on coding for fun, and to not let a difficult problem/concept keep you from trying to conquer the issue. Keep being you because you are seriously amazing!
