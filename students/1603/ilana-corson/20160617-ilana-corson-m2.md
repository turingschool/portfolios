## Individual

### Area of Emphasis

This module I really wanted to focus on learning more about the tech world in general. I enjoyed the group emphasis on work flow since that mimicks the work we would be doing as professional developers. The projects helped to solidify the abundant knowledge we were learning in class and I finally felt that I could see my work come to life.

### Evaluated Projects

#### Rush Hour

Assessed by: Andrew

* [Github](https://github.com/icorson3/rush-hour-skeleton)

##### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application fulfills base expectations

##### Test-Driven Development

- 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

- 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

- 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

##### Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

- 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

##### View Layer

- 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

##### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

- 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Little Shop

Assessed by: Jhun

* [Github](https://github.com/Riizu/hiptique)
* [Heroku](http://hiptique.herokuapp.com/)

Notes: - great test coverage - tests are granular and scoped to specific html ids and classes which I like a lot. - Model test test validations and attempts to create without required validations. - All the views. I mean all of them had a partial. I like that. - great pull request conversations about code - Models are strong with a little more effort could hit the 4 mark easily. More feedback at the bottom in the feedback gist.

##### Functionality

- 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

##### Views

- 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

##### Controllers

- 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

##### Models

- 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

##### Testing

- 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

##### Usability

- 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

##### Workflow

- 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
