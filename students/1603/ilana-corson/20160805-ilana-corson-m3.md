Assessed by: Nate

* [Github](https://github.com/icorson3/the_pivot)
* [Heroku](http://copper-falls-market.herokuapp.com/)

##### Notes:

* Some bugs
* Some less than smooth user flows. I have to go back to my dashboard to add another item. And I can filter by a category that I'm not viewing.
* Blink Blink Blink
* Other ways you can do things, but no big red flags in your code.
* Look into Presenters for thinner controllers
* Don't be afraid to use JS libraries, as you learn more JS
* Experiment more. Moar functionality. Moar technology. Moar features.
