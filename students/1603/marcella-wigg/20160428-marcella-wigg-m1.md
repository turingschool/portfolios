# Marcella Wigg - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with limited programming experience (from some independent study and an introductory Java class in college), and one of the main objectives I had was to correct some of the things I feel went wrong in the past. First, I wanted to force myself to fully understand concepts when seeking help from more experienced programmers, instead of just going along with what they are saying; second, I wanted to dig into the basics of Ruby and comprehend every item of code I was adding.

### End of Module Assessment

**Assessed by**: Jhun

**Notes**
* Ruby syntax, style, use of blocks and enumerations, workflow, and collaboration all on level expected for end of module 1.
* The testing is your weakness. You know how to write tests, but the testing is not driving your development enough. Work on TDD.
* You were very nervous, and that seemed to affect your performance. Take a breath. You are doing fine. I think of you as a strong developer.

**Scores**
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Work

While I struggled with following through in my early assignments in this module, and it was not until the last couple of weeks of the module that I really feel I have hit my stride, conceptually, I am proud of the progress I made from the first week to the third. The difference between my understanding in the original binary search tree assignment and the trie assignment was vast, and I think central to that was feeling comfortable asking other people for help and spending longer hours at the building itself.

Create binary search tree that recommends items.

**Assessed by** Nate

**Comments**
* Good TDD, but go get some help understanding the concept if it's slowing you down
* Get help earlier. Working for two days and not understanding without help is not healthy
* Get code working first, and then work on refactoring. It looks like you spent more time refactoring working things instead of making new things work
* Concepts are coming together, but you're missing out on completion

**Scores**

1. Functional Expectations: 1
2. Test-Driven Development: 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
5. Looping *or* Recursion: 3

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Create program that sorts via several algorithms.

**Assessed by** Lovisa

**Comments**
* Code is mostly clean, though could be refactored into shorter methods in a few places.
* Testing thorough enough. Tested for each method.
* Tests need better, more consistent names, as they are not currently consistently clear as to what they are doing.

**Scores**
1. Functional Expectations: 3
2. Testing: 3
3. Ruby Style: 3
4. Organization: 4

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/marcellawigg/complete-me)

Using tries, created a basic autocompletion system.

**Assessed by** Lovisa

**Comments**
* Improved testing syntax from previous time. More consistent
* Could have more full test coverage.
* Use of enumerators decent; usually chose right one, but there were a few places where you could have chosen better.
* Good breakdown into logical components.

**Scores**
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

## Team

### Projects

Overall, I think both HTTP and Black Thursday have been majorly time consuming, but that has been important for me because working with partners has connected me to the community of Turing in a way I had not been when I had been able to just go home right after class, and thus given me the opportunity to seek more extensive help for issues I have encountered with my code. In the last three weeks of the module, working with other people and collaborating more extensively than I had done previously, I feel that so many things that had been shaky clicked. This experience was really fundamental to being able to code effectively by the end of this module, which is a point I think I have reached. Staying until ten at night really does make a difference, and I didn't understand in the beginning how huge it would be!

#### HTTP, Yeah, You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Built a server with ability to play several basic games using Ruby.

**Comments**
* First group to use a module. I liked that. Code was pretty clean. Some portions had pieces and parts to look at and work on but with what they had i think they were okay.
* little to no test.
* For the most part their code had single lined methods and had single responsibility. I feel if they had more time things could of been a little tidier but I do like the implementation of the classes.

**Scores**
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3.5

## Community

### Giving Feedback

**(For Karina)** Karina inspired me with her resourcefulness and drive as a partner, and I feel fortunate to have worked with her. Early on in the first module, I hesitated in asking other students for help, but Karina not only showed me that asking higher-module students for help is acceptable, she introduced me to students I now feel using as references in the future! The long hours she puts in at Turing show both her drive to succeed in her coding and her strong involvement with the Turing community.

**(For Ilana)** Ilana was a great partner for Black Thursday, with an impressive attention to detail that was vital to making our project a success. Pair programming with her is a pleasure because she communicates well, is flexible with her scheduling, and always manages to critique constructively. Her involvement in the Turing community was also a great asset to our team, as she was able to ask students in other cohorts for some assistance at points at which we were stuck, which is a skill I'm still trying to get comfortable with.

**(For Brian)** On the afternoon before the Black Thursday assignment was due, despite the fact that he had a lot of work on his own project, Brian spent over an hour helping my group try to figure out how we could best find a particular result when one of our methods wasn't passing and we were frustrated. I have seen him help multiple other people under similar circumstances, as well, and I think this says a lot for his high degree of community involvement here. Even when he's facing his own challenges with a project, he tries to help the stuck as much as he can.

**(For Lucy)** Several times during the module, Lucy assisted me with aspects of my projects I was struggling with. I especially appreciated her spending more than half an hour of her own work time to patiently explain concepts I did not yet understand on the day before Black Thursday was due. She has a strong grasp on the Ruby fundamentals, which shows both in her strong code and her ability to cogently explain concepts, and was kind to me about my understanding at a time when I felt very frustrated.

### Being a Community Member

**(From Ilana)** From day one, Marcella was an easy going partner. Her ability to define the relationship from the beginning, helped set expectations for the whole project. She was open to working whenever was most convenient and stayed exceptionally focused. Whenever we would hit a frustrating part of Black Thursday, Marcella would be the one to push us to fight through the problem. She would anticipate bugs before they happened and would know when running tests, exactly the information we were expecting. Marcella was patient when I would get frustrated and her motivation to complete the task at hand inspired me to keep moving forward in a difficult time. I would recommend Marcella to anyone as a wonderful partner or any company.

**(From Lucy)** "I've been lucky enough to have a chance to work with Marcella on several occasions now. Time and time again I am impressed with the dedication and commitment she has shown to Turing. Her dedication to learning everything Turing has to offer is evident in her knowledge of Ruby fundamentals and desire to not only get her projects done but get them done well. Her incredible work ethic shows through each day in class and on her projects. I look forward to getting the chance to work with her in the future."
