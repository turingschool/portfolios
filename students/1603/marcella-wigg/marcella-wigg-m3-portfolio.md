# Marcella Wigg - M3 Portfolio

=======================================

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I want to better understand Rails and APIs

### End of Module Assessment

Student:

Notes:

* Good start on request specs, but unfinished. Not actually testing anything.
* Feature test for consuming an API is testing for most of the user story elements.
* No unit level tests
* Service is working and logically broken out
* Could break out params in your service
* Some confusion about how to use OpenStruct in your model. Let's talk about that.

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* **2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.**

### 3. Testing

* **2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.**

### 4. Progression/Completion

* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

### 5. Workflow

* **3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes**

## Team

#### Feedback about me

(from Jenny) Marcella, you were a great rails engine partner. We were able to divide and conquer while keeping in communication which is amazing! We both had slight issues following the divisions of the spec, so I think we could pay attention a little more as to who does what, but it seemed to work out well. You kicked ass on testing! Thanks for being my partner (even though you had no choice).

(from Nick) Marcella is another very strong programmer and intelligent individual.  She gladly accepts any duty delegated to her, as well as makes a strong priority to work on any of her shortcomings.  For this particular project she wanted more practice on styling and design.  She produced an incredible, production ready landing page.   She also took on some of the more complicated schema relationships. We discussed with Marcella as a group in our second DTR that she could be a bit more communicative with the group in regards to her progress with tasks and when she needed help/guidance. From that conversation onward, she took our advice and was more vocal about her progress.  She should continue to build on this and become more assertive considering she has so much to offer.  It was great working with Marcella, she thrives independently and in a group setting.

(from Kerry) You did an amazing job with the styling on the home page and I was really impressed with your resolve and ability to stick with something through to completion.  I know you were looking to take lead on some aspects of the project, and I hope you feel that you accomplished that with this project.  You were really dependable and always came through on your project components.   Because we kept our foot on the gas through the early portion of the project, it gave us the opportunity to spend extra time on styling, which was important to our team's personal learning goals.  On future projects, it may be hard to devote as much time styling, so it may be something to keep an eye on in terms of the added benefit that comes out of those final styling efforts (vs other project components).  You made really substantial contributions to the project and the team and I enjoyed working with you.

## Community

I don't know that I go above and beyond with the community at Turing, and this is something I need to work on. Nate mentioned in the final assessment that I need to communicate more,

I do not know I deserve to pass, really. I would like to propose that over the break week I work on a simpler app with a less "reach"-y scope than I'd had previously. I know you are out of town, probably, but
