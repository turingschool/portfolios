### Areas of Emphasis

I did not do what I had set out to accomplish during this module so I will be repeating in order to become a coding ninja. That being said, I gained a great idea of where I want to be with realistic expectations. Now I simply need to heed that process and put in the hours.

### Work

For my personal projects I choose to work on Jungle Beats and Enigma.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laner12/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Laner12/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Built a linked list using either incursion or recursion.


###### Assessed By: Mike

19 test total, all are passing.

Some edge cases not covered.

Be careful with extraneous variable assignment.

Watch for indentation.



#### Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations
#### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
#### Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laner12/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Laner12/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Built an encryption engine capable of receiving text, then encrypting or decrypting that text.


##### Assessed By: Horace

Produced some good code that solves part of the project.

Seemed to get off track a bit at the beginning and probably could have benefitted from more attention to the spec and the project directions.

Code itself is ok -- main points would be to try to rely less on instance variables and to focus on extracting more small objects to hopefully help us reduce some of the duplication between multiple similar processes.

Definitely need to focus on more testing and especially would like to see you focusing on this as the next step in the pseudocoding / outlining process -- pseudocode helps us describe what a thing needs to do and testing is a way to make that even more concrete and specific.

Look for things that are similar but vary only in slight ways -- then figure out how to make an object that encapsulates the "similar" bits but allows the different bits to get passed in as an argument of some sort.


#### Overall Functionality

2: Application is missing one of the three operations
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
#### Test-Driven Development

2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
#### Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility


## Team

### Projects

During my pair and group projects I collaborated on HTTP and Black Thursday.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Laner12/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Built a server to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, while also working in paired groups.

##### Assessed By: Tess

Got through iteration 3.

The code was well written up to that point.

A 2 for testing because the word search functionality wasn't tested in the server test.



#### Overall Functionality

2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3
Echo/Foxtrot Note: Requirements listed are for Foxtrot pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
#### Test-Driven Development

2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
#### Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities



#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Laner12/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

Built a database of objects that can interact, deduce, and gather information for the user.

##### Assessed By: Mike

186 tests, spec harness runs in under 7 minutes.

100 percent coverage
rake sanitation :+1:


Overall, well written and executed project.


Use instance variables to contain object information

Remember the law of Demeter.

#### Functional Expectations

3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
#### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
#### Enumerable & Collections

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
#### Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

4: Zero complaints

### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback to Erin Greenhalgh:

 Erin was a strong partner to have on our first pair project. Starting out we were able to work towards a common goal and shoot ideas off each other easily. After a few days had passed the dynamic between us and our workflow had altered due to my perceived lack in technical skill. During this shift in dynamic, Erin did such a wonderful job of including me in her thought process and presenting the code to me in a way that I could follow while we moved forward. She was very attentive and patient with me throughout the entire partnership. Erin demonstrated that she has a good understanding of ruby fundamentals but beyond that she demonstrated how adaptive and well rounded she is as a partner. Best of all the stress of the assignment never compromised her bubbly eager attitude!

###### Feedback to Parker Phillips:

Working with Parker on the final project Black Thursday was a great experience. Coming into this project I felt very unsure of my skills and how to manage the workload but that didn’t seem to phase Parker in anyway. After only a few hours of working with him I was amazed at his level of comprehension of ruby fundamentals and workflow. We were able to verbally work through issues and create the starting framework of the project. Once we had a rough plan, Parker was able to take it and run with it with flawless execution. I am very curious to see how fast he excels during this program. Overall Parker was a great team member. He would always keep me in the loop and never hesitated to take a step backwards to explain in a manner that kept me up to speed.

###### Feedback to Ryan Batty:

Ryan Batty: Working with Ryan on Black Thursday was a great experience. He had joined my group a few days after the project had started and for many that would have been a challenging feat. For Ryan however, the change was seamless and within minutes of looking over our current code base he was able to offer advice and positive critique. His influence within our group only grew. Ryan also did a great job making sure I felt like I was getting everything out of the project that I could, which demonstrated to me how strong his so-called soft skills are. Outside of our project Ryan is constantly helping other students with problems and questions. Overall he is a strong team player with outstanding coding skills.

###### Feedback to Jason Hanna:

Jason and I did not have the opportunity to be partners on a project. However, we had worked along side one another many times throughout the module. During these interactions he and I shared a common mindset in how we would like to progress through module 1. That being said we both had plenty of struggles and set backs but that did not keep Jason from forging ahead and working on his personal success. I look forward to spending more time in the dungeon with you!


### Being a Community Member


###### Feedback to me from Erin Greenhalgh:
 Though I know it was frustrating for Lane to feel like he couldn’t contribute as much on our HTTP project, I appreciated his willingness to stick it out and work through the problems as much as he could. I also really appreciated his positivity, friendliness, and flexibility. His easy-going manner and can-do attitude makes him a pleasure to work with.

###### Feedback to me from Parker Phillips:
 Working with Lane on Black Thursday gave me a better insight into his skills as a developer. He was very upfront early about his strengths and weaknesses to let me know where he was at. It was very obvious that one of his strongest areas of coding was being able to conceptualize what needed to be done; I know he is repeating the module to iron out his weaknesses, but it is exciting to see where he will go with his talents. It was also apparent how hungry Lane was to learn more. He was a patient partner, but was absorbing as much as he could. He didn't let setbacks get him down, and his drive and motivation is incredibly admirable.

###### Feedback to me from Ryan Batty:

Lane Winham: If I had to describe Lane in one word, it would be fluid. Working with Lane never presented any difficulty, and any time he may of had difficulty, he was very adept at working with myself and/or Parker to resolve the issue. His fundamental understanding and skill at breaking down problems is top-notch, though I know his largest goal is to improve his technical understanding of Ruby, and the tools it provides. Regardless of any faults in his technical understanding, his ability to work on a team and collaborate was really inspiring, and provided a way goal for myself to aspire to.

### Playing a Part

During the last six weeks I have been involved in all of the Friday activities including the hackathon. I am also a member of the hopper posse. Have been to productivity lunch.
