# Kris Sparks - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

##### A: End-of-Module Assessment  
1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment (did not have an assessment).
##### B: Individual Work & Projects
2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.  
##### C: Group Work & Projects  
3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.  
##### D: Community Participation  
3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above-and-beyond supports of the community.  
##### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback  
2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes in the feedback they receive.

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn the basics of programming, how to approach building a program, TTD and OOP. I set out to understand and improve work flow using terminal, text editor and Git.

### End of Module Assessment

I did not have an end of the module assessment.

### Work

I was assigned 2 individual projects and 1 pair project in this module. Each project was difficult for me conceptually and practically. I had a tough time getting starting, moving from one iteration to the next, and completing most of each project. I tried to learn as much as possible from each assignment. I started to understand each project near the time it was due.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beat is a project working with linked lists, which is a fundamental data structure in programming. Additionally, it was an introduction to the iterative process that involves using small functional pieces of programming that can, ideally, function independently. While I did not complete the project, I was a able to understand the concept of linked lists and begin writing some functional code.

* Only got through iteration 3. Recommend keep going.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma involved creating an encryption program, including generating keys and offsets. I got of to a quick, strong start, but failed to progress. I struggled with conceptualizing the encryption and with rotating arrays, something I still need to work on.

* making some progress but just need to do more stuff more quickly
* especially want to focus on the process portions and these initial steps in going from conceptual high level understanding into more specifically outlined small steps and designs that can be turned into implementation

* 6/16

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

This project involves creating a program that reads a Markdown file, parses the text, converts it to HTML and outputs html to another file. Conceptually this project was more accessible. I was able to generate some code independently. I started to understand how to write tests *before* writing code.

Jhun and I discussed areas to work on and next steps, including a follow up session with him.

## Team

### Projects

I was assigned one pair project. We we worked we together. It was helpful to pair with and learn from another Turing student.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/http_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

For this project we built a functional web server. We built a program to send and receive specific information. I put in a lot of time and effort, but didn't understand a lot of what we were doing.

* 13 tests, 17 assertions
* 95 percent coverage, could use more alternate path testing
* Some long methods, pull out code to methods to avoid unnecessary        variable assignment
* Pull out some methods to own class/modules
* 12/16

"Working with Kris was a good experience. He was very willing to work long and hard hours to help get the project done. He did decide to repeat the module a couple of days into the project, but did not check out mentally and offered to help however he could. Had very good ideas and was asking strong questions. He challenged my ideas and helped me have a better understanding of the project as a whole." - Parker

## Soft Skills and Protocol Requirements

1. I did not participate in the final project and do not have a DTR memo. I did not make one for my previous paring project.
2. [Project README](https://github.com/kbs5280/chisel/blob/master/README.md)
3. I had a paring session with Lovisa, but do not have written feedback. It was very early on in the module.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

The Turing student-community is very supportive, both emotionally and technically.  The support I received from other students is the only reason I made it through the first month.

### Being a Community Member

"Kris has been an integral part of my Turing experience. He has shown himself to be a kind and diligent student, and I have witnessed him often provide support to other students, myself included. He brings a wealth of experience, compassion, and perseverance to every endeavor, and I am glad that we are continuing on together!" - Sonia

### Playing a Part

Since I'm the first person here every morning, I make coffee almost every day. I don't know what could be more important than that.

I have made a concerted effort to be encouraging and supportive of other Module One students. I say something encouraging to at least a few people everyday. And I am always willing to help when I can.

I am an active participant in the Hopper posse. I've never missed a session and help when I can.

I am actively involved in the Impostors Lunch and Productivity Lunch.
