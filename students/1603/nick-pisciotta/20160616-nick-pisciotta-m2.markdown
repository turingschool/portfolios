# Nick Pisciotta - M2 Portfolio


### Areas of Emphasis
Develop a firm understanding of the Ruby language and the power behind object-oriented programming.  After learning the Rails framework and basic webpage styling, I hope to be able to produce a basic web application and understand the fundamentals of deploying a website to the web.

##### Notes:
* Rails pieces are looking really strong; able to move pretty comfortably around the stack
* Got a little tripped up on the problem design / outlining piece -- took us a little bit
to get back to the desired solution
* Don't forget to slow down and really read stack traces -- easy to get lulled into the automatic
habits of moving around a rails project
* Don't forget those enums!

#### Notes
* Developer understands rails I would like for some things to be a little more solid
* Encouraged developer to slow down and to make sure to read each error.
* Would benefit from a little more practice and debugging in free time.


### Work
  These are the following projects I completed for Module 2:

#### Little Shop

Project Partners: Anna Weisbrodt and Parker Phillips

* [Github URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/desk-nomad)

##### Notes
* Reset button for jQuery search parameters
* Focus on little details in design elements
* Clean up views a bit to remove logic
* Don't use inline styling
* App crashes when trying to send email message. Fix error before final grade.
* Think about class methods (Order.complete  Order.paid) in models to refactor from controllers. Then you can have instance variable in your views that reflect the query. The benefit is clarity and you declare what you want instead of asking for it.

### Community

#### Giving Feedback:

##### To Karina
* I greatly appreciate your spirit, willingness to learn, and ability to methodically work through some of the issues we’re having.  My frustrations for this project have been mounting for the past few days, partly due to our reluctance to make significant progress.  I feel that you can become fixated on minutia during certain times, when we may be in the midst of searching for a bug. Instead of focusing on how variables are named, other issues you are thinking of, or whatever stylistic things that may be happening, sometimes I feel we’re getting a little off track and just need to push through the spec and focus and finish the task at hand.

* You have been very communicative with me when you’re frustrated and have suggested adaptations and improvements to our group dynamic.  I notice that you get frustrated at certain times and walk away for periods of time, which I understand may be a coping mechanism of sorts, but is kind of a set back when we have to wait for you.  However, I want you to know that I am open to your suggestions and respect your ideas.  I apologize if I have displaced any of my frustrations with this project on you; I genuinely appreciate your attitude and all that you bring to the group

##### To Colin
* I have greatly appreciated your calm demeanor and encouragement working through this frustrating project.  You have been always eager to help and present at all times.  I feel that I may be driving too much, so definitely let me know if you feel like you’re not contributing enough.  I definitely don’t want to come across like my way is superior; I know you’re a strong programmer so let me know if you want to switch things up

##### To Parker
* I greatly enjoyed our time together working in little shop.  I felt that our group was able to make tremendous progress individually and collectively.  I am very impressed by the work you produced, and attribute a large portion of our success to all the hard work put in to this project.

* I’d like to see you take more initiative within a group, however.  You have a lot of great ideas and are a very strong programmer, so you should be able to accomplish a lot without any direction.  Have confidence in your work—don’t wait for direction—set your own expectations and goals and continue to challenge yourself without the need for gratification or acceptance from others.    

* All that you were able to accomplish was very impressive.  I have no doubt you’re going to continually impress me in the future.
##### To Anna

* You have done a great job as project manager for our little shop group.  You always ensured we had direction and kept us briefed on our current progress through many communication channels.  It is evident that your programming skills are advanced considering the code you produced and what you were able to achieve individually.  

* There may be times where you become very detail-oriented, something I do not fault you for, but I think it was the source of some stress/agitation in the final moments before client meetings.  

* I thought our group worked every well together, and I know that you contributed greatly to that cohesion.  Thank you for all that you did!


#### Receiving Feedback:

##### From Colin
* Working on Rush Hour with Nick has been the first time working with him before and it’s impressive to see his pragmatic response to learning and working through problems. Nick is a very strong programmer and is easy to work with. Maybe even a little to easy to work at times, possibly sacrificing direction and input by being too accommodating and not assertive enough. It’s hard to knock someone for being too flexible. But regardless having him in involved in the project is for sure an asset.

##### From Parker
* Nick is one of the hardest working people I have had the opportunity to work with. It’s clear that his work-ethic is spectacular. He is extremely excited to try new things, and doesn’t seem to ever shy away from an opportunity to learn something. This excitement can cause him to run into problems on occasion. Nick is extremely bright and he picks things up quickly (or so it seems). When you pair this with his willingness and excitement it can cause him to work very fast. This in itself is not a bad thing, however it can lead to minor details being glossed over. If Nick were to take a step back every once in a while to focus on the small things I think he would have an easier time overall and run into less issues. When he did encounter issues he was always patient and understanding, and demonstrated an innate ability to collaborate with his team members to overcome the obstacle. There was never a challenge that Nick faced that he couldn’t overcome, and those are qualities that I really admire about Nick. He is not just a talented programmer, but a genuinely pleasant person.

##### From Anna
* Nick - I really appreciate your enthusiasm for diving into the extensions and figuring out new things, and your diligence in following through on the problem-solving it sometimes took to get them working in the project. Our final product is more advanced because of your efforts. I think there were a few times when even more attention to testing (running tests frequently when making changes, discussing as a group anything unexpected), could have made our merges smoother. I’m happy with how it all came together, and with how much I learned in the process - hope you are too.


#### Playing a Part

* Paired with 1605 weekly
* I am a pre-work guide for1606
* Head LGBTuring
* Gave a lightning talk on storing data in DNA

### Soft Skills and Communication

#### Little Shop DTR with Anna and Parker
Project Manager: Anna

* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

 -  Nick: flexible, doesn't like to work late. Clear this weekend. Parker: ride leaves at 5:30 or 6. Weekends difficult to get to Turing. Anna: flexible, prefers not to work late. Also flexible weekends.


* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

 -  Communicate often - via Slack or otherwise. Check ins daily. Re-DTR near the end of this week.


* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

 * Difficult to know this early. Important to all learn at least basics of every feature.


* What does each group member hope to get out of the project?

 * All - solidify Rails knowledge.


* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

 * Waffle for project management. Someone else needs to review pull requests. All work on own branches. Merge pulls in person, if possible, especially for merge conflicts. Have development branch.


* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

 * Communicate with the group. Don't spend too much time stuck.


* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

 * Nick - just be open, forthcoming. Parker - be blunt, bring things up when they arise. Anna - same as above.


* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?
