### Areas of Emphasis
With little background in programming or computer science, I hope to better my understanding of the fundamental principles of programming to provide a sound foundation for future development of my skills.  I hope to gain a greater knowledge of Ruby, in particular, as well as how to develop algorithms to solve complicated problems.


### End of Module Assessment

### Individual Projects

These are the projects I have completed over this module.

#### *JungleBeats*

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/JungleBeats)
* [Project Spec ](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Exploring one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List.

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: "Speed and voice extension implemented"


* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

Feedback: More of the longer methods could be broken down into separate methods. Test more edge cases.  

#### *Enigma*

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/Enigma)
* [Project Spec ](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Using Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed By: Tess

Additional Feature: Chunks of six

Notes: Did additional feature, but didn't get to cracking. Nice break out of a cipher object to generate the hash map. Also nice breakout of the offset generator. Could refactor the encrypt/decrypt methods because they are doing the same thing.

###### Grading

* Overall Functionality : 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

Feedback: Find ways to break up larger methods.  Make use of private methods for recurring methods throughout a class

### Team Projects

#### *HTTPYYKM*

  Project Partner: Sonia Gupta

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/nickpisciotta/httpyykm)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Build a functional web server to gain a better understanding of HTTP

###### Grading

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

Feedback: 21 tests, one skipped.
Implemented up to iteration 4.
Look into using a Test helper file to remove redundancy from tests.
Some longer methods, look to pull out chunks of code into separate methods.
Look into when you don't need to instantiate a class and use a module instead or even class methods.
Some methods could have been broken out into separate classes/modules to improve organization.


#### *Black Thursday*

Project Partner: Charlie Kaminer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/black_thursday)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
* [README](https://github.com/ckaminer/black_thursday/blob/master/README.md)

Build a system that can load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Assessed By: Jhunbug

Repo: https://github.com/ckaminer/black_thursday

Notes: Code is refactored. They moved things into modules to move methods around. classes are pretty clean. No long methods.


###### Grading

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

###### DTR Notes
* Each member wants to be more comfortable working with large data sets and to focus on higher level applications and using that to assist in problem solving
* Our goals are to complete functional expectations and leave enough room to build our own feature.  We would like to finish with enough time for complete refactoring.
* We are available 2-3 hours after school everyday and over the weekend
* We will communicate via Slack, Screenheru.
* Charlie wants to work on TDD and I want to work on having objects communicate effectively.
* We will try to always start with TDD and think out loud
* Our agreed upon Git workflow is as such:
  * Charlie will for project and add me as a collaborator
  * Each team member creates own project branch
  * Don't work on master branch
  * Try to be effective with pull requests
* How we want feedback: Be up front, don't be afraid to speak your mind.

### Feedback to Me

From Charlie Kaminer:
  * It was a pleasure working on this project with Nick.  He was an attentive and encouraging partner throughout the entire process.  Nick maintained a strong commitment to working through our project piece by piece so that we didn’t ever  have to stay particularly late.  Our ability to bounce ideas off of each other and provide constructive feedback was a huge part of getting this project done in an efficient and timely manner

From Sonia Gupta:
  * I was lucky enough to partner with Nick on HTTP. Although I struggled profoundly with the project, Nick was always patient with me. He often stopped to explain what he was doing, and never admonished me for my lack of understanding. He was pretty much the ideal partner. Beyond that, Nick brings a positive attitude to his work and exhibits a phenomenal amount of fortitude when faced with problems he initially can’t solve. He is not afraid to ask for help, but he knows when to press forward on his own. His discipline will serve him well and I’m excited to see his progress.

### Community

#### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback To Sonia:
  * I had the opportunity of working together with Sonia on HTTPYYKM.  She showed remarkable perseverance throughout the course of the project, and was very communicative about her shortcomings on some of the topics.  She is undoubtedly ambitious, and her dedication to learning how to program will serve her well throughout her education. I have know doubt she will ascertain all the necessary skills to become a great developer.

###### Feedback to Charlie:
  * Charlie's strong understanding of programming and grasp of the material was evident throughout our time together working on Black Thursday.  He was very communicative throughout the entirety of the project, and would take time to explain any topics I was unsure of. His focus and dedication kept us on a good time frame, and we were able to complete a solid project with very few issues along the way.

#### Being a Community Member

  * Member of LGBTuring. Planned a breakfast for member during Week, and will be taking of the group starting next module. I hope to bring greater knowledge of the Denver LGBT community to Turing in future events.
