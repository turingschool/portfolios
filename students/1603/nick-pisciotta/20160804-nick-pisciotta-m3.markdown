# Nick Pisciotta - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

Continue to build on my understanding of the Ruby language and the power behind object-oriented programming, as well as the Rails framework, RESTful design, and MVC. I also would like to continue to explore the inner workings of the web and some more of the complicated aspects database queries with Active Record.

### Community

#### Feedback:

##### From Kerry

* You did a great job seeing the analytics through to produce something that  a meaningful stretch you and for the project, especially on the last day when our energy level was low.   We had a lot (A LOT) of CRUD and it was difficult to get that functionality complete, as well as testing (not to mention edge case testing). However, we all could have done a better job to get the full test suite working a bit earlier on in the project and use that to ensure that our tweaking did not break other things along the way.   You were great to work with and I really appreciate all of your contributions to the team.

##### From Marcella

*   Nick, you are a strong problem-solver and very hard worker. I want to compliment you on both your dependability and skill at efficiently finding answers to problems when you don't know immediately. Throughout the project, you consistently delivered on the objectives you said you would when you said you would, which also made for a smoother Pivot experience. It's hard for me to pick out something I think you need significant work on, since you were a great teammate overall, but there were moments that I felt you might get more comfortable with Git and Heroku deployment commands. Thank you for being an excellent teammate!

##### From Lucy  

*  It was a pleasure to work with Nick during Rails Engine. I appreciated the extra time he took to go above and beyond, especially the last night of our project when he spent extra time trying to fix spec harness failures we had and reduce them to as few as possible. This was certainly a challenging project and Nick was able to work efficiently in spite of the stress and short timeline that came with the project. While working with Nick I did notice that he spent a lot of time guessing for solutions on complex active record queries. He could work on improving his googling/search skills to try and make decisions based on documentation and less guess and check. Nick is a very strong developer and I believe that his skills will serve him well on the job. I look forward to seeing his work in the future.


#### Bezos (Bachman) Posse:

*  Our posse primarily revolves around the common  trends and issues facing the start-up community.  We have thorough discussions in student-led sessions on different weekly topics from articles written by industry leaders.  The group truly embodies the entrepreneurial spirit, and it has been great to discuss practical implementations of business models and have a break from coding.
