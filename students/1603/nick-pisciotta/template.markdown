### Projects

(Intro)

#### (JungleBeats)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/JungleBeats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this project we're going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, we're going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let's also use this project as a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List.

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Speed and voice extension implemented


1. Functional Expectations

4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project you'll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.
(evaluation comments)

Assessed By: Tess

Additional Feature: Chunks of six

Notes: Did additional feature, but didn't get to cracking. Nice break out of a cipher object to generate the hash map. Also nice breakout of the offset generator. Could refactor the encrypt/decrypt methods because they are doing the same thing.

1. Overall Functionality

2: Application is missing one of the three operations

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

(Feedback: Find ways to break up larger methods.  Make use of private methods for recurring methods throughout a class)

#### (HTTPYYKM)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/nickpisciotta/httpyykm)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

(21 tests, one skipped.
Implemented up to iteration 4.
Look into using a Test helper file to remove redundancy from tests.
Some longer methods, look to pull out chunks of code into separate methods.
Look into when you dont need to instantiate a class and use a module instead or even class methods.
Some methods could have been broken out into separate classes/modules to improve organization.)
