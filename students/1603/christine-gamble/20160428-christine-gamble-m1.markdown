# Christine Gamble - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module is to build a solid foundation so that I can confidently move on to module 2. Since this is the second time going through module 1, I want to use this extra time to fully understand these ruby concepts and practice these skills.

### Work

This module consisted of two individual projects (Jungle Beats and Enigma) and two partner projects (Hyde and Black Thursday).


#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](curriculum/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

(This project uses linked lists to make a drum machine. The learning goals are to practice breaking a program into logical components, distinguish between classes and instances of those classes, understand how linked lists work to store and find data, and test components in isolation and in combination.)

Assessed By: Horace
#### Notes:
* completed base expectations and 1 extension
* overall pretty clean and consistent linked list implementation
* looked at a few examples where test coverage could be improved around certain use cases
* talked about what it would look like to remove pre-counting and take count logic out of the other methods
* small hiccups around JungleBeat interface but these were pretty easy to straighten out

##### Scores:
- Functional Expectations - 4
- TDD- 3
- Encapsulation - 3
- Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3
- Looping & Recursion - 3


## Team

### Projects

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/hyde.git)
* [Original Assignment](curriculum/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

(In this project you'll build a "Static Site Generator" -- a system that allows the author to write content in a writing-friendly format (like Markdown), then the system generates HTML and puts it all together.)

##### Scores:
-	Functional Expectations – 3

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/black_thursday.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
* [DTR](black_thursday/DTR.txt)

(A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.)

## Community

### Giving Feedback
(To Lucy Fox): Lucy and I worked together on Black Thursday. She was a great partner to have for this project. We decided at the beginning that we wanted to focus on TDD, and throughout the project she made sure that we made this a priority. I was very impressed with her ability to think through everything logically and see the bigger picture. She took the time to map out the different components of the project, and this greatly helped us in later iterations. Her determination to work through challenges will certainly lead to success.


### Being a Community Member

(From Beth Sebian):
Christine has demonstrated a wonderful mix of professionalism, commitment, and curiosity during our work together in Pahlka posse. She rose early as our "maps" expert and has made an effort to help others in our group understand the mapping capabilities of our app. She's shown leadership by making recommendations about what mapping platform we should use. I also am very impressed by Christine's attitude -- she is active in our group, yet manages to engage in a relaxed and easy-going way. In that respect, I see her as a discreet leader whose done a lot to set a healthy tone for our group. She's been a huge asset to our team, and I expect she will continue to be of great service to others she works with.

(From Lucy Fox): Christine is my git hero! I've been struggling trying to nail down my git workflow and understand problems that arise with git. She has been unbelievably helpful in clarifying the git workflow process and helping us to overcome any merge conflicts during our Black Thursday project. I don't think I could've handled git quite as well without her helpful guidance and suggestions. I think Christine has very strong fundamentals in Ruby style and syntax and understands how to create amazing programs. I do hope that in future group projects Christine is more willing to speak up and experiment when she has one of her brilliant ideas. I think she has the potential to contribute amazing things while at Turing and I hope she remembers her talents while working on future projects and isn't afraid to try new things.

(From Jhun): I am really impressed with Chris's desire to write good code. It's been really cool for me to see her overcome some of the obstacles in her way. She's turned into a really great rubyist and someone I enjoy pairing with. She's really sweet and willing to work hard and make thoughtful contributions to the current challenge/codebase.

### Playing a Part
- I have continued to go to many of the Joan Clarke Society meetings and plan to continue attending meetings in the future.

- I am a part of LGBTuring and plan to go to future events. I appreciate that this group exists.

- I am a part of Mike's Secret Society, made up of the Mod 1 repeaters. We regularly get together to do extra challenges and have been a solid support group for each other throughout the module.

- I am a member of the Pahlka posse, which in my opinion is the best posse. We are a dedicated group of people focused on civic tech. We are currently working to develop an app that will help low-income residents in Denver find housing that best meets their needs. This [README](https://github.com/bethsebian/affordable-housing-app/blob/master/README.markdown) further describes our project. It has been especially rewarding for me to contribute my GIS skills to the project. I am excited to see this posse continue to do great things!
