# Parker Phillips - Module 1 Portfolio
=======================================
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
My main goal moving into this program is being confident in my ability of the basics of programming. I have no prior experience with programming, and not much more with the Mac operating system. Knowing the basics of the terminal, atom, and ruby language would propel me forward with enough confidence to succeed in future modules. I feel one of my strong suits as a person is problem solving, but I need improvement with breaking out of my shell and establishing relationships with other students and any mentors I will come into contact with.     

Looking back on the journey here I feel like I have achieved the goals I set out for myself. I feel like I have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of Ruby and how to implement them. I also believe that I have established relationships with fellow students both in and out of my cohort, as well as having two consistent mentors each week.     

What I would like to continue to improve on is the way I approach projects. I need to get stronger in writing tests before I write code as I have a tendency to write code and then test it. I would like to continue to use the basics of Ruby in future modules so I do not lose the knowledge I have gained during these last six weeks.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project we introduced HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and built a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

**Evaluation was completed by Mike Dao**        
* 13 tests, 17 assertions     
* 95 percent coverage, could use more alternate path testing     
* Some long methods, pull out code to methods to avoid unnecessary variable assignment     
* Pull out some methods to own class/modules

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project I used Ruby to build a tool for encrypting a message, decrypting a message,and cracking an encryption algorithm.

**Evaluation was completed by Horace Williams**    
* Overall very successful project -- completed base features as well as supporting feature and an extension     
* Seems to be doing pretty well with testing workflow -- classes are well-tested especially from a verification / functionality perspective     
* Looked at a few spots where some subtle improvements in naming could help clarify intent of the code a bit     
* Main improvement that stands out to be made would be extracting and reusing the duplicated code between the encrypt and decrypt classes -- when we see stuff like this look for a way to pull the similar code out into a new class and pass in some parameter that allows it to customize between the 2 different approaches

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this project I created a linked list, that when ran, would output a series of sounds in order.

**Evaluation was completed by Tess Griffin**     
Strong project. Recommened breaking out the while loop into it's own method to cut down on duplication.

-- I had the extension completed, but we did not pull from my github repository. As I did not like the functionality of the extension I deleted it locally.

## Team

#### Feedback From Me
##### HTTP - Kris Sparks     
“Working with Kris was a good experience. He was very willing to work long and hard hours to help get the project done. He did decide to repeat the module a couple of days into the project, but did not check out mentally and offered to help however he could. Had very good ideas and was asking strong questions. He challenged my ideas and helped me have a better understanding of the project as a whole"

##### Black Thursday - Lane Winham / Ryan Batty     
* Lane Winham: Working with Lane on Black Thursday gave me a better insight into his skills as a developer. He was very upfront early about his strengths and weaknesses to let me know where he was at. It was very obvious that one of his strongest areas of coding was being able to conceptualize what needed to be done; I know he is repeating the module to iron out his weaknesses, but it is exciting to see where he will go with his talents. It was also apparent how hungry Lane was to learn more. He was a patient partner, but was absorbing as much as he could. He didn't let setbacks get him down, and his drive and motivation is incredibly admirable.

* Ryan Batty: Working with Ryan was definitely a rewarding experience. Throughout the entire project I felt that he pushed to have things not just be good, but to constantly be improving upon them. I can definitely say I learned more about git and git workflow through all of our experimentation during this project than I had the rest of the module, and I was reluctant to try the new ideas.  Ryan wasn't hesitant however, the excitement he had for trying new things was very admirable. His skill as a coder is rapidly apparent when working with him, and it was a fantastic experience.

##### General Feedback
* Alex Navarrete: Alex Navarrete, you were the first person I met at Turing, and you were welcoming from the very beginning. If I had any questions about my pre work you were eager to help me out, and also explained more complex ideas. I still appreciate that so much. That persisted for the entire module. I know module 3 sounds like a beast, but the fact that you never shied away from helping me out or looking at my code was a blessing man. I really respect your work ethic, and personally don't feel like you give yourself enough credit. The knowledge that you have about coding is very impressive, everything that you've talked with me about has been clear, concise, and correct. Your willingness to tackle challenges is very admirable, I'm stoked to see where you take all of this drive, ambition, and talent, I think you'll go very far.

* Karina Gonzalez: I didn't work directly with Karina this module, but we did help each other throughout the entire process. Doing so gave me insight to  learn more about her. She is extremely excited about code, she seems to love the process of coding and is eager to tackle the next challenge. Her ambitions are also very admirable, she knows what she wants to do, and what she wants to accomplish, and isn't settling for anything less. I believe between her desire to constantly improve, excitement to face new challenges, and passion for coding will take her very far.

#### Feedback For Me

##### Feedback From Students
* Kris Sparks: Parker was great pair partner. He was accommodating and patient, and worked hard. He had some anxiety about getting started on each iteration, but once he had a handle on it he worked hard and fast. He’s not afraid to try things, change things and break his own code. He’s off to a solid start and will do well.

* Alex Navarrete: Its amazing how far you've come when we talk about programming since I remember sitting down with you for a while explaining how a loop method works in Ruby. As the weeks passed by it was cool seeing how you'd come up to me and tell me about how your projects have gone and the amazing scores you'd get with the work you have put in. Another thing I really enjoyed about you is how you'd always ask me questions and would be able to understand the advice I'd give you in return. I know without a doubt that you will really be a good programmer and enjoy the challenges that Turing provides. Keep me updated when your time comes to do your personal project, I'll look forward to it.

* Ryan Batty: Working with Parker presented a welcome personal challenge throughout the duration of our project. As a developer, he is definitely talented, and there was a constant pressure for both of us to help better the other. We maintained a very solid and fast development cycle and constant constructive feedback. While challenging, the fast pace and fun competition resulted in us finishing early and really coming away feeling confident about the code we wrote.

* Lane Winham: Working with Parker on the final project Black Thursday was a great experience. Coming into this project I felt very unsure of my skills and how to manage the workload but that didn’t seem to phase Parker in anyway. After only a few hours of working with him I was amazed at his level of comprehension of ruby fundamentals and workflow. We were able to verbally work through issues and create the starting framework of the project. Once we had a rough plan, Parker was able to take it and run with it with flawless execution. I am very curious to see how fast he excels during this program. Overall Parker was a great team member. He would always keep me in the loop and never hesitated to take a step backwards to explain in a manner that kept me up to speed.


##### Feedback From Instructors

* Jhun de Andres: I have really enjoyed working with Parker. I really appreciate his curiosity and confidence. He is a really strong partner and for me it's been really cool watching him grow into a solid rubyist who doesn't shy away from a challenge. I am really excited to see where he goes in his career as a software developer.

##### Playing a Part
During the module I attended all but one community day at Turing, I participated in outside events that I could attend, and attempted to help my posse with whatever project we were working on.     

In my two paired projects the group encountered roadblocks.      
In my first paired project my partner was lagging behind a little bit, but I did my best to accommodate that and help him understand the project. He did end up deciding to repeat the module a few days into the project, but maintained that I was a helpful partner for him.     
In my second paired project I was originally paired with Lane Winham, who at the beginning told me he was struggling with ruby fundamentals. With that in mind, as we were working on Black Thursday I did my best to make sure that he was understanding everything and getting as much as he could from the project. In addition to this, a fellow classmate Ryan had lost his partner and needed a group, Lane and I welcomed him and did our best to integrate the group together to work through the remaining portions of the project and explain to Ryan what all had been accomplished.     

The largest contribution I made in my eyes, was staying at Turing beyond the time I needed to complete my projects and help students that were still working. On all projects I finished early the day before it was due, but instead of capitalizing on that free time for my own benefit, I used the time as an opportunity to help other students that were still working on the project. I stayed late to help them with whatever last challenges they were facing, be it refactoring, working on final iterations, or just general problems.
