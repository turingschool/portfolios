# Parker Phillips - Module 3 Portfolio
=======================================
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
My main goal moving into this Module is being able to effectively consume an API and possibly even create my own. I'm looking forward to my personal project and am excited to see what skills I have at that time to make something I'm proud of.

Looking back on the journey here I feel like I have achieved the goals I set out for myself in regards to ability. I am disappointed in my personal project with where it stands right now however. It isn't where I want it to be, and I plan to continue working on it after the module. There were outstanding circumstances with this project, but I am still disappointed in the result I produced in the given time. I do feel like I have a strong understanding of consuming an API as well as building an API, in addition to some smaller skills such as caching. I prioritized functionality this module instead of testing/styling as those were some of my weaker points in previous modules. Overall I am happy with my experience, but I would like to work on balancing testing/features/styling balance during a project.

### Work

This is a collection of all projects attempted during Module 3

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Taking our first brownfield project, we were assigned the task of taking a single tenancy site, and shifting it to support multi-tenancy functionality.

**Evaluation was completed by Nate Allen**        
* Some bugs
* Some less than smooth user flows. I have to go back to my dashboard to add another item. And I can filter by a category that I'm not viewing.     
* Blink Blink Blink
* Other ways you can do things, but no big red flags in your code.      
* Look into Presenters for thinner controllers
* Don't be afraid to use JS libraries, as you learn more JS
* Experiment more. Moar functionality. Moar technology. Moar features.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

A business is only as smart as its data. Rails Engine was our opportunity to build an API that contained endpoints with data that was the result of complicated ActiveRecord Queries.

**Evaluation was completed by Nate Allen**        
* What up with no tests? tests were abandoned partially because test coverage was really good on the pivot at the cost of features, and I pushed them to do more features in future projects
* Good work not using enumerables in BI queries
* Good use of formatting data on intake and presentation
* Some inconsistencies in active record, but still pretty Good
* Could use scopes for common where, like successful Transactions
* Talked about how jBuilder is the one true customizer, but good use of serializers

#### SubSpace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/sub-space)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

This was my first opportunity to build a project that I had thought of. The concept of it is a website that allows you to log in with google, consumes your youtube subscriptions, and allows you to categorize them.     
Overall I am disappointed in the result as of Thursday, I did not get as far as I would have liked, but I will continue to work on this beyond module 3.

**Evaluation was completed by Josh Mejia**    
* Javascript was not where we wanted it
* AJAX was a good feature
* Not enough features to warrant a success
* Needed the features to be finished faster, overcome those obstacles quicker
* Break out the subscription calling the API into a seperate "SubscriptionGenerator" class
* Make sure to add rails to the simplecov tag and use the coverage to see test weaknesses

##### Feedback From Students
* Ilana: Parker was a valuable group member in the pivot. He jumped right into the front end work, which not a lot of people want to take on, and was able to excel at it. Parker is very eager and sometimes that can work against him. I feel that sometimes when Parker hears feedback from a group member, he does not always internalize it or sound like he is listening and taking in the feedback. Overall, Parker is always willing to jump into the hard parts of a project and that is always appreciated.

* Colin: Working with Parker was really fun. I felt like he always had a great attitude, even when we were neck deep in docs neither of us really understood. He works very hard and is very quick to pick things up and even quicker on implementation. I enjoyed learning Jquery with him and also some JavaScript pieces. On the downside, he may not always be on the exact same page as some other group members/ ie in difficult or number of tasks. I think he's eager to take on a lot and work at his pace, it just may be harder when coming together with other group members. Overall I would be happy working with Parker again since he was so eager to try new things, and his CSS/styling skills are exceptional. I learned a lot from him and still could.

* Robbie: Parker was a great group member to have for the Pivot. He was always eager to take on the next task, and his energy was high enough to keep the group's energy high. Parker's technical skills are definitely strong. I have no doubt that Parker can handle any technical challenge you throw at him given enough time - he has great perseverance. One thing Parker can work on is continuing to communicate to other group members when there are changes that affect others. Pair coding is a good example of this. Communication while you're changing code and reasons why are really important. That being said, Parker is always open to talk about changes if you ask him. Also, our CSS customization was a huge task that Parker took on without hesitation, which was a big boost for the group. I hope I get to work with Parker again on future projects.

##### Feedback From Me
* Robbie: You were a fantastic partner, I had been wanting to work with you since mod 1 and am glad we were finally able to. Your technical skills are apparent, and I admire your ability to stay calm in stressful situations. I wish we could've paired a little bit more, but dividing and conquering worked out really well for us. I feel like you aren't necessarily utilizing your technical skills to the best of the abilities in the form of sharing opinions about the direction the project should go. You dissect the problems we are facing very fast, but sometimes seem hesitant to take charge. Your opinions are incredibly valuable to the group, and I always value hearing them. I know you say you are not a leader, but you strike me as someone who could be very successful in a leadership role if given the opportunity.

* Colin: Working with you was a blast, I really enjoyed our pairing on the last couple of features the last few days. You are one of the most easy going people I have met, and in the thick of the pivot that mentality is a breath of fresh air. Sometimes being that easy going can turn against you though. A couple of times when we were discussing what we wanted to work on we didn't hear much from you. I know you are more than competent enough to tackle any of the tasks that were at hand, but being easy going I feel like you were waiting for people to ask you to do something instead of volunteering. With the right personality fit I imagine this working perfectly in certain groups, however our group was hesitant to ask others to do something. It would have been nice to hear your opinion more often during those times. All in all I sincerely enjoyed working with you, and I hope we have another opportunity to do so.

* Ilana: working with you was my first opportunity to see that you a much stronger than you lead on. I have been in many of the imposter lunches with you, but had never been given the opportunity to code with you. I understand the lack of confidence feeling, but believe people when they tell you that you are a strong developer. Any task that we gave you during this project you accomplished well and in a timely manner. I was impressed with what we all saw from you. I feel you do have a tendency to get a little caught up on the smaller parts - and that might be stemming from my own fight to avoid doing that - instead of focusing on the grand scheme going on in the midst of the project. You are much stronger then you feel, and it will be exciting to see the bigger things you produce.

##### Playing a Part
During the module I Co-led the Miyamoto posse with Ryan. This was a good challenge balancing the work from the posse with the work of the module. In addition to this I tried to help out fellow students whenever I could. In addition to these contributions I also helped teach the CLI students on our Friday.
