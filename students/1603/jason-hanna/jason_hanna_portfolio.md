# Jason Hanna - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My name is Jason Hanna. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. I've told you my name: that's the Who. The Where could most readily be described as a prison cell. But there's a vast difference between being stuck in a basement with no windows and being in prison. The What is hard: recently I planned and set in motion events to learn Web Development and Software Design. That's also the When. As for the Why: beyond the obvious financial motivation, it's exceedingly simple... because I want to. Which leaves us only with the How; and therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

### End of Module Assessment

I did not participate in the End of Module Assessment

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/jungle_beats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/71ca0d64df95cb8ed07d26915159c972780f10de/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this three day project, I built a singly Linked List in order to make a very basic drum machine program.

Assessed By: Mike
Notes:
* 25 tests, in the future place in lib/ and test/ directories
* watch for edge cases, and organize tests along what theyre testing
* to_string depended on array functionality
* methods were pretty atomic
*  Watch for unnecessary variable assignment


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/enigma.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project, I attempted to create a program that would generate a key, an offset, and that can encrpyt/decrypt a file.

Assessed By: Nate

Additional Feature: None

Notes:

- Style looks good
- Class structure seems good
- Functionality just isnt there
- Work on application of ruby concepts to the real problems
- The problem makes sense, and the ruby makes sense. Just need to connect them.


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations
* **1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage**

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* **1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD**

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* **3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities**
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together


#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/chisel.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project, I am making a parser that will convert Markdown to HTML

### Projects

I did not participate in any group projects in this module.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Ryan Batty - Ryan is very knowledgable of Ruby and has a great logical way of tackling problems. He has guided me through many problems in a very patient, deliberate manner. He was always easy to work with. Communication was great and he great at giving me feedback that was always helpful.

Lane Winham - Lane's easy going attitude and ability to roll with the punches made working with him a blast, even during the most stressful of times. Though we didn't have any projects together, Lane is a great person to bounce ideas off of and get encouragement to explore ideas. During in class assignments, he was a great partner always willing to play whatever role suited the group best.

Sonia Gupta - Sonia has been an incredibly wonderful person to go through this module with. Her patience, humor, and spirit has made getting through the more difficult parts of this module easier. She's always composed and supportive, and always willing to help in any way she can. I look forward to working with her in the next module, and I think her experience will be a great asset to everyone in the class.

### Being a Community Member

Sonia Gupta - Jason and I have gotten to know each other better recently as we’ve both decided to repeat the module. He has shown an incredible amount of resilience in the face of adversity, and I admire his ability to take things in stride. He never complains, and he really just puts his head down and does the work. He has a kind nature and an optimistic outlook that is wonderfully contagious. I’m glad that he will be part of 1605, and I think that his refusal to give up will continue to serve him well.

Ryan Batty - The time I had working with Jason was limited, though I did have the opportunity to do so on a number of in-class assignments. That said, whenever we worked together I found his easy-going attitude very easy to get along with, and our assignments went smoothly. Outside of coursework though I got to know Jason quite well. He was always very supportive when it came to others, and definitely the first to offer help if he could.

Lane Winham - Jason and I did not have the opportunity to be partners on a project. However, we had worked along side one another many times throughout the module. During these interactions he and I shared a common mindset in how we would like to progress through module 1. That being said we both had plenty of struggles and set backs but that did not keep Jason from forging ahead and working on his personal success. I look forward to spending more time in the dungeon with you!


### Playing a Part

I was an active member of Hopper Posse, and participated in Imposter lunch, Productivity lunch weekly. I honestly engaged in Gear-Ups and I have also signed up for an elective every week.
