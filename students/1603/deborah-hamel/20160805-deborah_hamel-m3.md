___
### Areas of Emphasis
* Be able to make a fully functioning app independently
* Work on speed and experiment with coding approaches
* Work on testing skills as process and approach

## __Self-Assessment__
---

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

**3** : Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates that skill across a variety of work.

**3** : Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.


### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

**4**: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.


### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

**4** : Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

**4** : Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback to shape their own character and behavior.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Nate

Notes:

* Internal API tests are headed in the right direction. Some confusion about how to use rspec and factorygirl
* Good work having feature and unit level tests
* Tests should cover more of the user story
* Tests that hit the API should use VCR
* To make internal API work, just needed to fix a couple typos. How could you have found those typos?
* Service is well broken out, exemplary even


## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

#### Ruby Style - 4
#### Rails Syntax & API - 3
#### Testing - 2
#### Progression/Completion - 2
#### Workflow - 4


### Attendance
100%

##### Personal Project: What's your tweetitude?

Tweetitudes is an app for analyzing the sentiment of tweets. In brief, Tweetitudes allows users to bring back latest tweets, analyze and report if the sentiment of each tweet is "Positive" or "Negative" based on scoring from the Mashape Tweet Sentiment Analysis API.

Project Partners: Charles, Ryan, Jenny

Assessed by: Nate


Notes:
- Some UI things. Not really polished enough. Flash messages got swallowed. Some unintuitive redirects.
- Long conversation about testing. Coverage helps you find the things you're missing. The tests you've written provide good value for the things they're testing. TDD feels unnatural for you, so keep experimenting. Find your inner TDD.
- Could use scopes. Active is the only reasonable default scope, but listen to whatever your boss tells you.
- Look into decorators if you like. Josh likes Presenters.


### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion - 4**

**2. Organization - 4**

**3. Git Workflow - 3**

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development - 2**

**2. Code Quality - 3**

### Product Experience

#### Feedback to Me

**Project Partners' feedback**

* Charles | The Pivot:

> Deb, it was a pleasure to get to know you and work with you during the last two weeks. Pivot is a big project that can drain people physically, mentally, and emotionally. Your unwavering support through the entire process was great for team morale and always kept me from getting too frustrated with something. Your eagerness to learn is inspiring. I do however think it would benefit you to do more independent work at times to go through the full learning experience of not knowing something and teaching yourself rather than just learning through observation. I'm sure coming back from a mod off is hard but I know that I learn a lot when I am alone in the trenches and forced to teach myself things and think you would benefit from this. I think if you generally assert yourself into the project more you can make your ideas and hard work heard as well as take back that learning process. Thank you for being the rock of our group these last two weeks, it made a huge difference in my pivot experience.

* Ryan| The Pivot:

> Deb! Being a completely new addition to 1603, I did not know what to expect when I found out we were assigned to the same group. That said, I am happy to say I had nothing to worry about! Your constant optimism and positive attitude were a breath of fresh air during the ongoing and ever-increasing stress of The Pivot. In the future though I would recommend really pushing yourself to tackle some things on your own. When pairing you shine, but alone I noticed you had trouble figuring out how to proceed. Perhaps really push yourself for the extensions on APICurious to prepare for the Personal Project.

* Jenny | The Pivot:

>You did a good job with group morale because you uplifted the group and put everyone in good spirits, but you could speak up and take more leadership in order to be heard and appreciated. Not to say that I don't appreciate you, just that you often have valid views but are too doubtful with yourself.

**Feedback from peers outside of team projects**

* Ling, 1511

Deb, you are an integral member of the Turing community. A few days ago, we paired for hours in the evening on building and consuming APIs. You have exhibited noticeable growth in your own confidence and have stopped questioning what you know less. I am glad we got to develop a concrete technique to help hone in on how to improve your technical skills because I think you have a good grasp of the other psychological factors. One noticeable thing you can do to work faster is improving your work flow! Spectacle can be awesome. (^o^) All of these are things we discussed. I am so proud of you! Thinking about how we met through Girl Develop It in Classroom B, it's amazing how life brings people together. I hope you continue on this path and we will definitely keep in touch.



### Giving Feedback
** Project partners' feedback**

* Charlie | The Pivot:
>I loved working with you Charlie. You did a great job with balancing being extremely personally productive and supporting/encouraging the productivity of every member of the team, whether with your artful and amiable soft skills, or when needed, technical heroics that solved any challenge we faced in the code. I personally appreciated the value you placed on collaborative problem solving and pairing.You could be less humble and more demanding of others in order to keep everyone on their toes. Pairing with you was the most enjoyable and valuable time I spent on this project.


* Ryan | The Pivot:

>You did a good job with so many moving parts as our project manager. Our gitflow and communications about contributing code kept our code base moving forward in a healthy way that also allowed everyone to contribute throughout the project. Thank you so much. There were a few times we seem to miscommunicate about the group meeting up, so maybe more clarity and specifics about meetings and check in times would have been good.


* Ling | Pairing
>Ling, you are one of strongest and most productive programmers at Turing. You have been one of my most influential supporters and you have made me a stronger a more confident programmer with  advice, pairing and friendship. Your heart is big, brave and beautiful. Try not to over analyze yourself. Canâ€™t wait to see the amazing things you will to as a developer.
