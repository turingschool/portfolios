# Sally MacNicholas - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to come out having a better understanding of Rails, 
and the object model. I wanted to learn how to write cleaner code as well
and I believe that I have accomplished this. All I've ever wanted was to
get a 4 for code quality from Horace, and I finally did it! Hooray!

### End of Module Assessment

* Completion: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* User Experience: 4
* Organization: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Performance: 1

Notes:
* Code quality is quite good; getting pretty competent at OO barrier identification and extracting pieces of the system
* View layer also is exceptionally clean
* Good job on extracting logic into small methods etc
* Testing needs lots of work
* Even the tests we do have don't really get into the material important parts of the app
* External service interactions are untouched in the tests. Need some stubs or at least use of VCR


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of
excused absences on the morning of Monday, July 6,
all day on Friday, July 17, and afternoon of Thursday, July 30.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Bettergram - API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/bettergram)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

This project was to learn how to consume an API. I chose the instagram site to clone.
While I was successful at cloning the site, I also made a UI/UX tweak one of the main pages.

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Features: 4
* Interface: 4

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team project:
  
#### Supper Skip (Eatsy)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

The goal of this project was to adapt an existing data model and flexibly serve multiple tenants,
while maintaining a robust permission model to keep tenants' data secure and isolated
from other tenants.

Notes:
* Good on several fronts -- test coverage, some use of ruby service objects, solid data modeling, looks ok. 
* Would like to see more model/unit testing and more use of PORO's.
* Also my photo is somewhat low res.

Scores:
* Feature Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 4


## Community

### Giving Feedback

From others:
* You're the best Sally. =) You're very social and make every single person feel involved in whatever we are working on. I hope that we can work together on a project in Module 4.
* Sally has an outstanding work ethic, and excels on most of the projects she is assigned to. She genuinely cares not just about contributing, but also about the learning process involved. She picks up concepts quickly, and her understanding of front-end development rivals that of the leading students in 1503.
* You have a great balance of personality, and work ethic, and you make everyone feel comfortable and welcome.
* Thanks for showing me haml and your design secrets!

From myself:
* I tried to fill out every Friday survey as accurately as possible.
* I have filled out peer surveys when they have been sent out for feedback.
* Organization skills need work - Instead of staying in my head, I need to actively use waffle or trello from start to finish or at the very least, pen and paper.
* My testing scores have been consistently low this module. My goal is to go back through this module's projects and get my testing where it needs to be at.

### Playing a Part

* TA two class sessions for GDI Denver
* Mentored high school students for JeffCO Coding camp for two days
* Helped pick up breakfast one Friday with Max and Brett
* Helped a few sales engine groups with installing simplecov and debugging
* Had coffee with someone who was struggling
* Continually tried to reach out to others in lower cohorts to see if they needed help
  with projects and helped when needed, even if it meant putting my projects on hold
