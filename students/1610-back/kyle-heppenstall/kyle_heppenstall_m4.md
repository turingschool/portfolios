# A: End of Module Assessment - Rubric

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

_You're leveraging partials, before actions and other clean Rails features. You've worked to push logic down the stack. I suggest adding a more realistic path to your "Mark as Read" and "Mark as Unread" link helpers to begin to address what happens when a user doesn't have JS enabled. To improve to a 4, update the path associated with the link helpers just mentioned and continue writing clean code while implementing the remaining features requested. Did not implement_

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms.** Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

_Your JS is well-organized and follows common conventions. It also leverages some OO principles._

### 4. Testing

* **4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

_Your tests are well-organized and structured. To improve your score, I'd like to see tests for your API controller._

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

_It's clear that you've thought about your user interface. To improve your score here, I encourage to do even more formatting and styling._

### 6. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

# B: Indepenent Work

## [Open Source Contribution](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/257c83b82160c312bd89899277c2cc6b)

Blog post links to the criteria. I did 3 bug reports and did not do any documentation since the [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) documentation is excellent.

# C: Group Work

## Quantified Self Week 1

On this project I worked with Jesse. We built up our jQuery skills and started testing with javascript for the first time. We became much more familiar with how to organize our javascript code and handle events with javascript.

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

### Testing

- **4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.**
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.
- 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

### JS syntax and Style

- **4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate**
- 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**
- 3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

### Project Management

- **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.**
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### Risk Taking

Adhering to any of these additional specifications will allow you to increase one score above:

- All functionality is part of a class, written using ES6
- No Libraries (except for testing). All JavaScript functionality is your own.

## Quantified Self Week 2

- The documentation for both repos is really thorough! ðŸŽ‰ 
- Lots of small methods.
- Nice separation of responsibility.
- It seems like you both accomplished the goals of CRUD with AJAX so nice work!

## D: Feedback and Community

Co-lead the Automation Gear-Up Session. Our first two gear-ups were spent planning and then we implemented our plan for the final gear-up. Overall this was a great experience and I'd recommend doing it to upcoming mod 4 students. See [PR](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/pull/24).
