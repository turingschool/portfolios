# Marisa Burton - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?
In this module, I wanted to learn how to comfortably develop basic web apps and learn how to test for things that show up on pages. Before this module, I didn’t fully grasp exactly what a database was, and six weeks later, I can write code for authorizations and authentications. Professionally, I wanted to focus on giving and receiving constructive feedback while learning to be more comfortable cold contacting and networking to the point where it no longer fills me with anxiety.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 2: Developer demonstrates some gaps in understanding when asked for additional detail

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### Bike Share (https://github.com/Sh1pley/bike-share)
Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills base expectations

ActiveRecord
3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

User Experience and Conventions
4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

Code Organization/Quality
3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

Testing
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

Working Collaboratively
4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### Little Shop (https://github.com/cews7/little_shop) 

### Individual Projects

#### Job-Tracker (https://github.com/MarisaMBurton/job-tracker) 
hey @MarisaMBurton - overall, i think this looks pretty good. i don't see the functionality for the dashboard/analysis methods, but your CRUD looks good. be sure to handle your errors.
Database, Relationships, and Migrations
4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.
Routes
3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.
Controllers
2: Significant logic exists in the controllers. Methods may be more complicated than necessary. Most functionality is still supported.
ActiveRecord
1.5: The developer may be calling on other classes in models (e.g. Category.where(title: title)), and may struggle to explain choices they made in implementing some functionality.
1.5: Significant functionality is missing. The developer seems to not understand the methods that ActiveRecord makes available.
Views
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
User Experience
3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.
Testing
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions
I really enjoyed this gear up and I think my group had good and honest conversations. However, I felt that some of the examples we read were more overt racism than microaggressions, but I hope it opened up people’s minds. I think those who don’t experience microaggressions don’t know that they exist. I hope that people’s assumptions change and we are more aware of the words and terms we use, as I think sexism and racism is so ingrained in our culture and language. 

#### Journey Mapping
This gear up was really helpful. I liked the analytical aspect of it, as it takes things in steps and makes me focus on how to design things better from the user standpoint. I hope to use this journey mapping more once I do get a job.

#### Grit
I think grit is more of a buzzword than anything else, as I didn’t agree in the way in which “grit” was studied, as it solely focused on school performance and testing. Furthermore, if you are passionate about something and love something, it doesn’t take “grit” to succeed, as you already love it so don’t need to persevere. Grit to me is persevering despite the fact that things are extremely difficult and you are in duress. I liked how we were in our cohort so we could have a more open and honest conversation.


### Professional Development Workshops
As for project management strategies, we followed the rubric and talked about expectations for workflow, how we work best, and set goals and expectations. In our retro, we spoke about how we met or didn’t meet those expectations. Both times I worked in a group, I lucked out with a project manager who had strong organizational skills and kept us on track. I personally like pairing and learn a lot from pairing, so I was happy to express this, making me ending up learning a lot from completing these projects.

#### Finding New Opportunities
I enjoyed this workshop, as after it I felt confident using MeetUp and LinkedIn to network. I’m always nervous about networking as it causes me some anxiety, but this talk gave me more confidence and actually got me a bit excited about starting my first tech job search. It sounds daunting at first, but I know eventually I’ll be OK.

As for feedback, I’m working on being more confident with my coding skills and taking on things on my own without fear of making mistakes. I try to work through problems on my own now before I ask for help, and am now trying to pair less to work through problems myself to better understand what I’m doing.

#### Collaborative Communication
I found the reading and talk interesting. It made me think about how I as a team member, whether project manager or not, can work to bring out the best in my team and keep them motivated. I’ve worked in places before with bad leadership and management, and this poor leadership lead to low morale and reduced productivity. Positive feedback and asking people what works for them is vital to productivity. 

#### Feedback II
I enjoyed the Johari Window technique. I learned that I can be introverted and shy at times, so people don’t really know me or see me the way I may want them to see me. I’m working more on coming out of my shell a bit and expressing different sides of my personality, so people don’t think that I’m just the quiet type.

#### Cold Outreach
I never really knew how to contact people like this, and this class really helped. It makes my messages to them simple and direct and to the point, while relating to them in some way. Although I am sometimes shy about networking and meeting new people, this process is not overly stressful and I know it’s a necessity for me to find a job once I complete Turing. ‘

#### Networking Class
I really enjoyed this class and meeting people from the front end. I also found another Peace Corps volunteer so we ended up striking up a conversation. I’m usually intimated to speak to people I don’t know, but it gave me hope that there’s common ground and we could have something in common to talk about.

####Networking
I cold contacted:
1. Adrian Chen at Ibotta
2. Clayton Bailey at Civicore
3. Rich Shea at Wombat Security Technologies
4. Lydia Shafer at Wombat Security Technologies
5. Christopher Soden at Cognizant
6. Ryan Johnson at CaptainU
7. Toni Rib at GoSpotCheck

I received four responses and met with three of the contacts.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

####Feedback to Lazlo Balogh:
Lazlo was such a pleasure to work with. He just seems to understand programming so naturally, and he’s a great and patient teacher. He is the main reason why we did so well in this project as he was our main foundation. He quickly walked me through errors I was having and explained things so I could quickly understand my problem and keep working. I really appreciate the time he spent working with me as he really made me feel a part of the team. I learned a lot on this project, and a good reason for that is due to Lazlo.

####Feedback to Jesse Shipley:
Jesse was so much fun to work with. He was so hardworking and focused on learning and finishing the difficult iterations we handed off to him. Jesse is such a team player, and is a quick, analytical learner. Even when we are stressed, he is always there to crack a joke and make everyone feel a little more relaxed. He is great at showing support, appreciation, and open to asking for help when he needs it. I really enjoyed working with and would work with him again.

####Feedback to Annie Wolff:
Annie was a pleasure to work with. She is both quick-witted and is a quick learner. Annie was a major force and foundation in our team. We wouldn’t have finished the project without her major contributions. I was very appreciative of her walking me through the steps of design, and she took the time to explain things to me when I was having trouble. I really enjoyed working on the final iteration with her, as she made it look so easy when other people were struggling. She was always reminding us to smile even when we felt a bit overworked and tired, and that helped lighten up the atmosphere.

####Feedback to Jason Conrad:
Jason was a pleasure to work with on Little Shop. He is a hard worker and is amazing at debugging and solving some of our tougher problems. We paired together on some of the cards, and I learned a lot working with him. Jason was a pleasure to work with, always cracking jokes and making coding fun. I really enjoyed multi-tasking and discussing football with him while taking a break from a debugging issue we were having. 

####Feedback to Eric Wahlgren-Sauro:
I really enjoyed working with Eric on Little Shop. He perseveres and is great to pair with and work through a problem together. Eric is always focused on completing a task until it’s completed, and he knows when to ask for help when he needs it. Eric knows a lot more than he thinks he does, and I hope he will be more confident with coding in the future.

####Feedback to Molly Brown:
Molly was a pleasure to work with in Little Shop. She did an amazing job coding a large portion of the front-end, and is extremely focused and hard-working. She always volunteered to take on the difficult tasks of the project and was an active team member helping us debug and work through some of the problems we encountered. She was a valuable member of our team and we couldn’t have finished the project without her. 

####Feedback from Lazlo Balogh:
I am glad we were able to pair finally on the Bike-Share project together and get to know you a bit more.
Behind the mask of a quiet person is a bright future programmer who is always open to learning one who can learn fast. You wanted to help the team to succeed and always looked for ways to contribute. You might not be a loudest member of the team, but  still a fighter.
I also loved that you were not afraid of asking questions when you had to. That is a difficult thing to do as we all try to balance pride vs keep making progress through the development.

Positive highlight:
You seem to pick up on details very quickly. You handle your tools well and when we talk through new concepts, you understand it very quickly.

Actionable item:
Have more self confidence and never be afraid of trying things on your own. In your own development environment the worst that can happen is an error message.

####Feedback from Jesse Shipley:
Marisa was a great group partner on our Bike Share project. As a group we were all 
very new to building a functioning web app, with a user experience. Inspite of all
the new ideas and concepts, Marisa really dove in and tackled many aspects that were
foreign to us. Through all of her hard work, she was an outstanding communicator and
great to work with. 

I found her sense of humor, and genuine love for programming really set a mindset
with us all, that this was a project we could be proud of. I would
welcome the opportunity to work with Marisa again in a future project. Her 
attitude, focus and want for success really was important to group moral and 
the pride we all had in the end product.

####Feedback from Eric Wahlgren-Sauro:
Marisa carried a can-do-attitude on every step of Little-Shop. We often would pair together over screenhero and be equally lost in what to do next and right when I would be tempted to justify taking a break, she'd perk up with an idea on how to solve the current issue. She is smart, but often unsure of herself. While this isn't untrue of many Turing students, she sometimes comes across as being too hard on herself at times. She frequently verbally represented, how I was feeling on the inside as we worked through problems together. She's a hard worker and a fun teammate. She loves George Michael!

####Feedback from Jason Conrad:
I had the chance to work with Marisa on Little Shop. From the beginning 
I saw how willing she was to put in the work and dive in to things that
we had little experience with. She and I spent probably 5+ hours on Screenhero
during our "Remote Day" researching and trying to figure out how to set up
the cart. She was always more than willing to take things on and make sure that
they got done (which with a project that has as much in it as Little Shop had
was always greatly appreciated) When stresses would be high where tempers 
might normally flare she always kept cool (singing George Michael's Careless
Whisper as her calming mantra when we were trying to avoid a large 'Git'tastrophe.
I would definitely work with Marisa on a project again

####Feedback from Annie Wolff:
Marisa is someone I care deeply about. She is someone who gives back to the community consistently and who takes her role as a group member seriously. She never fails to ask questions when she is not confident in a topic and truly listens to and learns from your answer. Beyond this, she cares deeply about the learning and experience of every member in the group. She is a model community member who I look to for leadership and friendship.
Actionable: Don't let yourself be frustrated when bugs and errors pop up. You've got the tools and the knowledge to solve any problem.

####Feedback from Molly Brown:
Marisa was a super versatile member of our team. She helped get authorization up and running on our site, contributed to the styling and layout, and contributed an impressive number of tests to our test suite. I really appreciated the fact that she asked lots of questions when she was unclear on things as it prompted me to stop and think about the same. I also apprciated her willingness to jump in and offer help to everyone on the team with whatever they were working on at the current moment. Above all I resepected her efforts to push herself outside of her comfort zone and gain exposure to working on every aspect of our site, which is probably the most important habit for a developer to have.


### Being a Community Member
I am a Student Advisory Board member and I pair at least once a week and try to help people with their questions when I can.

## E: Community Participation

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?
I try to be as helpful as I can to other students when they are stuck, and I try to pair at least once or twice a week. I just overall try to be an understanding and empathetic person, and as an SAB member, try to represent my module as best as possible.
