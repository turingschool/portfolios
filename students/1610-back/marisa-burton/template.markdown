## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module?

When I first began, I didn't know what I didn't know, but I knew I wanted to strengthen my logical skills and build a good foundation with Ruby and object oriented-programming. Whereas the logic part is quite simple for me, I needed to become more comfortable with testing, and have spent a lot of time throughout this module to become more comfortable with TDD. I'd  like to work more on how objects interact with each other.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### Ruby Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
#### Completion and Progress
3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.
#### Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
#### Workflow
3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
#### Collaboration
4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
#### Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module, I worked on the following individual projects: Mastermind.

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/MarisaMBurton/mastermind
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown


Build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface. TDD is important.

I personally struggled with TDD and how to organize this project, as it was my first. Now I'm getting a better understanding of TDD and how to properly build and use classes.

Notes:

-didn't make use of strong TDD
-a lot was inside the mastermind class, think about what and how you could put things into separate classes When thinking about how to divide things into separate classes, name things that the class does in english whenever you use "and" that's probably a good sign you can pull it out. Example, the mastermind class has the things you print out to the screen AND checks the inputs from the user AND ... etc etc
-Methods created to check user input were great
Score:

#### Test-Driven Development: 
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
#### REPL Interface and Game Functionality
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec
#### Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
#### Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following projects were completed with a partner: Nightwriter & Black Thursday.

#### NightWriter

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/NightWriter
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown
* DTR: https://gist.github.com/Robbie-Smith/b5e3eaf605c04b9273cb04248089e236

Write a program that converts a braille text to English and an English text to braille.

Notes:

Rake test file
26 tests 749 assertions
100 percent test coverage
used in enumerables in test
Recursive approach was super cool
Read and write are separated, might belong together in a single class/module/thing
try to have methods take arguments instead of reading an instance variable
Scores:

#### Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases
#### Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
#### Overall Functionality
3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension


#### Black Thursday

* https://github.com/drod1000/black_thursday
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown
* DTR: https://gist.github.com/MarisaMBurton/c2ee89e50f5de3b8dc4d451fa4fc3b2e

A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Notes:

Beautiful testing suite, nice balance of integration and unit testing
Went a little overboard on assertions; only need one to target claim, split into separate tests if targeting different cases
Consistent implementation of best-choice enumerables
Complete through i4
0 rake sanitation errors
Use of one module (SAAssistant) and Merchant Assistant class to delegate functionality and uphold SRP
Scores:

#### Functional Expectations
3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
#### Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
#### Enumerable & Collections
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
#### Code Sanitation
The output from rake sanitation:all shows...
4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
I think I have developed an odd set of skills with my myriad types of jobs over the last two decades, but I really would like to learn more how to brand myself with confidence.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown
I really liked hearing everyone's different perspectives, as we all come from such different backgrounds and have such different life experiences. I'm contemplating about the balance between America's problems and how lucky I am to have been born here. Our democracy is not perfect, but is functional, and I have many personal freedoms here I would not have in other countries, especially as a woman. Just having the privilege to be in a program like Turing keeps my "first world problems" in check.

#### Introvert
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown
I really enjoyed this gear-up. I realized that I've had more extroverted bosses that don't really understand how to get the best work out of me since I don't go out of my way to look for praise. My extroverted bosses have tended to try to micomanage me in that past, and I tend to do better being left to my own responsibilities. I do feel that Turing sometimes favors extroverts since there is a lot of group work, and sometimes I just need alone time to reinforce and process what I just learned before breaking off into groups and immediately working with other people.
 

#### Resilience
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown
This topic got me thinking a lot about my past life experiences and how I can relate overcoming them to the stress I encounter at Turing. I liked the idea how resilience was internal and based upon how we frame problems. It’s a matter of thinking that you have control over your life and your emotions, instead of feeling out of control in a constant state of rumination, which I think I can sometimes be guilty of. An event does not become traumatic until one ruminates about it and doesn’t let it go; if one looks at an event as a learning experience where one can get knocked down and back up again, then one is more likely to be resilient and push through. Although resilience can be taught, I do believe there are genetic components, as some people are more genetically inclined to be sensitive or inclined toward depressive rumination than others. But that still doesn't mean I can't re-teach myself how to think and from what perspective I should view events or stressful situations. It gives me a bit of hope I can get through Turing, which requires a bit of grit and resilience, and anything else life may throw at me.


### Professional Sessions

#### Personal Branding I
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md
The resume/cover letter workshop was really helpful. I updated my cover letter and rebuilt and redesigned my resume as well as created a LinkedIn page following the advice given. It made me take a more analytical approach to how I represent and brand myself to stand out from other software developers. The session motivated me and got me excited about the possibilities outside of Turing. I completed my LinkedIn profile  and will continue to update it with my relevant skills once I learn more. I'm still wondering how much of my past work experience I should put on my LinkedIn profile vs putting it on my resume, as I prefer to focus on my software-developer-experience on my LinkedIn profile. I will seek advice concerning this. LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisa-burton-14281a130?trk=hp-identity-name 

#### Learning to Pair
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md
I thought going over the DTR was useful. I tend to be shy and not as open when expressing my opinion, and the DTR forces me into a rather uncomfortable place in a good way. It was good to review my strengths and weaknesses in a comfortable environment.

#### Feedback I
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md
I really liked the three forms of feedback, as nothing happens in a vacuum. I think when giving feedback in a professional enviornment, you have to throw away the emotional baggage and always make sure to express your opinion in a kind way, never letting things build up until they reach a point where things are out of control. Thers is always a nice way to give constructive feedback, focusing on the positive and a person's strengths rather than their weaknesses.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Brett Rivers:
"Brett was extremely helpful. He spent much of his free time pairing with me and is a natural teacher, walking me through how I should approach a problem step-by-step, asking questions so that I would reach my own conclusions. He always made sure I was learning throughout the pairing process so that I could emerge a stronger programmer. He's also a great person to talk to concerning expectations and calming my nerves."

#### Feedback to Robbie Smith:
"Throughout Nightwriter, Robbie was a pleasure to work with and was understanding and patient when dealing with my gaps in knowledge. He is a strong programmer, who easily sees patterns and has strong organizational skills. Robbie explained himself well, walking me through every step of his thinking and programming process. He even spent his free time helping me with drills so that I can become a stronger programmer."

#### Feedback to Daniel Rodriguez:
"Daniel was a great partner for Black Thursday. He is a strong programmer and lead the way through stressful and tough coding moments. He has strong organizational and logical skills. He is a hard worker who doesn't stop coding until he thinks it's the best, refactored code he can possibly write at the given moment. He always explained his thought processes really well, and I learned a lot from him by working with him on Black Thursday and would be happy to work with him again."

#### Feedback to Jason Conrad:
"Jason was my fellow SAB rep and was a pleasure to work with, and I look forward to working with him again next module! Jason made it his priority to represent out module at SAB meetings, balancing his own opinion with viewpoints from his fellow classmates. He was also great during Friday retros, cracking a joke and always smiling in order to create a relaxing atmosphere for our cohort to feel more comfortable expressing their opinions on sensitive matters. It was also Jason’s idea to create an exclusive Slack channel for our cohort, giving a place for our classmates to discuss non-coding related topics; this channel has caused us to all become much closer and more communicative, which I think helps with morale a lot."


### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Robbie Smith: 
"Marisa was a pleasure to work with during the Night Writer project. I really appreciated her flexibility and willingness to put in long hours over the weekened to work on the project. Her humility was much appreciated, and she was quick to speak up when she did not understand an issue. This allowed us as a group to work on the areas that she needed and allowed us both to focus on our learning process together."

#### Feedback from Jason Conrad:
"I had the pleasure of working with Marisa on SAB this module. She consistently was trying to take what the people from our Module were saying and figure out ways to improve our experience. She consistently stepped up to the challenge of trying to balance being a student here while being a voice on behalf of our classmates. She assisted in leading weekly retros in which we would try to get a sense of how our classmates were doing so that we could in turn pass it along to the staff so that we could help better the experience for the students. She was was a great person to work with and you could see how much 
she wanted to represent our cohort to the best of her abilities. We were lucky to have her and I am excited to see what the rest of her time on SAB and in this school brings!"

#### Feedback from Daniel Rodriguez
"Marisa was my partner for Black Friday. The two weeks we spent working on this project were both challenging and rewarding. We had a lot of moments where we struggled to move forward due to the size of the project but Marisa’s calming influence and ability to push both of us to keep going kept us on schedule. Whenever we worked side by side we were able to get into a great flow due in large part to her willingness to stop us whenever my instincts to try anything until something worked started to take over. Marisa knows a lot more than she thinks she does. I’ve learned a lot from working beside her and I would be happy to work with her again in the future."

### Playing a Part

I am on the studen advisory board, where I go to weekly meetings and try to represent my cohort as much as possible.

In my first module, I paired a lot with upper-module students, and try to the best of my ability help my fellow cohort students with their programming problems.

I also participate in the Armstrong and Golick possees, and have developed a good relationship with my mentor who I meet with weekly to two times a week.
