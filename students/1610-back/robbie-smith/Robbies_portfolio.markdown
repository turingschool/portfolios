# Robbie Smith - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having to repeat module 1 was kick ass. I'm so glad I did. Having already been through once, I had a good idea where I was lacking in understanding of the material. My focus this time through was to hammer on those areas and help my classmates increase there understanding of some the material as well. I'd say this was a successful module.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This is a collection of individual projects I completed during the module.

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/mastermind.git
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

The goal of this project was to build a ruby implementation of Mastermind.

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/robbie-smith/mastermind

Notes:
* 23 tests one error
* 94 percent coverage
* Project was well divided and organized into classes that made sense.
* Try avoiding methods that just modify instance variables, and think about more how you would get methods to send and receive messages. Watch Sandi Metz' conference talk: Nothing is Something.
* Would like to have seen a little more in depth testing, especially with edge cases
* did extensions, used colors, used Kimble gem

Score:

#### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

#### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

#### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

### HTTP_Yea_You_Know_Me

* http://github.com/robbie-smith/http_you_know_me
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/robbie-smith/http_you_know_me

Notes:
* 31 tests, all pass
* Broke dictionary out to separate class
* memoization! wow.
* Robbie has clearly been reading a lot of POODR and has been incorporating the ideas in there.


Scores:

#### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This is a collection of group projects I completed over the course of the module.

#### NightWriter
Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/robbie-smith/nightwriter

Notes:
* Rake test file
* 26 tests 749 assertions
* 100 percent test coverage
* used in enumerables in test
* Recursive approach was super cool
* Read and write are separated, might belong together in a single class/module/thing
* try to have methods take arguments instead of reading an instance variable

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

#### Black Thursday

Assessed By: Ilana

Repo: https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/black_thursday.git

Notes: 
- 191 tests all passing 
- spec harness passes - it 4
- nice job breaking logic into components 
- not a lot of refactoring needed. 
- made a lot of modules which was great.

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 3: Five or fewer complaints


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown
 * This was an okay gear up. I enjoy the talking about resilience, but unfortunately I couldn't find my gear up group so I hopped into a random group and it wasn't the best. I remember that I thought the second article was pretty lame. It seemed like the dude who wrote it just wanted to be critical of the first article, and based on some of his criticism, I have to actually question whether he read the first article or not.

#### https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown
  * I think that this was one of the more important gear up sessions, not because I personally grew or got anything out of it, but because I had a venue after the session to express some frustrations that I experienced here at Turing. 

#### https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown
  * This was a cool session, but it would have more fun to discuss some of these topics with a more diverse group of people. It seems like politically most of the people here are within the same area of thought, if that is not the case then my group was. It makes it hard to have a good conversation about these things when the view points are very similar.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Deliverables: 
 * Strengths-Finder, I opted not to participate in strengths-finder during module 1 again, and will be continuing with it    again in module 2.
 * DTR for night_writer: https://gist.github.com/Robbie-Smith/b5e3eaf605c04b9273cb04248089e236
 * LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-smith-66108859
 * Resume: My resume was sent to Meg for review.
 
## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
#### To Marisa:
  * Marisa was a pleasure to work with during the Night Writer project. I really appreciated her flexibility and willingness to put in long hours over the weekened to work on the project. Her humility was much appreciated, and she was quick to speak up when she did not understand an issue. This allowed us as a group to work on the areas that she needed and allowed us both to focus on our learning process together.
  
#### To Caroline:
  * I really enjoyed working with Caroline during this project. I don't have any feedback that would be considered "criticism". I think our skills and personalities allowed us to work well with each other. I appreciated Caroline's slower more methodical approach, that really helped to keep us focused on the small steps that needed to be completed first with some of the more complicated methods. Caroline's work ethic and flexibility were much appreciated. It is safe to say that we both learned a lot from the project and each other
  
#### To Eric:
 * It was good having Eric here again. I watched as he went out of his way this module to assist other classmates who were struggling. I also noticed that he maintained a humble attitude throughout this process and was not too proud to also ask for help when needed. These couple of traits that he brings to the mod are very valuable and set a good example for incoming and current students
  
#### To Mike S.:
   * Having Mike around this mod has been sweet. He's brought a lot of positive energy and his positive outlook is very much welcomed. He gets these concepts pretty quick and is always eager to help spread is knowledge.

### Receiving Feedback

#### From Marisa
  * Robbie was a pleasure to work with and was understanding and patient when dealing with my gaps in knowledge. He is a strong programmer, who easily sees patterns and has strong organizational skills. Robbie explained himself well, walking me through every step of his thinking and programming process. He even spent his free time helping me with drills so that I can become a stronger programmer.
  
#### From Caroline  
  * I am so lucky that I got paired with Robbie on the Black Thursday project. Going into the project it was clear that he was more knowledgeable, but he was patient with me and took the time to teach me. I can literally say that my knowledge doubled through the course of the project because of him.
  
#### From Mike S. 
  * Thanks for all the help on the HTTP project this week. Your ability to focus and troubleshoot under pressure is crazy cool, and even cooler because you often post your findings in slack or just speak up when we are all together. I say with confidence that everyone in our cohort has some success rooted in your support.

#### From Eric
 * Robbie is a talented developer. His growth since last module has been exciting to watch. I paired with him a couple times this module and got a glimpse at what it's like to do real peer pair programming. I think he is easily the strongest rubyist in our cohort. Whenever I would see him, he'd have earbuds in, working on something -- always. Robbie is the epitome of work ethic.

### Being a Community Member

 * As for being a community memeber I tried to pick up trash and dishes when I noticed things like that were left out. In addition to that I also gave back by picking things up when needed and putting things back where they belong/cleaning up after myself/others, so that someone else wouldn't have to clean up after me or search for keyboards/cables...etc. Next mod, I'd like to pair and help out the new folks in module 1.
 
### Playing a Part

 * Having to repeat the module, I felt like I had more to offer my classmates than I did in the previous mod. One of my main focuses this module was to help out my classmates as much as possible, especially when it came to issues with the material where I struggled previously.
