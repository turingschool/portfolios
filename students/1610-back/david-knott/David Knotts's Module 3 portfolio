	## D: Professional Skills
	Mix of Professional Development (Job Search, Networking, self awareness) related sessions as well as group discussions around wide ranging social topics.
	
	### Gear Up
	#### Universal Basic Income (UBI)
  
  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
  
	  I loved this Gear Up because it got me thinking on so many diferent levels.  First and foremost it brought awareness
    to the alarming fact that over the next few decades the number of jobs available will drastically decrease.  As someone 
    who is trying to get there first proffesional jobI felt both scared and comforted.  Scared because I have no clue how 
    the world would work without jobs and comforted by the fact the programming will most likely by one of the last jobs to be
    automated (or atleast I hope so).  It felt very empowering being told that the things I'm learning at Turing (programming)
    will shape all parts of society in years to come (though isn't it already?).  I would love to have more GearUps like this one!
	
	#### Tragedy Of The Commons
	
	* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
	
  Reflection:
   I loved the exercise we did at the begining, it promted me realize how important it is for me to be aware of
   who I choose to spend my time with because if I choose to spend the majority of my time with peope I will miss out on
   a lot of wonderful ideas, intriguing conversations, and opportunities.  I also felt some pride because the majority of my
   friends are not like me (all of my closest friends are international).

	## E: Feedback and Community Participation
	
	### Giving Feedback
	
	To Laszlo after after Cloney Island project:
    Laszlo, I enjoyed working with you a second time and I think we both learned a lot (about a lot more than just
  technical skills).  After the retro at the end of our project we talked about when, why, and how our group organization
  went a bit off course.  I was very impressed by both how you handled us being down a member as well as by your willingness
  to provide feedback and support for Eric before he decided it was best to leave.  That took some serous awareness and
  empathy, both valuable skills in all aspects of like.  Going forward I’m excited to see what you do (in mod 4 and in
  the future) and where you go because you my friend can go anywhere.
 <br>
	To Ethan Bennett after Cloney Island project:
    Ethan, box-drop was a hard project for all parties involved.  Thanks for sticking it out!I really appreciated your
  positive way of looking at things, at times I can be pretty negative and your willingness to chug along (especially
  on that last night) inspired me.  One of your skills that I appreciate the most is you ability to offer insightful
  views into situations and paint them in a realistic light that forces me to think (this really came out during our
  google hangouts).  I think one of the most important things that you (and I)  gained out of this project was an
  appreciation for projects managers.  In terms of constructive feedback, I can’t think of anything in particula
  r that you could do better but I definitely think that we could’ve done a better job  as a team realizing (in our case a
  lack of leadership) a problem and confronting it head on sooner.
	
	
	### Being a Community Member
	
	From Laszlo after RailsEngine project:
  This has been my second time to work on a project with David. I think our feedback to each other from our Black Thursday
  project was helpful as from a Git flow point of view our work has been that much smoother and more efficient.
  David is still a very hard worker. He gives 110% and always comes back with initial implementations of the complex issues,
  such as Two-Factor authentication or Google OAuth. He seems to enjoy very much being in the lead to crack the complex tasks.
  With the right team structure, David would be thriving without any doubt.
	
	From Ethan Bennett after Cloney Island project:
	David: I was lucky enough to get placed on a team with David twice, and I enjoyed working with him just as much the second
  time around. David’s great at diving into unfamiliar technology, and that was especially clear in his work on JQuery, Twilio,
  and AWS in this project. We had our latest night at Turing working on this project, and I think David’s initiative to keep
  plowing through it with a good attitude helped the group as a whole. We all suffered from a lack of organization in this
  project, and it was connected to a weak Git workflow. It’s a constructive piece of feedback to consider, but definitely not
  something that David was responsible for any more than the rest of us. I’d collaborate with David again any day!
  
	### Playing a Part
	
I care about every one of my cohort members, whether it's bringing in snacks for them to nibble on or being generally interested
in what they're working on and the struggles that they're facing I'm their for them 100%.
