# Margarett Ly - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn Javascript.

### End of Module Assessment

### Margarett

__Student:__ Margarett Ly

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/margie101/goober

__Production URL:__ https://secret-temple-4587.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* Like the testing -- love seeing good coverage of various UI effects
from data changes
* Data modeling is interesting and effective -- figuring out how to
break the problem into a schema; using 1 table for various user types;
figuring out user <-> ride relationships
* Rails view layer still somewhat verbose; possibly could find
some spots to use partials and/or helper methods to tidy this up

__Evaluation:__

1. Satisfactory Progress 3
2. Ruby Syntax & Style 3
3. Rails Style & API 3
4. Testing 4
5. User Interface 3
6. Javascript (if applicable) N/A

### Attendance

This module I attended all days with the exception of absences on from 9/17 - 9/21.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/margie101/scale_up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1503/15_scale_up.markdown)

This project optimized an existing project for performance and load. It was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

* Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring 1.5
* Load Testing / User Scripting 1
* Database Load 2 - would have been a 3 if in production
* Optimization Techniques 1
* Features - Pagination yes

#### Javascript Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aoili/linkedListInJavascript)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

Building a linked list in javascript. This project was peer-evaluated by Max.

Comments:
Liked that you used Object.prototype to define your methods. Your loops were effective and your functions were easy to understand. I also liked that you build your methods in a way that you could call them in other places and make use of each other to accomplish your objective. I used recursion, so it was nice to see an iterative implementation. Nicely done!

Some of the functions were pretty long, but they were written out in a way that they were easy to understand, so not a huge deal. There may be an opportunity to refactor some of the longer functions into smaller ones to help out with isolation, but again, not a huge deal. Most of the functions are clear and concise.

Scores:
* Functional Expectations 4: Application fulfills all base expectations as well as 1 or more of the remove_by/find_by index/value functions
* Test-Driven Development 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* Javascript Fundamentals 4: Application makes excellent use of JS techniques, including fluid and consistent manipulation of Objects and Functions
* Looping or Recursion 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/Tron)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project. This project was evaluated by Horace.

Game is sweet; awesome interface and playability
testing is thorough and incremental
Game rendering could be more isolated from play / data logic (imagine 2 phases -- move, then render)
some opportunities to use JS objects as maps to clean up some branching and looping complexity

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 4

#### Flack

* [GitHub URL-rails server](https://github.com/morganmiller/flack)
* [GitHub URL-node server](https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/flack-node.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)

In this project we'll be building a chat application that users can interact with through the browser. This project was evaluated by Horace.

Comments:
Great exploration of some interesting SOA and use of React for
some front-end management. Didn't get far into the product / concept
aspects of the project, but it seems like we got some interesting technical
learning along the way.

Glad to see we got a lot of practice with JS both on the server and the client
side. Major bonus points for the React frontend. Sounds like Margarett got
pretty close to a working implementation of a canvas / live-drawing system, but
just didn't quite get it put together at the end.

Scores:
* Services - 4
* Encapsulation 3
* Rails MVC - 3
* TDD - 3
* Concept - 2 - mostly just vanilla chat app at this point
* Deployment - 2 - attempted to deploy on heroku but hit some snags with node side
* Features - 3 - multi channel, auth
* Technical learning / experimentation - 4 -- lots of node and react usage
* Project Management - 3


## Community

### Giving Feedback

I evaluated projects for Drew Reynolds and Max Tedford for Idea Box and Linked List.

### Playing a Part

I paired and contributed to team projects when requested.

## Review

### Notes

* End of module assessment was fun.
* Solid assessment, pleasing. Testing was quite good.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
