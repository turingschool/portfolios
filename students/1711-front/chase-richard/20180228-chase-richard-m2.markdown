## Areas of Emphasis

My learning focus this inning was to be more disciplined in studying.  I wanted to get more comfortable asking classmates for assistance if I've been struggling with a problem for too long.  I also wanted to spend more time in the school during weekends pairing with my project partners.  Technical-wise, I was looking forward to continuing to learn new skills in front-end development so I found learning react very interesting.

I feel I have achieved my goals this inning, but I want to continue to improve on them even more next mod.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

For the individual work projects of Sorting-Suite and Complete-Me, I had a slow start trying to understand the overall processes, but with the help of class discussions, I begin to grasp it and by the evaluations, I felt I had a solid understanding of the concepts.

For the paired projects, I felt I had a good working relationship with each of my project partners.  I feel we each did our fair share, and I enjoyed having someone to brainstorm with on how to solve the requirements of the projects.

I don't feel the first 3 projects contributed as much as the final project to helping me learn front-end web development, but I understand they were important for practicing javascript and general background information.  Game-time was the most challenging due to the math involved.

For the next inning, I will try to better balance learning fundamental concepts with trying to complete my projects.  It seems it is better to suffer a little in both areas instead of trying to do well on my projects and suffering more in other areas

### Study Habits

I learned more about the way I learn, this mod.  I found that I do not learn as the same pace as other people.  It is best for me to work in a group setting to get the basic idea of a concept.  But in these settings I tend to get lost with multiple people talking and white-boarding.  I found once I understand where to begin, I am more productive if I find a quiet space to work through the problems at my own pace, being able to read websites without feeling rushed, but stopping to get assistance when needed.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

Sorting Suite was interesting to me because it demystified how a very common function, sorting, actually works.  It was a nice to change to work as a class, but also seemed a bit disorganized.  I feel it was worthwhile to learn and demonstrate, and to know about Big-O, but perhaps was too in-depth which took time away from learning other important topics.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** N/A

Similar to Sorting Suite, I enjoyed looking under the hood of how auto-complete features work.  I also found it interesting to learn how packages work, setting up the project in such a way that methods of the class can be used in other projects.  I found this project quite helpful in getting a more complete picture of the web-development process.

## B: Group Work & Projects

I think these projects were very helpful.  Canvas is an interesting technology and I imagine it being more popular in the future.  Also it was just a fun project to show off, and feel and sense of accomplishment.  It's something I plan to further develop in my spare time after Turing.

Weatherly made me feel like a front-end web developer for the first time.  It still amazes me that I made something that I can use to search the weather of wherever I choose, using the latest technologies.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Matt Walker
* **Game:** Asteroids
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

The best part of GameTime was seeing the game come together one function at a time.  It was definitely challenging learning to use classes and subclasses at the beginning without a clear understanding of how the code should be structured.  I think this project served my area of emphasis well.  It taught the important concept of classes, the important front-end API of canvas, all in a project that was interesting to me.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Emily Kuckelman
* **Spec Adherence:** N/A
* **User Interface:** N/A
* **HTML Style:** N/A
* **CSS/Sass Style:** N/A
* **JS/React Style:** N/A
* **Testing:** N/A
* **Workflow:** N/A
* **Code Sanitation:** N/A

Weatherly is my favorite project so far.  Even though learning React for the first time is a frustrating experience, especially the asynchronous aspects of it, I began to appreciate the framework it provides.  Also tying in complete-me and seeing the purpose of that project in action in the dropdown location suggestions was pretty neat.  I think it served my area of emphasis very well, as well as my goals beyond Turing.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Feedback III
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

I got the most out of the Feedback sessions. It's very easy for sincere feedback to be taken the wrong way if not presented correctly.  Knowing how to communicate respectively and effectively when sharing your experiences is a skill I value and needed to improve on.  

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Code Debugging the Gender Gap
  * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon
  * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

I enjoyed hearing other student’s different opinions about these important issues.  Although I thought the student’s presentations were lacking in research and objectivity, understandably due to their other commitments, I did gain someone insights into particular points of views.

## Community Participation

I participated in 3 pairing sessions with Mod 1 students this mod.  I also attended a before-class talk with Jeff and a former student which I found enlightening.

## Final Assessment

I plan to complete the second part of the React tutorial at codecademy, as well as finish reading my JavaScript book "The JS Way".  I have also collected a fair amount of repl's of array prototype exercises that I haven't had a chance to work through.  This will be my highest priority, especially the more complex problems.  I don't feel the need to recharge, but instead learn as much as I can during the break to get a head start.
