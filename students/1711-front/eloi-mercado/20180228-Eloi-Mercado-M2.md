## Areas of Emphasis

My learning focus was on really getting down JavaScripts fundamentals. I want to grow my skills on writing readable code. I believe I can continue working to improve my skills.   

## Self-Evaluation

* **D: Community Participation**: _3_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _2.9_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

During this module, we had 4 projects: Game-Time, Sorting Suite, Complete-Me, and Weathrly. Game-Time and Weathrly were paired projects and Sorting Suite and Complete-Me were individual projects.

### Study Habits

I believe my study habits did not change much. I can improve on my study habits and focus more on the final evals.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

I enjoyed learning sorting suite because it allowed me to see what was going on behind the seen of the methods that we use. It helped me brake down big problems into smaller problems that were more manageable.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **Code Sanitation:** _3_

Complete me help me understand the algorithms that go behind auto correct. I really enjoyed learning how tries work and how they are useful. We collaborated well as groups to figure out the solution. I feel confident that it will help me for the more difficult questions at job interviews.

## B: Group Work & Projects

I had a good experience working in groups and on projects. I was able to learn from other individuals and bounce off different Ideas. I plan on continuing to reach out to the group when I truly don’t understand something. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Theresa_
* **Game:** _Snake_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

I enjoyed building a game. It was challenging when we ran into problems that we couldn’t figure out and couldn’t ask our classmates for advice because we were making a completely different game. Over all a believe that our game turned out good, but can still has room for improvement.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Patrick_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

I enjoyed learning react and making an application that pulls real live data to show what the weather is. This project made me feel like we are transitioning into actual programing that can be used in  production. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile Practices & Leadership
      Feedback II
      Feedback III
      Storytelling II
      Outreach & Networking_

I learned how to give and receive feedback, how to tell my story, outreach, and networking. These skills will help me go out into the professional world and allow me to make connections and be  successful in the development community. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
      Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
      Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4_

I found the gear up sessions to be very informative. It is really good to have these conversations and bring up any issues that might occur in the development industry. I do believe that I can bring up these conversations in the workplace and with teammates. 

## Community Participation

I parked with other mod students either to help mod1 students or asking for advice from the upper mods. I also attended get togethers to network and get to know people from other mods. 

## Final Assessment

I plan to keep on practicing the JavaScript fundamentals and try to convert my Mod1 projects to react in order to practice and understand react better. I am looking forward to learn more react. I plan on taking some time over intermission to take care of personal business so that I don’t have any distractions for the next mod.
