# Steven Lee Lawson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My Goal was to apply all that I had learned in mod1 and mod2 to building dynamic applications in React and Redux.

## Rubric Scores

* **D: Professional Skills**: X
* **E: Community Participation**: X

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I do believe I passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects for this mod were SWapiBox and my self-directed project, Wizard Armory.

#### SWapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/SWAmpiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was practice perfecting building React components that populate data on the page by making fetch calls to the Star Wars API. Cards on the page are dynamically populated by different calls for people, vehicles, and planets. They can be 'favorited' as well as 'un-favorited', and by clicking on the favorites button, the user can see all cards that were selected. Neat!

### Students: Steven Lee
### Comments:

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

* 3- - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 2+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

* 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.



#### Wizard Armory
##### Description
Wizard Armory is an app where the user can select the a color of Magic for their cards, then add their selected cards to their own deck! For the truly nerdy only.

Technologies
Wizard Armory is an app built using React, Redux. It is throughly tested using enzyme and jest.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects for this mod included HeadCount2.0 and Movie Tracker.

#### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/HeadCount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

##### Description
A React app that demonstrates data manipulation and reusable components


## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

- 3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## Surprise and Delight
- 2 - Sparkles

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

##### Description
A dynamic application that allows users to create an account and favorite their favorite films if logged in using React and Redux.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## D: Professional Skills
My resume is up on the Turing portfolio site.

### Gear Up
### Microaggressions

 [GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

Microaggressions are an issue that requires constant vigilance and self-checking. Even if one has an inclusive, non-biased perspective, microaggressions can easily sneak into one's speech patterns if not cognizant.

### Group Think

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

There was much debate in my small group for this session; some felt group think had led to some positive results in history, but I believe the point of the session was to make us aware how group think can lead to biases.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

After two innings as an SAB rep, I used my extra time this inning to try to help others and connect with other developers not in my cohort.
