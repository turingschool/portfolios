# Ngoc Phan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this mod to get more comfortable with react and testing as well as learn redux to the best of my abilities. Working on my personal project helped deepen my understanding of react/redux and testing. I also wanted to attend more coding meetups and start the outreach process. I was able to attend the Turing react meetup and the lady coders conference. Unfortunately, I was not able to do as much job outreach as I prefer due to mod 3 being more time intensive than anticipated.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Our Individual projects for this mod were SwapiBox and our personal project. SwapiBox pulled information from the Star Wars Api. We made multiple/nested fetch calls according to which button were clicked. The data had to be cleaned and the information displayed. This was my first confrontation with nested fetch calls. I needed to work on my testing after this project. I picked my personal project on a topic that interested me which is food as well as solidify the areas I wasn't feeling comfortable with. Feed Me fetches data from the Yummly Api and displays that data. The user is able to favorite recipes and save them for a later date. I felt more comfortable with everything after this project.  

### Study Habits

My study habits during this mod were similar to the previous mods. I stayed till seven week nights and came in on the weekends. I find that this was the best schedule for me to accomplish what I needed to. I believe I need to devote a little bit more time in looking through pass projects, refractoring them as well as create more little projects on the side to get more muscle memory and get faster at the things I know so I can spend more time on the things I don't.

Swapi-Box is a react app that allows the users to view StarWars Data. It uses the Star Wars API. This was an individual project designed to challenge ourselves in building react, making API calls, cleaning data and TDD.

 This application fetches recipes from the Yummly API and displays the recipes. The user can favorite the recipes after they either create an account or login if they already have an account. The user can also filter through selected categories of recipes. This application was built in two weeks and uses the following frameworks and tools: React, Redux, Router, Jest, Enzyme and Firebase.

## B: Group Work & Projects

### HeadCount 2.0

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a react app that allows users to view and compare various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. Users can scroll through visual cards representing the districts then click on up to two cards if they would like to compare data. Currently, HeadCount 2.0 only displays a single page that shows the percentage of kindergartners in a full day program. There are future plans to implement more pages utilizing more data such as enrollment, test scores, dropout rates, graduation rates, remediation, household incomes, and special education.

### Movie Tracker

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

An application used to present new movie releases, and allows a user to add a movie to their favorites. App is built on the front end using React, React-Router, Redux, and CSS. The app uses a postgresql backend. Testing suite was build using Jest/Enzyme. Project was build over the course of 9 days with a 3-person team.

## C: Professional Skills

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Microagression
  * Gear Up 2: Group Think
  * Gear Up 3: Common Grounds

Microagression was a great gear up. It addresses things we don't put much thought into in our everyday lives. I was grateful Turing brought this topic up because I wouldn't have thought about it otherwise. Group think was a good talk. I thought me to acknowledge that it is a thing and to recognize it. It will be something I work on in the future to speak up when I recognise it. 

## Community Participation

This mod I went to TAAP and JCS meetups. I also attending demo night and a react meetup at Turing as well as a lady coder's weekend conference. 

## Final Assessment

I plan on finishing the WesBos 30 day challenges over break because they provided great information and I enjoyed them over last break. I also plan to build a couple more react/ redux apps for fun.
