## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

My focus for this inning was to build on my foundation of knowlege from mod1. I was able to do so by expanding my javascript from ES5 to ES6, HTML to JSX, and CSS to SCSS. I was also able to introduce some new tools such as HTML Canvas, binary and prefix tries, node packaging, and more.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

In mod1 I was always feeling behind, so in mod2 I started to read the lesson the day before it was presented. This worked out well when I was able to do so, but I was not 100% with that practice. For next mod I will have to do an even better job of pre-teaching myself.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I really enjoyed the group effort that happened for sorting sweet. For the first time we had every member of class giving a collective effort towards a common goal. Given such a short deadline, it was great to see everyone come together and make something overwhelming seem possible. This project served my overall goals by showing me a very abstract concept and breaking it down into small managable pieces. It also showed how there can be multiple approaches to the same problem with some being more performant than others.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete-me, just like Sorting Suite, was a class effort towards a very abstract problem. This particular project strengthened many relationships I had with my classmates. Being able to articulate the code very well, I was quickly helping other classmates understand and whiteboard the code. This project served my overall goals by preparing me for technical interview questions.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Jon Sweet
* **Game:** Missile Command
* **Functional Expectations:** 4.1
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 4
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

What I enjoyed most about GameTime was the use of new es6 knowlege to make javascript much easier. Using HTML Canvas to render code to the screen was also a great way to create animation for the first time. The most challenging part of GameTime was being aware of the multitude of conditions that may or may not occur and having to solve for each of them. This project served my overall goals by showing me a new use for javascript by animating objects on the DOM.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Edgar Munoz

* **PASS**

* **Spec Adherence:** PENDING
* **User Interface:** PENDING
* **HTML Style:** PENDING
* **CSS/Sass Style:** PENDING
* **JS/React Style:** PENDING
* **Testing:** PENDING
* **Workflow:** PENDING
* **Code Sanitation:** PENDING

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I was very excited about the Weatherly project. I have been looking forward to React ever since I first learned about it. The JSX language combined with component usage really shed some light on modern day web developement. The most challenging part of weatherly was the Jest/Enzime testing. Testing the shallow copy of a componet was simple, but testing for functionality through a mounted component with mock data is still confusing. This project served my goals the most out of all mod2 projects because ReactJS is one of the top languages used in modern software developement.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Feedback III
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

  These profossional develepement sessions helped hone my skills that I have aquired from my previous careers to be more applicable to the programming world.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
  * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
  * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

  The gear up session that stuck with me the most was the case study with mod4. That session gave me insight to what sort of options lay ahead in a career as a developer. Having the options presented in an unbiased manner with clear pros and cons was amazing. Even better was the two guest speakers we had that came in and shared their experiences and observations on the topic.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

This inning I was much more involved with the community than I was last inning. This time around I was able to be a teacher and not just student by pairing with mod1 students both officially and unofficially. Being stopped in the hallway to assist students really made me feel like I truly learned and retained the knowledge I aquired in mod1. I have not yet reached out to the Denver software community, but plan to during mod3.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

This inning I must reinforce my array prototype knowledge and become more familiar with my React tools. I plan on completing a lot more object manipulation problems until it becomes second nature. With React I will seek out more tutorials and videos online. To recharge my batteries during intermission week I will spend some time in the sunlight, but dedicate a little time each night to the prework for mod3.
