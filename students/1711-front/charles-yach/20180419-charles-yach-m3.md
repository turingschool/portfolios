### Evaluation Scores

Awaiting scores

## Hockey Line-Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/Hockey-Line-Up)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

### Evaluation Scores

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.


## C: Group Work & Projects

## Head Count 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/Headcount-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a react app that allows users to view and compare various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. Users can scroll through visual cards representing the districts then click on up to two cards if they would like to compare data. Currently, HeadCount 2.0 only displays a single page that shows the percentage of kindergartners in a full day program. There are future plans to implement more pages utilizing more data such as enrollment, test scores, dropout rates, graduation rates, remediation, household incomes, and special education.

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow
- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### Surprise and Delight

- 3 - Hot Fire

## Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/movie-tracker)

### Specification Adherence

- 3+ - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4- - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master.

# D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up

### Microaggressions

#### [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

In this GearUp we discussed microaggressions and how to build our skill at being able to interrupt microaggressions. Through self reflection, group discussions, and roleplaying, we became more aware of microaggressions and how they affect every day lives.

### Group Think

#### [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

This GearUp dives into the understanding of groupthink and determining specific ways to challenge groupthink when we experience it. After reading through articles and having group discussions, as a class we shared what we can implement immediately in your next project, cohort retro, or posse?

### Mod 4 Lead - Public Data & Changing the World

#### [GitHub URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023)

In this GearUp we discussed how there is a lot of public information available either through apis or webscrapping. This information can be used in software to share information with the world in a more interactive or appealing way. Often there is data out there that is not being used by any site that could be very helpful to other people.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module I continued the relationships I had with other modules that were built up through previous pairings. I continued that trend by befriending mod 1 folks so that I could continue to help people in mods 1, 2, and 3. There were also a lot more informal hallway conversations where I would help people just walking to and from rooms. Outside of the basement I attended the Demo Night at Go Spot Check and the Denver React Meetup. These were great opportunities to network with developers from the real world and see what sort of happenings are happening in other places.
