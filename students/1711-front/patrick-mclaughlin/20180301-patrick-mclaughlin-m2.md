# Patrick McLaughlin - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module two, I want to focus heavily on progessing my abilities around javascript, as well as become more active in the Turing community. I plan on attending Iron FE sessions regularly, as well as pairing with the new Mod 1 students. Additionally, I plan on finding a mentor this module so that I can get a better feel for what working as a front end developer looks like.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this module were quite a bit different than the individual projects in mod 1. Adding the element of whole-group collaboration was an interesting process. At times it seemed like a struggle to get every one on the same page and keep the project progessing. On the other side of that coin, I'm not sure if the project would have been completed within the time constraints if it truly were a solo project. 

#### Study Habits

My study habits were a little different this module than in mod 1. The projects this inning were significantly more time intensive, so most of my time out of class was spent working on them. I was able to make up for that by attending iron fe regularly to help sharpen my skills working with array prototypes, as well as a little bit of recursive functions. Additionally, pairing with the mod 1 students helped me solidify my foundations of html, css, and javascript.

#### Sorting Suite

[Sorting Suite Repo](https://github.com/patrickmc21/sorting-suite)

[Project Specification](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting suite was a project based on creating a variety of array sorting algorithims. The end goal was to be able to demonstrate how bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort work on a high level by using numbered cards, as well as to code out the sorting algorithims.

This project was a little frustrating at first for me, as I struggled to generate the code for each algorithm on my own. Luckily, the group think was able to come up with viable code, and once we had that accomplished, the concept of sorting algorithims became much clearer to me. This helped me to understand a little more of what is going on under the hood in javacript when you call a .sort() array prototype method.

#### Complete Me

[Complete Me Repo](https://github.com/patrickmc21/complete-me)

[Project Specification](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete was a project where we were to create a prefix data trie that can be used as an auto-complete node in future projects. The trie should have the ability to insert new words, suggest words based on a prefix, add priority to more commonly selected suggestions, and delete unwanted suggestions.

I enjoyed Complete me. I had a pretty clear idea of how I wanted to approach the task after running through the linked-list and binary-tree code alongs from class. I did not realize how much code had to go in to a feature as seemingly simple as an

Evaluator comments:
Nice implementation of a front-end

##### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.


### Projects

The group projects for this module were a lot of fun for me. I was fortunate to have great partners for each of the projects. I also enjoyed working on projects that were considerably larger than their mod 1 counter parts. It was also nice to make use of a testing suite to help refactor code and have an easy way to ensure the new code is working.

#### Gametime

[Github Repo](https://github.com/patrickmc21/game-time)

[Project Specification](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Gametime was a project where we were to make a game using Canvas JS and make use of es6 classes to control the game pieces. 

Game time was the highlight of mod 2 for me. We were able to get basic functionality of the game down fairly quickly, so we were able to devote a lot of time to improve features and the UI/UX of the game. We were able to implement local storage so that high scores can be tracked. Additionally, my partner and I felt strong enough that we were able to break up the latter stages of the projects into small stories, and work remotely to complete them. I feel like this greatly improved my understanding of the github workflow, and how tools like waffle can really help the progession of a project. 

Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time

Instructor: Brittany

Functional Expectations
4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

Minus the memory leak (which is not a detached DOM node like I expected, but still couldn't track it down), the application is perfectly playable.

User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Teensy bit of jankiness with animations/shapes but clearly a lot of effort went into creating the UI!

Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate. ESLint shows 0 complaints.

JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Weathrly

[Github repo](https://github.com/patrickmc21/weathrly)

[Project Specification](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly gave us our first taste of the ReactJS framework, as well as our first API fetch. The goal of this project was to create a weather forecast app that would take the user input of either a city or zip code, and present them with current weather conditions, a seven hour forecast, and a ten day forecast for that location. 

I thoroughy enjoyed working with React. It made working with the DOM much more manageable, and creates an app that is very easy to manipulate based on conditions and user input. I particularly liked how you can dyncamically create components based on the props being sent down the app. I look forward to taking a deeper dive into react next inning.

## D: Professional Skills

This inning, gear ups were focused on talking about diversity, in both the community and the work environment. Additionally, I attended the mod 4 led session on ethics in AI. Professional development was focused on promoting yourself through storytelling, and using that in your cold and warm outreach. We also covered agile workflow and giving verbal feedback.

###Professional Development

#### Agile Practices and Leadership
This was a very valuable PD session, as it shed a little more light on what the agile process looks like, and how we follow that process here at turing. It helped me to be more focused on setting up projects here at turing to be set in stages, and have them be constantly evolving and improving.

#### Feedback II

This session focused on building off of feedback I, and introduced giving verbal feedback to your project partner(s). This is a useful skill because often times feedback needs the context of voice inflection and body language, which is hard to simulate via written feedback. Learning how to do it in a manner that is constructive and kind is very valuable.

#### Storytelling II

This session was focused on developing your professional story so that you can comfortably pitch why you would be a good developer for a company to hire. This was valuable for me, because I do not really like talking about myself. However, it is important in a job interview to sell yourself, because you want to be the most desirable candidate that you can be.

#### Outreach and Networking

The session focused on various techniques for building your network, whether it be through mentors, meetups, warm outreach from your network, and cold outreach. I found this very useful, as I feel like networking is a opportunity for me to improve in. 

### Gear Up

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

This session shed some light on the subject of gender inequality in the tech community. It was frustrating to hear that women who enjoyed working with tech and wanted to pursue a career in that field were pushed away from that path because of their gender. Going forward I will be more mindful of that situation, and encourage those of every background that they should pursue their dreams regardless of what others tell them. 

#### Parable of the Polygon

This session was focused on how people want to be surrounded by people similar to them, and how this can cause a negative impact in the community. It then touched on how diversity quotas can be beneficial for promoting a diverse community. I agree with this principal, as having different perspectives can help towards creating products that work for everyone, which is something that might be overlooked if the developers working on a project are all from similar backgrounds.

#### Ethics in AI

This session brought up the possible dilemmas that could arise with increased use of AI in products. It suggests that many low skill jobs may be dissolved due to AI being used in its place, which could lead to an increase in unemployment. So, the question was brought up about to to treat those displaced workers. Should the government pay for them to be trained so that they can perform a more skilled job? Should their be a tax on AI so make up for lost tax revenue from these jobs being removed? It was a very thought provoking discussion, and at this moment I am still at a loss of what approach to take to handle the situation. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This inning definitely saw an increase in my participation level with the Turing community. I attended Iron FE regularly.  I enjoyed working with the upper mods on problems built around array prototypes and recursion. Additionally, I paired with the Mod 1 students regulary to lend a hand with topics they were being challenged with. I also was a regular participant in the Mod 2 led mythical creatures sessions for the Mod 1 class. Jared and I also submitted our GameTime project to the code fair. I enjoyed showing the community our finished project and code base.
