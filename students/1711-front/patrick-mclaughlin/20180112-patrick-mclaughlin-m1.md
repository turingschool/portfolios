# Patrick McLaughlin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing to see if coding is something I would like to do as a career. I came into Mod 1 pretty nervous about whether I would be able to keep up or not, as well as if I could grasp the content. I made a commitment to myself that if I wasn't able to cut it at Turing, it wouldn't be for a lack of effort. So, my plan was to come in every day and put in as much work as my cognitive resources could handle, and that hopefully as a result of that I would come out of Mod 1 with a much better grasp on javascipt, css, and html.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

  The individual projects were a fun way to find out some approaches to tackling certain problems on your own, and come up with your own tricks to doing them. Number Guesser was also a pretty good exercise when it comes to learning to cap the struggle without burning too much time. An error I made on the first day of attempting to tackle javascript. Overall I was happy with the project, I thought adding the gifs to the page was kind of a fun flare. I enjoyed putting my own touch to the static comps as well, keeping all of them to a outdoor activity related theme.

#### Number Guesser

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/number-guesser]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]

Number guesser is a page I built in which the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1-100. Upon guessing the correct number, the user can progress to up to 4 more levels with number ranges incrementing by 100 each time. The last level is a playground type environment where the user can create their own range of numbers to guess within.

Student: Patrick McLaughlin

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Notes/What To Work On:
DESIGN
Update design for user guess - hard to read some text
Appreciate the surprise background changes!!!

HTML
Hooray for tabindex, semantic HTML, labels, AND running through a screenreader!

CSS
Use Idiomatic CSS for organization

JS
Work on naming for variables and functions
Opportunities for refactoring w/longer functions. Try to keep functions around 8 lines or less, give or take

Functional Expectations
Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

#### Static Comp 1

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/pm-comp-challenge-1]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html]

I went into static comp 1 with the goal of designing a site for hikers who want to climb a 14er. With that in mind, I wanted to create layouts for all screen sizes that did not require the user to have to scroll to find the content they are searching for. I was pretty proud of the way my layouts switched between desktop, to tablet, to mobile.

Feedback I received on my static comp was that my choice of fonts did not create very readible text. It worked for each icon title, but for the subtitle in the top left box, words blurred together.

#### Static Comp 2

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/pm-comp-challenge-2]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html]

I saw static comp 2 as layout that would be good for featuring athlete bio cards in a site dedicated to an extreme sports event. I based mine off the the RedBull rampage event, and by doing that I already locked myself into a color scheme that works. I was proud of getting the cards to flip on hover, and change the background image of the card header on hover.

Some feedback I received for this project was my choice of fonts. I used one font for the entire page, and it did have readibility. Where it created conflict was in comparison to the font in the redbull rampage logo. That will be something to keep in mind for future projects.

#### Static Comp 3

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/pm-comp-challenge-3]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html]

Static comp 3 was quite the challenge for me. I opted to build my site without using grid or flexbox. The result was a site that required several media queries to be responsive. I big block for me was trying to figure out what theme I wanted to build my layout around. I opted with a site dedicated to hiking trail conditions. I was proud of building my bar graph from scratch, although it was a pretty code intensive endeavor. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My paired projects were with Emily for Linked-lists, Eloi for IdeaBox, and Matt for 2DoBox

#### Linked-Lists

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/linked-list]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]

  This site give the user the ability to create bookmark cards for websites they would like to save. I enjoyed diving into RegEx to prevent users from inputing an invalid url. It was also my first pair project, so it was extremely useful to do that using the git and github workflow as well as using Waffle to assign tasks. 

  Student: Emily and Patrick

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Notes/What To Work On:
OVERVIEW
All the way through Phase 4!!! You both did great with speaking to your code.

DESIGN
Stays true to the spirit of the comp
Like the color choices for the counter
Add spacing between borders and cards. Make sure that the 'Linked List' header is flush with inputs/buttons
Some work to make it fully responsive - weirdness happening before different media queries
Ditch the alert for error messaging and find a more elegant solution. Tell the user to know that part of having a valid URL includes having http:// tacked on the front
Bookmark box falling outside of parent container

HTML
Good spacing. Keep using semantic tags.
Lines 3-39 should be indented two more spaces. Lines 7 & 8 should be one line. Use HTML Style Guide for reference
Add aria-labels to inputs and send through screen reader
Inputs should have a form around them for accessibility w/keyboard. This allows you to submit with a keypress (as it's currently set up, it only submits on click)

CSS
Nice job with organizing declarations alphabetically in each selector
No need for a 0 margin on body since you are using a reset
Overuse of absolute positioning. Typically, you want to use absolute ONLY when you can't get any other positioning to make the layout work
Add box-sizing: border-box to override default box-sizing to make sure boxes are the exact width you set.
  
JS
Nice job using named functions in event listeners
Unclear why event listener is set up on body instead of the link counter div in Line 6
Like the focus back to the input on 15 and 22
Check for using soft wrap on long lines of code
Nice job knowing what this is in your code!! As well as being able to speak to your regex code!
Opportunity for some refactoring in event listener for creating card - but good overall!

GIT/GITHUB
HOORAY for Waffle!!! Happy to see that it helped with driving the project
Nice work using branches to work on features. Be sure that you are following conventions for commiting - capitalize first letter and be concise and specific with commit messages

Functional Expectations
Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

Pairing/Collaboration
Proficient

(feedback) “Patrick, working with you on this first paired practice was both enjoyable and beneficial. You were very approachable, kind, and  helpful throughout the entire process. When we ran into merge conflicts, we were able to work together to solve them, and our workflow was very easy to keep up with. The only thing that I can think of for you to work on is something that you were already working on by the end of the project -- not running into a wall over and over again when you come across something that you cannot figure out. Don’t hesitate to ask for help, and spend hours trying to figure out a problem. Also, if your partner doesn’t know how to solve the problem either, then it will be beneficial for them to figure it out and most likely going to be easier to figure out together.”

#### IdeaBox

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/idea-box]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]

IdeaBox is a site dedicated towards a user thinking of an idea, and putting it along with a relevant description onto a card. The idea would persist on page load using local storage. Additionally, the user can change the quality of the idea between 3 different levels, and search ideas based on the title and description.

Student: Patrick and Eloi

Evaluator: David

Notes/What To Work On:
would like to see a ton more commits! 13 is not enough

COMP
Use fixed widths for vertical(top and bottom) box model things - should not be resonsive from top to bottom, only left to right

HTML
Use labels!! Either aria-label or label element

CSS
consider organizational comments and using bem

JS
pull duplicate blocks into functions and pass whatever is dynamic as an argument
love that you used a constructor function and especially a method on the prototype!!!
use more abstractional naming, ie. Idea instead of IdeaCardObject
as you prepend to the page use your object to your advantage, ie. newIdea.title instead of $inputTitle.val()
be verbose when naming variables, wtf are x and y???!?!

GIT/GITHUB
Many more commits!!!
get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!

Functional Expectations
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS
Structure of Code
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB
Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github
Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing

DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING
Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.


(feedback) “I think that we collaborated really well on this project. Your biggest strength is the ability to think logically and keep moving forward through the project. All of our road blocks that we ran into were miner and we were able to move through them quickly. I really enjoyed the fact that we put in the time on the weekend to get the project done early and not have to stress to finish last minute. One of the things that we did struggle on was GitHub. Especially when you would try to pull from GitHub and it was not really working right. It seemed like some of the code would not link up properly. I believe if we reached out more for help on the issues that we encountered we will be able to solve these problems in the future. In all, it was great to have you as a partner.”

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [https://github.com/patrickmc21/todobox-pivot]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html]

2DoBox was an exercise of refactoring a previous code-base, and then pivoting the design of the site from a list of ideas to a to-do list. Many of the same functionality from ideabox was retained, although a few items such as importance was bumped up from 3 to 5 levels, as well as adding a checkbox fieldset to sort cards by importance. We also were able to implement momentJS into our project so that to-dos could have a due date, and that opening the page with past due cards would cause them to be loaded on top of the page with a class to emphasize they are past due.

Students: Matt & Patrick

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Notes/What To Work On:
DESIGN/COMP
PUMPED that you decided to tackle working with time and using the MomentJS library
Like the changes you made so that Show More ToDos button only appears when there are more than 10 todos
Not sure about that gradient - but other colors work together
Redesign the Completed Task button so that it looks like a button. No indication that is a button or clickable
Like that you worked in the ability to filter for more than one importance type

HTML
Nice job with labels and other ARIA attributes - especially the use of landmark roles
Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - main form does pretty ok... checkboxes for filtering do well... but the dynamically generated cards are not fully accessible.

CSS
Set font-size on your html selector. Also note that setting the font-size in px (line 9) runs into accessibility issues - as it will override any browser settings set by the user. Setting this to a percentage avoids this. 62.5% would be the equivalent of 10px. See this article for a more detailed explanation

JS
Good refactoring of event listeners to named functions
Continue to work on naming. Good work with being more verbose but some naming still makes the code hard to follow - like cardAppendAdjust, cardAdjust, and timeIfElse. It is not clear what these functions do based on names
Unclear why classes are being passed around in JS that are controlling CSS. Use add/remove/toggle for CSS classes when necessary
In line 116 (and elsewhere) use boolean instead of 0 vs 1 for completed vs non-completed
Importance array can be saved/accessed directly in constructor function instead of created and returned from function
Opportunities for refactoring with append/prepend as well as other functionality around voting, importance, title/task
Great work getting things refactored from inherited repo, overall

GIT/GITHUB
Be sure to name branches/PRs descriptively - for features
Stay consistent in being verbose/concise with commits

(feedback) "Pat, it was great working with you. I respect your work ethic and that you wanted code everyday and get the project done. You were stronger at passing arguments between functions at the beginning of the project and I appreciate you letting me drive while we were building those out and coaching me through a couple spots. Your explanations helped me a ton. I think our project turned out great. We have similar personalities, think about code similarly, work well together and I look forward to working with you again. You may get partners in the future who don’t like to throw things at the wall as much as we did and you may have to slow down a little, but keep helping and explaining things to your future partners. Regardless of their learning style, they will appreciate this.”

## D: Professional Skills

This mod, we learned about ways to manage stress, working with people who have varying personality types, and getting out of a fixed mindset.

### Gear Up

#### Dealing with Difference:Introverts and Extroverts
  I had always thought of myself as an introvert with some extroverted tendencies. This exercise introduced me to the concept of an ambivert, so I feel pretty confident that I fit into that category. This was a useful exercise as it was a good kickoff to paired projects and working with different types of folks, and how you can reach compromises with your partner(s) to reach your project goals.

#### Stress Session 1 
  This session introduced us to stress, what types their are, and how it can affect you and your body. The instructor introduced us to some exercises to help us realize where our stress levels are, what can cause our stress levels to rise, and how to relax once you have becomed stressed.

#### Stress Session 2
  The second portion of the stress session was focused on how we can take a proactive approach to managing stress. The instructor introduced various body scan techniques and things to focus on so that you will not be as stressed. I thought the body scan was particularly useful, it is a good way to relax and help yourself fall asleep.

#### Net Neutrality
  This was a great gear up session. It really helped me clear up some things about net neutrality I was still unclear about. Additionally, it was good to hear everyones' opinions on how net neutrality can effect us as developers, and how it can effect small and large websites. This is definitely a topic I will continue to explore on my own time.

### Playing a Part

## E: Community Participation
 I attended every mythical creatures session Mod 2 put on, which was extremely helpful and a practice I'd like to carry into the next mod. Additionally, I paired with many members of my fellow mod working on mythical creatures and DOM manipulation practice. I attended Code Fair and the SAB winter social, which was a nice opportunity to see others' projects and socialized with other mods. I also have gone to Brothers a few times on Thursdays to socialize with the rest of the Turing community.
