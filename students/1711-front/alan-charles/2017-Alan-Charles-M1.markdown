# (Alan Charles) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn how to code (obviously). The difference between this and my normal approach to education was that I actually wanted to learn, not just pass. I feel like I've learned more in the last 6 weeks than I have during my entire career as a student. I didn't know that I would have to work on myself so much, so I can't say I set out to improve in that respect, but it is perhaps the thing I am most grateful for. I learned how to deal with stress in ways I previously would never have imagined. I'm not great at dealing with frustration, and learning to learn by failure is a great life lesson.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed the End of Module Assessment. I did relatively well with the dom manipulation eval, the math of calculating a tip was lost on me for longer than I would like to admit, but I got through it. The mythical creatures eval went well, as well. I overthought certain parts, partly because I was nervous. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)These are my projects for Mod 1. The individual projects were really interesting. I definitely learned a lot and always left the project with an understanding of how I could do it better if I had the chance to do it over. They helped me learn the importance of organized, clean code and the importance of a solid workflow. I learned as much, if not more, with these projects as I did with the group projects. I liked that I could take things I learned from the last project and apply it to the next, especially with the static comps. I feel like my CSS has greatly improved. 

#### (Project Name)- Number Guesser

#### (Project Name) Static-Comp-1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/-AJC-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

(description) This static comp taught me a lot. I used flexbox for the first time which made it so much easier to align all of the squares. I learned a lot about styles and design and was really thrilled that I got to work in my love of the Big Lebowski. The gif was an interesting way to bring my page to life. I got sick during this project and was unable to work on responsive, which is frustrating because I feel it would have really helped me down the road. 


#### (Project Name) Static-Comp-2 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/ajc-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

(description) This was one of my favorite projects this mod. I learned more about CSS during this project than I have at any other point in my short career. I learned a lot about responsive, especially when trying to set margins that don't set you up for failure down the line. I learned how to animate elements in CSS and made all of my cards flip on hover, which was pretty cool. It was also the first time I learned how to build a dropdown menu. My responsive is still something I'm trying to get better at, but this project really laid down the foundations. 

#### (Project Name) Static-Comp-3 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/ajc-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

(description) This project was a lot of work in a short amount of time. I definetly learned a lot about time management for this one. I also feel like this was the first time my css didn't feel hacky, at least on full screen. Everything aligned perfectly and I knew exactly how to manipulate elements. The biggest problem I had was with the display between full screen and mobile. Mobile looks decent, but there are a few elements that move a little in between break points. This has a lot to do with falling back on bad habits and setting margins instead of aligning items properly. I was much better than the last static in terms of not doing it, it was just the graph image and the job-description box. I learned a lot about how much easier it would be to do responsive had I set them up differently in the beginning. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro) The group projects were really imformative. I found I often learned different ways of approaching problems that I had otherwise not thought of. They gave me the time to really focus on the javascript side of things, which was more helpful than anything else. I worked with Aldo Mercado for Linked-List, Chase Richard for Idea-box, and Eloi Mercado for 2do-Box-Pivot. 

#### (Project Name) Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amercado1014/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

(description) This was my favorite paired-project. I learned the most about Javascript, probably because it was still so new, but more so because Aldo and I were really great partners. We worked on every step of the project together and made sure the other understood what was happening. The project itself is basically a bookmark site. The user can enter a link and title into input fields and keep track of them. The user can sort cards that have been created. The focus of this project seemed to be on event bubbling. 

(evaluation comments)
  some broken UI elements
  fix buggy UI issues, otherwise generally looks good.
  really well crafted codebase
  nicely done -- but make sure the UI is as nice as the code.

(feedback to me)
“Had a great time working with you. You communicated very well through the entire project. I liked how we were able to break things down to the simplest form and work up from there. Even though we had a minor setback from doing our CSS zoomed in, we were still able to finish within our set timeline. Using github and having more commits is something we agreed we could improve on. Overall I was really happy with the outcome and would love to work with you again in the future.”


#### (Project Name) Idea-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

(description) I learned a lot during this project, with a special thanks to Chase. I was sick during this project and missed one of the most important lessons. Chase helped me understand local storage and array prototypes. The project gives the user the ability to enter a title and idea and store the idea as a card. Quite similar to linked-list with the exception that everything is stored in local storage. 

(evaluation comments)
some buggy UI behavior on large screens
inputs don't clear after submitting the idea
search works for titles, not body of idea
using forEach!
used array of qualities!
only 2 global variables!

“Alan was a great partner to work with.  He took the lead on the HTML and CSS and when he finished that he helped me with the Javascript.  Alan was very good about noticing when we were struggling too long and sought out help.  Something we could improve on is reviewing the look of the project in detail to ensure it’s as close to the comp as possible.  Overall I think we worked well together and I was happy with our result.”

#### (Project Name) 2Do-box-Pivot

(description) This project pushed me to my limits. Things didn't go well with my partner (our schedules were messed up during the holiday season and then he got sick) so I was forced to do the whole thing. It was frustrating but I learned more about javascript than I have at any other point this mod. The project was focused on refactoring someone elses codebase and adding new functionalilty, mainly in terms of sorting the idea cards. 

(evaluation comments) Evaluator- Pam 

  DESIGN/COMP
   Completed through Phase 3. Very little refactoring of CSS - mostly JS.
   Code that was added to the project is not responsive. Weird things happening at different break points
   Partial filtering - must refresh screen to work properly
   Only need filtering for importance. For the future, be sure to clarify specs with instructors when unsure
   No visual indication of when the submit button is disabled/enabled
  
  HTML
   Nice job with labels and other ARIA attributes
   Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - main form does pretty well, but the dynamically generated        cards are not fully accessible.

  CSS
   Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing         declarations

  JS
   Naming pretty easy to follow
   Be mindful of syntax. Follow style guides for JS
   Be ready to speak to all of your code - not just what you write, but also what you inherit
   Opportunities for refactoring for event handlers on filtering buttons by using delegation
   Unclear why you are pulling from local storage a second time in 50 - just append cards with complete-task as value to the  page
   Remove leftover functionality in line 69
   Only pass in dynamic arguments in line 73 for constructor - title, content, id. this.complete property could be set up as    boolean of true/false
   Pass entire object as argument to createCard in line 108
   downvote/upvote quality could be refactored into one single function. Same with editTitle/editContent
  
  GIT/GITHUB
    Having one final push to master from one single commit is unnacceptable - be sure to make atomic commits, work on branches, etc

 I believe that we were able to push trough the project quickly with the limited of time that we had. Your biggest strength was pushing along when I got sick and being understanding that I was not feeling 100%. One thing that we can improve on is to try and set our selfs up to work remote. This will allow us to work on the project even though our schedules are not the same.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name) Health 1 

* [GitHub URL](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T029P2S9M-F8QVC3T0C/download/well-being_stress_management_101.pptx)

This gear up was super helpful. I had no real idea how to deal with stress, or how to notice I was even stressed out. I liked learning about the different ways to deal with stress, like taking time away from something. I also found it really helpful to learn about how important getting enough sleep is. 

#### (Session Name) Health 2 

* [GitHub URL](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T029P2S9M-F8R3RGX9B/download/well-being_self_care_101.pptx)

I think this gear-up was well-timed. We had already gone over the importance of managing stress, but then were loaded with twice the amount of stress (the Turing Way). So, it was good to go back and really focus on how we're noticing stress, and how we're dealing with it. It helped me take a second to breath, and get my feet under me. 

#### (Session Name) Draw the Owl 

* [GitHub URL}(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5Uwcdl7e10vzJFCK8JlBLfPet-o8E44q4BFmNtrazI/edit#gid=1084206419) 

This was a community gear-up provided by mod 4. I didnt get the markdown, but the entire session was about how to deal with failure. It was a lot of things we've already gone over, but it really cemented the idea that failure is really the only way to learn. It helped remove frustration that traditionally came with failure. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was happy to be apart of the Turing Community. I'm usually relatively introverted and don't go for the community involvment. However, everyone at Turing makes it so easy to be apart of the community. I met with students in mod 2 quite often, which was incredibly helpful. I participated in the posse meetings, and did my best to help other students in my mod that had questions or we're struggling to manage stress.
