## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? 
What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? 
Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

Since I figured I'd be doing a lot of solo work during my repeat, I figured I would need to finally work on being able to work from home. Previously I've always told people I'd "work on it when I get home" and then would never end up doing the thing. But I really wanted to get remote work down, because home is where I'm most comfortable, and if I can learn to free myself from the distractions that come with it, I can really relax and get stuff done. Game Time was a pretty rough first experience where I didn't accomplish my goal and had to pull an all-nighter to finish, but I haven't done an all-nighter since then and I feel really good about separating work time and fun time.  
I don't know if I had any communication goals since I didn't do any pair work, but I'm learning (very late) that I need to work on communicating not with my class so much, but with my instructors. I haven't achieved this because I haven't yet tried, but I've been getting a lot of advice from others on how they go about making their needs clear and helping me craft my own little 'speech'.

* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: -

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?

I definitely think doing the projects alone really helped, even if I hated doing Weatherly alone. Game Time really solified inheritance for me. Dealing with fetch calling the API on Weatherly was the rough patch for me, I really began doubting I could do it by myself. It felt really hard to reach out to classmates and ask them things because I didn't want to take up their time on my project, because I felt like I was expected to already know everything since I was repeating. So feeling a bit isolated was the most challenging from me, but people are more willing to help than I realize to I just need to ask.  

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

Like I said before, my biggest study habit hangup was the fact that I get too easily distracted at home but I really like to BE at home. I had many more opportunities to work remotely because all of my projects were solo this inning. I think it could still use some work, but I went from getting no work done at home to getting in 4-5 hours worth of work. So it's an improvement.  

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I didn't enjoy anything about sorting suite, if I'm allowed to be honest. What was challenging was trying to get help from other people. We went to mod4 to ask questions and all they did was google Medium articles and dm them to us instead of trying to help. And everyone else got so caught up on the fact that they didn't know heap sort that they wouldn't help with the logic of the code, which is what my questions were about.   

The second portion of teaching it to the rest of the class served me a little better, by helping me figure out how to explain heap sort from start to finish. Being able to explain my code to non-tech people is something I'd like to be able to do, even if I don't necessarily want a job doing it.  

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** No partner.
* **Game:** Tron
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I really enjoyed class inheritance in game time, because I feel like I learned it so well. I think it's amazing that I can pass something down through 6 files and then just call it from a main index or something. After having everything so nicely separated into their own files like in Game Time, trying to help mod1 with their one massive pile of code is hard. Whenever I paired I had to take a few minutes just to orient myself with everything. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** No partner.
* **Spec Adherence:** -
* **User Interface:** -
* **HTML Style:** -
* **CSS/Sass Style:** -
* **JS/React Style:** -
* **Testing:** -
* **Workflow:** -
* **Code Sanitation:** -

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

In Weathrly, I enjoyed working with React & even though I learned about it really late, I liked implementing a data-cleaner for the API data, which is something my partner and I didn't do the first time through mod2. Most challenging was implementing the API in the first place. I think I'm still really easily confused by fetch calls, so if one thing is different from how I've been setting it up, I get stuck trying to understand how. I'd really like to get good at understanding how to bring in an API to a project and I plan to spend most of my break doing another mini-project with an API so that I don't get stuck on it in mod3 and can simply worry about organizing the data itself that I get back from the call.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Feedback III
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

Since this was my second time taking the storytelling session, what surprised me was how my professional story came out. It was completely different from the first one and didn't mention any of the things I had the first time through. It's weird how there's so many aspects of your life that you have to somehow pack into one concise story without rambling on anything too much, and I'm definitely still learning how to do that. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
 * Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
 * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
 * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

I really enjoyed the gear-ups this inning. The polygon parable was an eye-opener, and the visualization is amazing. I also really liked the Mod-4 "shit sandwich" gear-up I went to, I think it was the most useful job-related info session so far. Like one of the girls who led the gear-up, I'm also thinking of doing remote work, and it was really helpful to have someone whose closer to graduating, who has already done their research, speak on the topic.  

I think discussions of privilege are really important to have. I told the story about how I offended one of my friends by flaunting my privilege, and it was a good "hard lesson" to learn. I think everyone needs that lesson, or at least needs to be informed of the various ways they may be showing off their privilege without even realizing it. It's hard to say whether I could keep the conversation going in the workplace. I do feel like I have the tools, but it's also up to the people involved to be receptive to that sort of discussion and feedback.  

## Community Participation

My community participation this mod was helping my own mod2 classmates, since I'm repeating, and also pairing with mod1. I tried to help my classmates by pseudo-coding and telling them when they were going down rabbit holes, without ever straight up giving out answers unless it was for something small. For mod1 pairings, I tried my best to work with THEIR codebase, instead of making them change their whole structure, which I've had happen to me before. I also tried to make sure that at the end of the pairing, they said back to me everything that had been changed and why, so that they didn't get lost in what had changed.  

## Final Assessment

Freecodecamp has a project working with the Twitch API that I'd love to tackle and get done, because I'd really love more practice with bringing in APIs to projects. I'm also a big fan of "The Code Train" on youtube, and he's put out alot of ES6 videos that I've started to watch. I'd like to finish that video playlist.  

Since everything calms down during intermission week, I'll probably see about getting myself a mentor.
