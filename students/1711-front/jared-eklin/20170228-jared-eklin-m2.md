## Areas of Emphasis

1. learns
2. survive
3. advance

I wanted to continue improving my base level knowledge of javascript and become more involved in the community.


## Self-Evaluation

* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects


All of the projects helped build on my base javascript knowledge.  The most challenging projects were sorting suite and complete me because they were much different than anything we had done before paired with the smaller window to attemp to learn them.  I want to try to continue to keep things simple by breaking problems down into managable pieces.


### Study Habits

Nothing changed in my study habits and I feel my current habits are workin pretty well.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I did not enjoy sorting suite. I think the time crunch didn't allow people to try to build their own solutions and instead everyone relied on a couple people to figure out the solution and then memorize it because the eval was coming in quick. I do beleive it is a solid fundamental coding project but more time/struggle was needed.



### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3

I feel exactly the same as sorting suite but this project was even worse as far a group think. People were confused and didn't have time to really attempt to figure it out on their own.

## B: Group Work & Projects

I think I need to try to do less paired programming next mod.  I feel I was often most perductive when I was working on my own for short periods of time.

### GameTime
* **Partner:**  Pat
* **Game:** Centipede
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 4
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3


Game time was fun! Pat was an amazing partner and a lot of fun to work with and learn from.  It provided many technical challenges in js and the learning curve in canvas was challenging.


### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Theresea
* **Spec Adherence:** -
* **User Interface:** -
* **HTML Style:** -
* **CSS/Sass Style:** -
* **JS/React Style:** -
* **Testing:** -
* **Workflow:** -
* **Code Sanitation:** -


I enjoyed Weatherly. It was fun to be working with a front-end again and implementing React was an exciting challenge. I had a challenging pairing for this project that really slowed the pace down and I was dissapointed that we were not able to achieve a higher quality final product. 


## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

  I found the the storytelling pd to pretty usefull even though it was incredibly akward.  It's a skill that I need to improve on and I feel that this session made it a little bit easier.  The networking session was also benificial.


* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Ethics in AI
  * Tragedy of the Commons
  * Debugging the Gender Gap

 I found the ethics of AI to be an interesting discussion that was led by Mod 4 students.  I think that these sessions are valuable but often I really struggle with seing it at the time.  Usually I feel so hyper focused on whatever project that I'm working on that these sessions tend to feel like an inconvenience.  Of course I say that with the perspective of a white male, which is a privleged position.

## Community Participation

My main community parcipitation this mod came in the form of pairing with mod1 as well as fellow classmates. I also participated in code fair, which was a fun experience. I would like to become more involved in the community as a whole moving forward but it feels a bit overwelming to find the time while we are at turing.

## Final Assessment

I'm looking forward to mod 3! I think working in react will be fun and interesting. Balancing the increasing focus on job hunt/job skill with the increased technical content will be a challenge.  I'm going to enjoy some skiing over break!
