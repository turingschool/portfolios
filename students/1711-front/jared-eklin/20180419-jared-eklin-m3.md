## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

### Code Quality


* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running 

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 2 - Six to ten complaints

### Workflow

* 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.


#### Gig Spot

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.




## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jaredeklin/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

## Specification Adherence

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

- 3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored.

## Surprise and Delight
- 4 - Unicorn
- 3 - Hot Fire

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## D: Professional Skills

I enjoyed the PD sessions this mod. They felt like they were providing us with valuable tools that we are going to use in our job hunt.  The job shadow was a cool experience and I was greatful for the opportunity.

### Gear Up

The mod 4 lead gear up on public data was well done and was the most interesting student run gear up I've been forced to attend. The microaggression gear-up was enlightning. The groupthink gear-up seemed to be quite unproductive. It lacked balance and seemed to be contradictory.
