# OM SAETEHN - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
New frameworks such as React Redux, ES6 async-await and new library for Test Driven Development. In this mod we have been given more opportunities to solidify what we've learned and to implement them into various project challenges.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

### Study Habits
Repetitions help, and from that point on it is much more enjoyable to approach new problems. I find that hearing and talking through codes are very helpful for improving teamwork communication, workflow and learning.

### SWAPI-Box
Information about Starwars based on 3 different categories- People, Planets and Vehicles, with a feature to save/ unsave each card as favorites for later viewing. This project was made with React.js framework, first time implementing Async-await to fetch API, also React-router to navigate through the app.

### Personal Project (Wisdom Cookies)
Users get the satisfaction of breaking open the cookie to reveal wisdom, save it in a jar of scrollable wisdoms, or trash it. There's an Mooncake ext. feature that lets user see the moonphases within the next 4 quarters based on the current unix time.

## B: Group Work & Projects

### Headcount 2.0
This project served as practice with data manipulation and effective munging and packaging for use in a web application. The application itself is built with React with state management at the component level. Provided with data for kindergarten enrollements in districts throughout Colorado, the application allows for the user to search by district and compare the average enrollment of kindergartners in full day programs for up to two districts at a time.

### Movie Tracker
Movie Tracker is the final group project for module 3 at Turing. This project reinforced our abilities to create modular React components and test React using Jest and Enzyme. Movie Tracker also introduced us to Redux and Router. We hit the MovieDB API to get release dates, synopses and information about about current movies.

## C: Professional Skills
* **PD Sessions:**
 * Professional Storytelling: Resumes, Cover Letters, & Turing Portfolio
 * What Color is Your Parachute: Flower Exercise
 * Finding Opportunities
 * Resume Review Workshop
 * Job Search Priorities

 Turing dedicated many sessions for students to discover our developer identities and to develop expectations for our career paths so that we know what to expect from the employees and in the industry.
 
* **Gear Up Sessions:**
 * Gear Up 1: Microaggressions
 * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
 * Gear Up 3: Public Data and Changing the World (session with Mod4)

In case of microagressions, empathy is required from all sides. It is better to pose a question, opening up possibilities for conversations, rather than attacking the person. The impact is more important no matter what the intent is. The person whoâ€™s being called out, rather than getting defensive, must take responsibilities and accept growth.

Groupthink doesn't have to be good or bad, it's a process to be aware of- whether it is ourselves, the group dynamics and especially the outcomes you want to achieve from these interactions.

After having gone through some bad APIs, I've realized that gaining access to data is one of the most important ingredients as an engineer, especially if our goal is to make an impact and solve real-world problems.

## Community Participation
There hasn't been enough time to contribute more to Pahlka, or join other civic tech groups as much I'd hoped. Every now and then I sat with students from other mods and helped them answer any question they might have.

## Final Assessment
We've learned many new concepts this mod, looking forward to some downtime so I solidify what I have learned so far.
