#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chunktooth/os-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This comp was designed to become live one day with some adjustments to showcase lifetime work of my friend's dad's, who loves taking photographs during his travels. The challenge was utilizing flex-box and elements' widths to my advantage.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chunktooth/os-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I got the inspiration from making my own pedal board with friends, combining skatedecks with guitar pedals. This project really helps me discover many aspects of integrating static and responsive elements.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chunktooth/os-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Coding for social causes is definitely one of my goals. This project layout is very challening for me and requires a good amount of manipulating sub-elements. I received a few days of dead-line extension to work on responsiveness for media queries, which I'm really thankful for.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chunktooth/number-guesser)

Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
Exceptional Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

JAVASCRIPT
Data Types:
Novice Can articulate the definitions of primitive data types: strings, booleans, numbers, null, and undefined. Can articulate and describe object types: objects, arrays.
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Exceptional Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

Conditional Logic:
Novice Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Exceptional Comfortable with using callback functions where applicable. Comfortable returning collections from functions (objects, arrays).

Arrays:
Novice Can create array and use array indexing to extract data from array or modify array. Comfortable using arrays to store simple data types: numbers, booleans, or strings.
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
Exceptional Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

Objects & Prototypes:
Novice Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
Exceptional Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object literals in their code, and leverages more advanced object prototype methods. 

DOM Manipulation:
Novice Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style:
Novice Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
Exceptional Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

GIT & GITHUB
Git:
Novice Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

Exceptional Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

DESIGN
Comp Recreation:
Novice Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

PAIRING
Collaboration:
Novice Can communicate needs, expectations, scheduling constraints through a DTR, effectively creating a working plan with partner.
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chunktooth/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project is similar to the previous one. Refactoring others' codes and approaches to JS logic improve my understanding of JS capabilities.

DESIGN/COMP
Made it through the middle of Phase 3 with strikethrough persisting!
Colors work together; however, cork background is kind of busy and distracting
Be sure to test for edge cases - when more text is entered for task section, words overflow from card
Use round button with checkbox for Task Completed to align with other buttons on card
No visual indication of when the submit button is disabled/enabled

HTML
Good job using labels - next time use aria-label attribute on inputs instead of label elements (since you are not using a visible label)
Be sure to run your app through a screen reader - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.
Path for jquery file is not correct in line 40

CSS
Nice work updating the media queries in CSS
Love the #555555 hex code - 55555555555
Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing declarations
Continue to use console for debugging/checking to see that declarations are doing something

JS
Nice work with using named functions for event handlers
What default behavior are you preventing in line 13?
Easy to follow/read the code. Functions are single responsibility
Some naming could be adjusted for clarity - showTask
Unused var in line 83 - jus return the retrievedKey that has been parsed. No need to save it in a variable to return:
return JSON.parse(retrievedKey);
Opportunites for refactoring with editTitle/editTask using .find()

## D: Professional Skills
It has been very helpful that Turing encourages students to start thinking and developing lifetime professional mindsets from the get-go.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

It can be very challenging to learn something completely new and different compared to previous experiences, I believe everyone who has switched career paths and come to Turing possess growth mindset to begin with. Going through these thought processes again throughout Mod 1 not only helps me put philosophy to test, it's a good motivation for a lifetime.

#### Stress Management

* [Slide URL](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/U794DR5KL/F8R3RGX9B/well-being_self_care_101.pptx)

Self-care is very important for learning at one's best abilities, we are to remain aware of our own state of mind and well-being. It was good to see how this session was helpful to fellow classmates, it will be helpful to look back on this session and help other people unwind in the future.

#### Leaarning from Struggle

* [URL](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-reframing-your-failures-will-actually-bring-success.html)

Because we constantly try to improve, it helps to rethink about past struggles. From this session failures are reframed. I identify with the fact that the only true failure is when we give up, also I think that self-humiliation in a small dose is humbling and healthy for me, so that I do not view failure as taboo and repeat the same mistakes.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

It's inspiring to see how others learn and go through challenges, it also reminds me of what I still don't know. I will continue to support others whenever I can, and I would like to be able to mentor someone in the future. I'm also very proud to become a part of student groups, whether it is a small study group, Asian student association and women developers society.
