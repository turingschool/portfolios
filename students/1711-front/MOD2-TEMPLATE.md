-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects in this mod are the workings of data structures as a class and a personal learning journey with sandbox for getting started in React.js. Being introduced to new concepts are challenging but not impossible to wrap my head around once given more time and more repetitions.

### Study Habits

There are challenges and distractions back home, but it can be improved so that I can focus on study and work better next mod.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

This project brings complex logic and inner workings of sorting methods into visualizations through codes- which was also the most challenging part. When the class works together, it's enjoyable to explain the codes and our understanding to each other.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

Understanding data structures to manipulate data and utilizing it for an auto-completion feature is one of the hardest and trickiest concept yet.

## B: Group Work & Projects

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Michael Gatewood
* **Game:** Tron Legacy
* **Functional Expectations:** N/A
* **User Interface:** N/A
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** N/A
* **JS Style:** N/A
* **Workflow:** N/A

Getting used to HTML Canvas was challenging at first, combining design and trigonometry was all new to me and my partner. But we had a good communication and pushed through all the challenges thrown our way.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Aldo Mercado
* **Spec Adherence:** N/A
* **User Interface:** N/A
* **HTML Style:** N/A
* **CSS/Sass Style:** N/A
* **JS/React Style:** N/A
* **Testing:** N/A
* **Workflow:** N/A
* **Code Sanitation:** N/A

After 2 previous projects which were abstract, it was refreshing to get back into more interactive sides of coding again. Building an app that has a real use- utlizing API from an actual weather forecast website with methods we never knew we could do before. My partner and I work great together as a team, with good and laid-back communication.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Feedback III
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

The biggest challenge when giving feedback is not coming off too strong without any constructive criticism. To overcome, practicing speaking mindful honesty will be the most helpful, eventually improving communication that leads to positive outcomes. Reaching out to the community inside and outside of Turing will be beneficial to broaden my networking and getting inpirations from other people. It is important to know my goals and how to share that story to inspire other people, too.


* **Gear Up Sessions:**
 * Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
 * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
 * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

Everything worthwhile in life comes with a price, nothing is uplifting all of the time. When engaging in a new project, new relationship, new hobby, new job.. the question is not about whether of not we have a passion for it, it’s about whether or not we’re passionate enough to tolerate the struggles and make a sacrifice once things become challenging.

Diversity is the key to expanding ideas beyond our backgrounds and familiarities, it is the key ingredients to innovation. If team members all looks alike, thinks alike and share similar backgrounds and interests, the team risks the chance for growth and to expand their visions, only limited by their chosen bubble. It will also create and add injuries to sterotypes in our society. Demonstrating that diversity might not always lead to satisfaction, our society is not about individual group of people, but the more biased our society becomes the more segregrated it becomes too. 


## Community Participation

A few backenders have asked me for some help on CSS and JS, I got to pair with a few Front End students. Recently decided to join Pahlka and looking into coding for social causes.

## Final Assessment

More practices on array prototype methods so I would be more confident with larger object manipulation down the road. I'm looking forward to some down time so that I can also solidify what I have learned so far.

# Outcome:
