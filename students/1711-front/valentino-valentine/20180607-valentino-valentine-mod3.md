## B: Individual Work & Projects
I have really enjoyed the projects this mod and appreciated the cirriculum how much of a learning experience I had with all of my partners

### SWAPI Box
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/valentinovtino/SwapiBox)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI Box uses the Star Wars API to display information about the people, planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars franchise. A user can add/remove favorites and view them in the favorites tab. I was able to complete all iterations and implemented one extension to persist favorites in local storage.

### Gear Up
[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)
I loved this sesssion. It was amzing to take the time to recognize some of the influences of microaggressions and it was amazing to share that space with my fellow chort memebers.

[Code Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)
Every time I see this movie I always end up gaining a new perspective. The question that always resonanats with me is "what have I done and doing to help this issue"  

[Winning Through Failure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/winning_through_failure.md)
As someone who has experience alot of failures here at Turing it is always great to hear that these failures are in no way setbacks. Looking forward to fail more and harder.

## E: Community Participation
This session, I contributed to the community via Iron FE and pairing with Mod 2 students, queerQoders, and Turing BSA. I enjoyed collaborating with others and networking with other developers in and outside of Turing.
