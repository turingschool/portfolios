# THERESA MARQUIS - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_
Learning goals are always to improve as a pair-coding partner and address the Mod2 curriculum with full attention and effort.  I have achieved these goals.

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: _3_
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: _3_
* **C: Professional Skills**: _3_
* **D: Community Participation**: _4_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _3_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

My greatest challenge and achievement was working independently on what should have been a paired project.  I stay connected to the work, regardless of the personal toll it took.  I intend to remain fully invested in the learning opportunities that are presented.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_ 

I still am a plodder in my learning style, though not quite as much so as when I started at Turing.  I am ever interested in ways to accelerate and maximize my learning styles.  

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_ 

Learning the sorting suite is a foundational piece of a coder's repertoire for technical interviews.  Having invested the time to learn it in Mod 2 will make reviews for tech interviews easier, hopefully.  I love the dynamic of the class collaboration.  It was a very much more enjoyable experience than GameTime.  I had a great Weatherly partner which made Weatherly as enjoyable as the Sorting Suite

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **Code Sanitation:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete me, and learning about tries in general, was extremely interesting!  Again, foundational information for a programmer and I am so happy to have had the learning opportunity.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I intend to work as hard as I can.  I am already at almost full capacity, but I will not slack off.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Eloi_
* **Game:** _Snake_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_ 

Of all of the projects from Mod 2, GameTime was the most challenging, since it is designed to be a paired project.  Such a high level of stress impairs learrning, so I am pleased with my perseverance, but disappointed in my learning.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Jared Ecklin_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_ 

I always try to be the best partner I can be to my partner.  Jared has greater technical strength but I was still able to contribute and learn. I really look forward to getting more knowledge of the testing and React that was introduced in Weatherly

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices & Leadership
  * Feedback II
  * Feedback III
  * Storytelling II
  * Outreach & Networking

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_  I was a little surprised to learn that 4 out of 5 of my stregth fall into the strategic category.  I hope to get better use of the talent as I go forward.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
  * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
  * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_ Gear up sessions are very excellent opportunities for personal reflection.  I appreciate learning about the mathematical foundation that supports taking pro-active changes to offset bias in order to see the results spread in society.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_ I did a lot of dishes, I got ibuprophen for JCS, I got dry erase markers for each of my classmates for Valentines.  I made a few brownies and cinnamon rolls and bowls of popcorn for weekends.  

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_ I am absolutely going to continue to look for opportunities to learn more quickly and grow coding proficiency more in line with my own expectations for myself.
