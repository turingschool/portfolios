# Matt Walker - M3 Portfolio

## Front-End

My goal in Mod 3 was to come in early, stay late and learn how to build apps using React, Redux and Router. I feel like I accomplished this goal and am comfortable building things with React, Redux and Router.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Group Think

This sessions helped me become aware of instances of group think I had not realized before, both positive and negative. Our group talked about how group think differs between cultures and positive and negative examples of GroupThink. The most fascinating part of the conversation was about how social media is amplifying group think.

#### MicroAgressions

Microagressions are subtle, unconscious reactions, intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile or negative messages to people of marginalized groups. I found this session valuable because it made me more aware of times when I may have unconsciously microagressed. I thought it was interesting to learn how important body language is and that non-verbal cues can be microaggressions. 

#### Tech in Medicine

I found this session valuable because it covered where technology in medicine currently is, where it may be headed and what are some ethical implications of those technological advances. I appreciate the mod 4 leaders for facilitating a fair discussion and presenting a great TED talk as a baseline. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I led Iron FE twice this mod and tried to help out Mod 1 and 2'ers whenever they asked.
