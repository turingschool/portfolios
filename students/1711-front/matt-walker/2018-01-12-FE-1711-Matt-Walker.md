# Matt Walker - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I entered Mod 1 with a bit of experience in JS, HTML and CSS and I wanted to get better at each and fill in all of my gaps. I wanted to establish good habits early including coming in early, reviewing the lessons ahead of time and getting a lot of reps in on small code problems. I'm satisfied with the results and will try to keep these habits up into Mod 2.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mttwlkr/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was the first project I done that incorporated JS, CSS and HTML in one file and it gave me a good understanding of how all three languages work together. I enjoyed this project.

##### Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice html and css, a few spots to refactor but overall tidy and well factored
- Well thought through code base, both could speak to what was going on

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Ryan Harrington)
Hi Matt, here is the feedback from your partner “Matt, I think we did a great job on the project. We’re both willing to work nights, mornings, weekends so that worked well for us. The only issues with our project were pretty small, H1 not scaling on same line, URL validation, and you did find a solution for that but decided to maintain the integrity of the project instead of turning it into a copy/paste project. I appreciate that. The time we put into these areas will pay dividends that a quick fix that we don’t necessarily understand as well wouldn’t have. You have a deeper understanding of the concepts than I do, and were really good about keeping me up to speed when you would solve a problem faster than I would. I never felt lost or like I didn’t understand what was going on. The big coaching feedback going forward would be just to keep in mind that you’re pretty advanced in the class so keep walking that line between pushing yourself and ingraining it by talking it through your partner. And definitely no more index folders... All in all, I think we worked really well together.  ”

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Theresa Marquis)
- Hey Matt, here is your feedback from Theresa “Matt, it was a pleasure and a learning experience to partner with you!  I so appreciate the commitment, hard work, and energy that you brought to our project.  We have talked a lot about partnering vs. pairing.  We both have room to improve in our pairing, but I am so grateful to have had you as a partner while I was making some important realizations that will serve as a good starting point for my learning in my next partner project.  The coding you brought to the project is first rate, in my opinion.  I thank you!!”

##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

#### COMMENTS

##### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
- PUMPED that you decided to tackle working with time and using the MomentJS library
- Like the changes you made so that Show More ToDos button only appears when there are more than 10 todos
- Not sure about that gradient - but other colors work together
- Redesign the Completed Task button so that it looks like a button. No indication that is a button or clickable
- Like that you worked in the ability to filter for more than one importance type

##### HTML
- Nice job with labels and other ARIA attributes - especially the use of landmark roles
- Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - main form does pretty ok... checkboxes for filtering do well... but the dynamically generated cards are not fully accessible.

##### CSS
- Set font-size on your html selector. Also note that setting the font-size in px (line 9) runs into accessibility issues - as it will override any browser settings set by the user. Setting this to a percentage avoids this. 62.5% would be the equivalent of 10px. See this article for a more detailed explanation


##### JS/jQuery
- Good refactoring of event listeners to named functions
- Continue to work on naming. Good work with being more verbose but some naming still makes the code hard to follow - like cardAppendAdjust, cardAdjust, and timeIfElse. It is not clear what these functions do based on names
- Unclear why classes are being passed around in JS that are controlling CSS. Use add/remove/toggle for CSS classes when necessary
- In line 116 (and elsewhere) use boolean instead of 0 vs 1 for completed vs non-completed
- Importance array can be saved/accessed directly in constructor function instead of created and returned from function
- Opportunities for refactoring with append/prepend as well as other functionality around voting, importance, title/task
- Great work getting things refactored from inherited repo, overall

##### Git & GitHub
- Be sure to name branches/PRs descriptively - for features
- Stay consistent in being verbose/concise with commits

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Patrick McLaughlin)
  - 2DoBox was a pretty fun project for us. I think we both made a lot of improvements in our ability to refactor a codebase, as well as improving our ability to pass information between functions. Additionally, you were very strong with your attention to UI design for the pivot portion of our project, which I will have to carry over into my future projects. Also, you were strong when it came to talking through what goal we had for a particular function so that we kept it as dry as possible. One thing that I think both of us could improve upon in future projects is our naming conventions in our JS functions. It became a little evident that our current naming was not particularly strong when it came time for us to talk through our code with others. Overall, this project was a big success as we made it through all three phases as well as the extensions. I look forward to collaborating again with you in the future.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

I liked the Growth Mindset Gear Up. It was important for me to define what a growth mindset is because it was something I had sensed before, but didn't know there was terminology around it. A younger me did not have this mindset, I sucked at something and thought I always would. This Gear Up gave me some extra tools to maintain a mindset that I may not be that good now, but I will work and I will become better at anything I want, including coding. 

#### Health and Wellness Part 2

* [GitHub URL]()

I enjoyed the Health and Wellness sessions. The 2 minute periods where we meditated in class really helped me. I was feeling stressed and anxious and taking a step back and focusing on the present, just breating, and noticing what is happening around me helped me think clearer. I have used some of the techniques taught in this session at Turing since this session. Please keep doing these sessions for future Mod 1's. 

#### Mod 4 Leads

* [GitHub URL]()

I enjoyed the presentation by the Mod4 students on Technology in the Media. It was good to bring awareness to the fact most of your sources that you get news and information from may not be valid. The Mod 4 students did a good job hosting it and the discussion was interesting. Also, I now know what Phishing is. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a Turing n00b, I wasn't able to do much to give back, but I made an effort where I could. I attended the Mod3/4 Community Presentations before I came to Turing. I went to every guest speaker I could, I really enjoyed both Jeff and Kara from KPMG's presentations. I tried to help my class mates out when they needed help going into the Pentathalon and held a session on Mythical Creatures.
