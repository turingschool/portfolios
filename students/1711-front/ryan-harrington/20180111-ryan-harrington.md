Ryan Harrington - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn as much as I could this module. I didn't know much about coding so I didn't have any particular goals in mind yet. I just wanted to do well on everything assigned. I learned a lot about coding, about the community, and what some of the possibilites are. I set out to make my goals more specific, and I've done that every week and added to them.

Feedback

“I think we did a great job on the project and worked well together. I admire how motivated you were to work on the project together, at Turing, over the weekend. Thank you for helping me in CSS on when to use percentage width and pixel width. I appreciate you bringing things up in Javascript that you didn’t understand. These questions made it so we were both on the same page and could move forward together. I remember you saying you want to work on specificity in typing and specificity in Javascript and I saw growth in both areas by the end of the project. We could be more effective in pairing again if we built better systems of communication, including answering slack and imessage consistently.  We could also set up specific workflow for what to do in person and what to do remotely.”

### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RyanH5/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Create a webpage that locally stores ideas with associated quality that can be removed later.
Partner: Charles Yach

Notes/What To Work On:
DESIGN/COMP
Nice job getting as far as you did!
Some adjustments needed with spacing and font size
HTML
Good job with indentation/spacing
Use aria-label where you are using the name attribute for accessibility (using the aria-label attribute instead of label elements since you are not using a visible label). Instances where you might use name include:
allowing inputs to provide their values to the server (of which we have none) on form submission.
grouping radio buttons so that only one can be selected at a time.
Correct your path in line 32 so that jquery loads as backup, if needed
Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.
CSS
Consider adding comments to your CSS for organizatonal purposes
Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing declarations
Don't put units on 0 (line 8) - it's redundant
Remove commented out code from final submission
Use ems or rems for font sizes - don't rely on pixel density with so many user devices out there now
Avoid the use of IDs as CSS selectors to avoid specificity issues when your codebase grows
Love that you discovered (and implemented) using attributes as CSS selectors. However, see information on name (HTML above) as to WHEN you should be using the name attribute. Currently, it is an addition that you are using in the same manner that you would use an id or class.
JS
Bs sure you get familiar with your terminology (i.e. template literals, properties, etc)
Event listeners could be refactored to use named functions instead of anonymous functions
Don't create a variable idea in line if there is a possibility it will go unused (if the if expression evaluates to true). Move around your logic so that a new Idea instance is created ONLY when both fields have content.
Difficult to read through some of the JS functions - for example, the event listeners for editing the title/body. Spacing within functions also adds to difficulty across entire file
Default to using dot notation when accessing values from static properties (for readability). Also - remove unneccesary parens in expression (See example in line 113 below)
if (parsedIdea.quality === 'quality:swill') {
  ...
}
Duplicate lines of sending to local storage and showing updated quality text on screen (in event listeners for quality buttons) ...this could be moved out of the conditional to be executed at the end of the function, once the new quality has been assigned
Event listeners for editing title and body could be refactored into one function
Good naming on those functions that are named
GIT/GITHUB
ALWAYS work on branches
Nice job being specific in your commit messages!

Feedback

“”Appreciation: Ryan, it was awesome to work with you. I loved your no bullshit and straight forward approach. You know your strengths, you know your challenges, and you move forward from there fully aware of how things are going to go down. You have amazing commitment to the project and are willing to work at all cost to get it right. I appreciate your planning ahead to get us pairings when we needed it the most. With both of us having the same challenges from our previous projects, it was nice to tackle them with someone who is on equal ground.

Coaching: Dude, you gotta take care of yourself. I love that you are putting everything you have into this class and our project, but your health is just as important. I would rather get a lower grade and you in good health than a high grade and you destroyed. It will also help your learning. If you are barely getting through the motions, you won’t retain the knowlege that the project is trying to impose.“”


### ToDoBox - Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RyanH5/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Refactor a classmates IdeaBox code. Should be able to add new to-do's, edit to-do's, remove to-do's, and filter by quality.
Partner: Keila Hoover

Notes/What To Work On:
comp
use device tools ie. iphone 5
html
good use of aria labels
css
consider adding comments and using bem
less is more with media queries make the content conform to your media queries
js
decouple data from the markup
find duplicate chunks of code and pass difference as an argument

"It was great working with you, Ryan! Surprisingly, us remotely working wasn’t as stressful as I expected. The fact that we were both willing to jump on screen share when the other was struggling on an issue helped cap the struggles a lot sooner. Us having similar paces made the project go smooth and created more motivation for myself. I enjoyed how easily we were able to communicate about scheduling and troubleshooting. 

The only coaching I have is prepare for what is to come. For example, create a checklist of tasks for a project so you don’t feel overwhelmed or confused once you get to that point of the project. All in all, you are a great partner with chill vibes. Hope we can partner again soon!"


## D: Professional Skills
These are the professional skills I developed.

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness (pt 1)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

The first health and wellness was all about learning about stress, how we deal with it, and get a little insight into how others may deal with it. This gives us a little deeper understanding of ourselves, how we might react in a given situation, how to think about it to improve the outcome. Learning how people around you might deal with stress lets you know when to act, maybe why they're acting the way they are, and how it affects them. All parties being armed with this information, could help a workplace, relationships, etc.

#### Health and Wellness (pt 2)

The second health and wellness related to how our individual energy interweaves into a larger fabric. Learning how deep the effects of exposure to nature has made me both miss all the time I used to spend outdoors and buy an indoor plant for my apartment. I related a lot of the information in that class to what my fiance, who's a teacher has taught me about behavior. We all grew up no fidgeting in class, keep your hands off your face, etc. And while that all makes sense, some people, myself included focus more intently with specific sensory stimulation. When I'm deep in thought, I generally put my my hand on my face with my thumb under my chin, and index finger up along the side of my face. I never even really noticed it until Laura told me about that.  

#### Jobs from Blogs

I chose the blog session because I know talking about myself is something I need to improve at. This is kind of a middle-ground where I can focus on the career, or technical subject I choose to write on. The big take-away is that you can write about something even if you don't consider yourself an "expert" at it. Getting the ball rolling by starting the conversation, or asking a question is equally important as having the knowledge. Other people might use what you write to go on to do something great. The discussion on your blog could have the key that someone needed to create a cure for cancer, therefore: you could cure cancer with a blog.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always help out someone who asks for help or if they look like they're stuck, if I can. If not, I try to learn it with them from someone else. I don't ask myself what Turing can do for me. I ask what I can do for Turing.
