# RYAN HARRINGTON - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

tech skills- My learning focus this mod was array prototypes. After hearing the previous mods war stories, I made array prototypes a large priority. The other thing I really focused on before the mod and in the beginning was learning canvas, because I'd been really excited about making a game since I first saw them here. In retrospect, I was probably missing the forest by looking at the tree because I didn't realize that canvas was more of a vehicle for learning about classes, es6, etc. than it was about canvas. Either way, that was my favorite project.

communication- The growth I wanted to see in non-tech areas became more apparent through the gearups, though admittedly I never wanted to go to them. For example, making my story sound more positive is definitely on the to-do list. I've always been mixed on the feedback, but I was looking at it in the wrong context. I think I just prefere an 'agile' feedback process as opposed to the 'waterfall' alternative. Having a continuous two way feedback stream by keeping the dialog open and communicating issues and success along the way is my preferred method. Obviously ensuring that feedback is kind and actionable is the only way to work with people. 

## Self-Evaluation
I made really solid gains on all of the technical areas I focused on. Going from semi-competence with array prototypes to steadily knocking down deeply nested array-object-array-array-objects has been really rewarding. I've been able to make these improvements by focusing on my process. When I get lost I can normally work back from the beginning and find where I went astray, which is really helpful.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Sorting suite was kind of a big step, that definitely helped me with process, understanding recursion, and translating a process into code. The weekend right before kickoff, it seemed incomprehensible how to put all this card movement into code, but after the live bubble code it came together. So that went from very daunting, to the night before the eval, being able to do all 4 back to back pretty quickly without any real hiccups. Complete-me was very challenging. The numbers of sorting-suite were easier for me to wrap my head around, though I know some people felt the opposite. 

### Study Habits

The difficulty really amped up this mod I thought. My studying was pretty good. I couldn't stop thinking about coding at night which was messing up my sleeping schedule, causing an increased caffeine intake to be on it during the day, which then on top of thinking about coding while laying in bed my heart was beating like a jackrabbit. So this breakweek is literally like a necessity right now.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I really enjoyed sorting-suite once I got off the ground. Gametime vs sorting suite working with people gave exposure to completely opposite types of working together. Gametime was very one-on-one. Sorting-Suite and complete-me were more like class mission to learn and be able to produce projects. Which was interesting to see, it was a big class dynamic but it naturally breaks down way farther than that. People end up pairing down to groups of two or three. Then when they get stuck, get ideas from other people who have gone a similar path. That's complete me. Sorting suite maybe doesn't pair down quite so definitively.

## B: Group Work & Projects

The groupwork aspect of sorting suite and complete me was totally new. So that was good exposure to get an idea of what working in a large team might be like. The difference being that we're all creating the same thing instead of all creating different pieces of the same thing. However, all the same interpersonal skills apply. If you're difficult or unpleasant to work with, that would make these projects a lot harder. Because as the group would come to collective revelations, you might be kind of grinding it out by yourself not getting the ideas as quickly as the collective.

I loved Gametime. That was something I'd waited for since first getting here. The biggest challenges were: dealing with file structure issues from initially going too far in the index file, and collision detection. Collision detection took up a large percentage of our time once we learned how to set up our files, use classes, etc, and while I get that might not be the point, to me that was huge. Initially getting the big win of "YES, they collided we're basically done" to finding out as soon as you speed them x/y-dir up that they jump over each other. Trying probably 5 completely different methods, and ending on the circles and using the pythagorean theorem without crashing into yourself immediately on spawn. That was the highlite of my mod.

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
Learning React is awesome. Finding out how modular and powerful it is was awesome. The testing is tough and fully wrapping my head around the aynchronous JS, particularly with testing will be a solid task. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3
  https://gist.github.com/RyanH5/0b46c5a3ffdd46d532089106e0f3c5fd
  Learning about the benefits of improving my linkedIn game.

  Professional Story
  https://gist.github.com/RyanH5/ab974cfce868339f9f07c7712b61fbd9
  I learned that my story when I say it aloud, sounds negative. I don't really think it sounds that way, but other people seemed to, so making an attempt to keep a postive sounding light on it will be important moving forward.

  Feedback 2
  https://gist.github.com/RyanH5/2555ea2517ec99b9ab6c01c205d8b4ef
  I found that I prefer an agile feedback process.


  Agile
  https://gist.github.com/RyanH5/d4249fbdc97db29b5f053c61d5eb43b9
  Attempting to use an agile process, to eat the elephant one bite at a time, has been beneficial.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
 Empathy
 - It's basically just being patient, and treating people decently. If you think you've got it bad, it's realistically just that day, and knowing how lucky you are. 

 Group Think
 - To be aware of the downsides, and recognizing the upsides. To recognize when you're thinking the same way following the mob, and when to do that or not do that.

 Public Data
 - Knowing what all is out there as far as mass public data, private data, etc. To be persistent, and use it for good.


## Community Participation

I ran a mythical creatures session. I paired with mod 1 a good bit initially. Then I reduced my pairings, and would answer questions and specific problems they'd have. Next mod I plan on being very active in the mythical creatures assessments. 


## Final Assessment

My bachelor party is this weekend. So I plan to do some mountain biking and beer drinking. Then I plan to dive deeper into React, maybe check out Redux from a high level. Other than that, just keep chopping those vegetables. Keeping my Repl game strong.
