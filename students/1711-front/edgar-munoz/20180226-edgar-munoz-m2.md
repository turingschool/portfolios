## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I wanted to solidify my understanding of array prototypes and start working on React in preparation for mod3

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### Study Habits

This mod I focused on balancing work and practice with protecting my own wellness through wellness practices. I feel that I was successful in learning the curriculum without over-working myself.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

For this project, we implemented four fundamental sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insert sort, quick sort, merge sort. Whereas with GameTime we worked in pairs, for Sorting Suite the class worked together, making the process of finding solutions much easier and more collaborative. This project improved my ability to think algorithmically.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 4
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3.5
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

For this project, we had to build a trie data structure. My Complete Me project includes an insert method, suggest method, and delete method. Like Sorting Suite this project was completed by the class working together and it continues the pattern of thinking algorithmically and understanding what code does behind the scenes.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Mike Duke
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3.5
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3.5
* **JS Style:** 3.5
* **Workflow:** 3.5

Our GameTime project was Frogger. For this project we implemented HTML Canvas to draw out a game and used JS to make it interactive.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Charles Yach
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

Weathrly is the first project using React that we were assigned, in preparation for a more intensive React dive in mod3. It was a sufficient and challenging intro. Our objective was to build a weather app that displays current, daily, and hourly weather based on geolocation. Sass was also implemented for the first time.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _List here_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
  * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
  * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

Our gearups this mod continue to build on inclusivity and developing the skills needed to bridge gaps. The Tragedy of the Commons gearup showed us how not having a bias isn't enough. We need to develop an anti-bias in order to create a more diverse and inclusive environment. My GearUp session with Mod4 was about managing stress. We learned some very useful tactics to manage our time here at turing and beyond. The empathy and privilege gearup was about recognizing your blind spots and privileges, something that's very useful if we want to change the world of coding.

## Community Participation

This mod I was able to pair with students in mod 1 on projects and during mythical creatures sessions. I attended some LGBT coder meetups and was able to find someone who was willing to mentor me. I also paired with students in Mod3 (Ophus has been a solid support).

## Final Assessment

Over intermission I will continue to practice React to prepare myself for mod3. Maybe look into Redux. I want to go into mod3 flying. I also want to continue to build my relationships with mod 1710 as I still feel a connection with them. :)
