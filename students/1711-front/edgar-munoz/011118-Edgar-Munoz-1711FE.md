Notes/What To Work On:
In future projects, push yourself further. You easily could've gotten through phase 4!
Make sure that the buttons are actually disabled and not only giving the appearance
html
Use forms and labels for all inputs
css
Try adding comments for better organization ie. nav styles, form styles, etc.
js
Use semicolons
Try using more local variables and pass them around as arguments
Could pull out the reassignment of guessFeedback into a function that takes an argument of the message to be displayed
Functional Expectations
Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

Notes/What To Work On:
OVERVIEW
YAY for making it through all of Phase III and most of IV! Nice work doing a DTR and checking in w/your partner. Love that you are placing learning as a priority.
DESIGN
Error messaging should have more direct instructions for avoiding the error
Knock the red down on your clear read buttons, fix spacing between inputs
Hard to read the read bookmarks text on the screen
HTML
Lines 3-25 should be indented two more spaces to align with HTML Style Guide
Like that you are using aria-required and lang attributes! Add labels to your inputs.
CSS
Good commenting for organization in CSS
Use ems or rems for font sizes - don't rely on pixel density with so many user devices out there now
Add box-sizing: border-box to override default box-sizing to make sure boxes are the exact width you set.
  *, *:before, *:after {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; 
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box; 
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }*
Use background-color not background to set the color for sections (Lines 6, 31, 40, 71, 78, 83, 87, 91) Don't mix color names and hex codes in your CSS file - pick one and stay consistent
Avoid the use of IDs as CSS selectors to avoid specificity issues when your codebase grows
Use reset or normalize file to avoid declarations where you undo default styles
JS
Like that you are using named functions for event listeners
Opportunities for refactoring in JS: break apart bookmarkCreate
Hooray for knowing what this is within your toggleRead
Work on naming conventions. Some parts of the code are hard to follow due to naming
GIT/GITHUB
Like that you are commenting on your PRs. Nice use of branches to separate features.
Work on being concise and descriptive in naming for commits
Functional Expectations
(Link for url does not redirect and URL validation is not working)

Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Pairing/Collaboration
Proficient

Edgar, I really enjoyed working in our paired project.  Specifically, your willingness to create a thorough DTR and revisit it mid-project gave us a great space for addressing conflicts we were experiencing.   Our collaborative spirit in the project even increased after that mid-project discussion.  For consideration: Just right before the the final eval we were slacked to submit our git links, which you did do, but you didn’t let me know you had.  I had not forked the repo to my git so I had a spike of anxiety trying to get that done so I could send in the link.  (I could have slacked your github repo path.)  It was a small thing and you had it covered for both of us.  I just had a few moments of last minute worry until I saw you and asked you about it.  I will take the great pairing experience I had with you as a fond Turing memory!  I admire the patience and calm that you bring to the driver-navigator process.  If I learned anything from our pairing, it was what a huge advantage it is to a project to keep patient and calm!  Thank you!!”

Student: Steven and Edgar
Evaluator: David
Notes/What To Work On:
I don't think that I expressed this clearly enough during the eval, but I'm very dissapointed with how this project went. I expected better from both of you.
Going forward I think it would be better to have less functionality, and tighter code throughout than to have more functionality and sloppy code/implementation.
This project seemed like there was a huge lack of effort and organization. Be intentional with the code you write and follow the spec to a T.
comp
Pay attention to the details! Spacing and proportions were off, I'd expect ideas to be added to the top of the list instead of the bottom. It felt like a lot of decisions were made purely on laziness.
html
label you input fields!!!(whether that be label elements or aria-labels)
css
consider organizational comments and using bem
pick a convention for organization within rules and a way for organizing the rules themselves. Any convention.
js
pull duplicate blocks into functions and pass whatever is dynamic as an argument
good naming convention for your constructor function
use more action like names for functions - ie. modifyBody not modifiedBody
git/github
get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!
Functional Expectations
Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
CSS
Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
DOM Manipulation
Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
GIT & GITHUB
Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Github
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
PAIRING
Collaboration
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

“I learned some good stuff working with you on ideabox: the utility of the git workflow by creating a new branch for every component (need to give the branches more serious names), changing my dev tools to a much better dark theme, and I really appreciated you tackling the localStorage when I was confused where to start. I think in the future, don’t hesitate to call someone out when naming their branches weird things, as well as maybe going through code a partner has written to make sure nothing was overlooked. Cheers!”

Evaluator: Louisa
Notes/What To Work On:
UI needs polishing, doesn’t break down to smaller screens smoothly.
CSS needs a refactor pass.
JS still has quiet a few opportunities to refactor and reduce duplication
make sure you are pushing hard and really tightening up the last 10% of the project. There are lose ends that you had time to address, and you’re selling yourselves short by not pushing hard to make things as tight as possible.

We worked very well together, this was the easiest project expect for last function. We both need to timebox our struggles. We also should use the pom timers we downloaded. There was a few times you went off on something where I had no idea what you were doing. Thank you for teaching me about unit testing I feel a lot better for the final. Excited to work with you again

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

I learned that having a growth mindset is more conducive to learning. I got an opportunity to practice it and continue to develop an even better growth mindset.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

It's important to deal with people differently depending on where they fall on the introversion to extroversion scale. Different people work with groups differently and have different pairing methods. So it's important to keep that in mind.

### Strengths & Storytelling
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

It's good to know your story or pitch when you are selling yourself. I learned that I need to work on the "Why did you choose coding question".

### Gear Up
#### Tech in The Mediaa

This session was great. It was engaging. I learned about unreal news in tech and buzzwords flying around. We talked about was to resist net neutrality.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I didn't do much this time around. I feel like what I built last mod was supporting me this mod. So thanks for that to them.
