# Jonathan Sweet - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My learning focus for this inning was to continue improving readability of the code I write, understanding Redux, and to gain further practice with React. I feel that I have achieved this goal and will continue to focus on testing and refactoring code to be more readable and maintainable.

## Self-Evaluation

* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: PASS

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I feel that my individual work gave me great opportunity to practice my skills with React and understanding more complex programming architecture and patterns. The most challenging part was coming up with a personal project idea that was feasible within the time allotted.

### Study Habits

I am comfortable with my study habbits and readily implement new course learnings in to projects as my best tool for understanding new concepts.

### SWAPI-Box
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **Code Quality:** 4
* **CSS/Design:** 4
* **Testing:** 4
* **PropTypes Implementation:** 4
* **README Updates:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 4
* **Workflow:** 4

SWAPI-box was good practice with an outside API and utilizing Redux. I feel comfortable with typical Redux architecture and learned the benefits of utilizing middleware such as Saga, which I use in latter projects.

### Personal Project - Lost & Found
* **Scores:** TBD

This project was my first experience with building a server and database along with a front end in React with Redux and Saga middleware. Utilizing the Google Maps Javscript API, I learned a lot about the challenges of implementing google maps with a framework such as React and the versatility of the APIs geocoding and reverse geocoding services. Gaining experience with knex and creating postgreSQL tables was insightful and makes me excited to work on more full stack code bases.

## B: Group Work & Projects

The group projects this inning gave me more opportunity to navigate while pairing and gain experience working with multiple other devs (as opposed to just one other).

### Headcount 2.0
* **Partners:** Sabrina Kennedy and Om Saetehn
* **Spec Adherence:** 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.
* **Code Quality:** 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
* **CSS/Design:** 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.
* **Testing:** 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
* **PropTypes Implementation:** Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
* **Readme Updates:** Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
* **Code Sanitation:** 4 - Zero complaints
* **WorkFlow:** 4
* **Suprise/Delight:** 3 - hot fire

As a teammember of this group, I spent most of my time navigating while pair programming and providing direction on the project. The main lesson from this project for me was to be mindful about how I am munging and packaging data for ease of use within the application.

### MovieTracker
* **Partner:** Maddy Dannenburg & Steven Lawson
* **Spec Adherence:** 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
* **Code Quality:** 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
* **CSS/Design:** 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
* **Testing:** 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
* **PropTypes Implementation:** Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
* **Readme Updates:** Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
* **Code Sanitation:** 4 - Zero complaints
* **Redux Architecture:** 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
* **Routing:** 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
* **WorkFlow:** 4

This project helped cement my testing skills and understanding of the `async` `await` syntax rather than `.then()` for asynchronous operations.

## C: Professional Skills

**Gear Up Sessions:**
  1. Microaggressions
  2. Group Think
  3. Case Study with Mod 4 - Public Data

I find these topics to be important but I was not surprised by any of the content of the discussions. I feel like I have the tools to continue these conversations in a relevant and conscientious manner in the future. I intend to seek employment with a company that embodies a diverse, mindful culture that strives to advance gender equality and diversity. The Public Data gear-up hosted by Mod 4 was interesting and the implications of the subject matter are broad. I look forward to being apart of a software community that strives to make public data more accessible either through participation in an open source project or in my future career.

## Community Participation

This inning, I volunteered to lead Iron-FE when available and spent time pairing with mod2 students. Other than that, business as usual.

## Final Assessment

I feel very comfortable with React, Redux, middleware, utilizing external APIs, end to end testing, and understanding scalable architecture and patterns. Over the intermission, I intend to apply for jobs.

# Outcome: PASS

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3.5
* **D: Community Participation**: 4
* **E: Final Assessment**: 4
