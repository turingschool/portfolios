# Jonathan Sweet - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My learning focus for this inning was to continue improving readability of the code I write and to gain practice with OOP. I feel that I have achieved this goal although improving the readability will be an ongoing focus moving forward.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I feel that my individual work really helped me translate my understanding of algorithmic thinking and problem solving in to working code. The most challenging part was the number of times I would be asked questions or disrupted in the middle of work to help my peers. In the future, I will continue to contribute to the success of the group but I will be prioritizing my own learning by scheduling a phone booth or study room to ensure some personal space.

### Study Habits

In module 1, I would consistently read the weeks lessons ahead of time to generate any questions I would like answers to in class. That was difficult this module as a lot of the lessons were not available or would change just before the day of the lesson. Otherwise, I am comfortable with my study habits moving forward.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I enjoyed sorting suite - it gave me an opportunity to utilize my strengths and background in mathematics to be a resource for my peers. I like that this is a required project at Turing and it served to satiate my desire for a more granular understanding of what is going on under the hood with some aspects of JS.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 4
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** No score provided. 0 linter errors.

This was a fun problem to wrestle with and I am confident that I can recreate a n-ary trie or linked list with no problems.

## B: Group Work & Projects

The group projects this inning helped to keep me connected to the DOM and provided a lot of practice passing around data and instantiating objects. I feel that my partners and I got along great and we were able to consistently meet our objectives. The highlight of this module was winning the intra-school code fair with my GameTime partner.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Charles Yacht
* **Game:** Missile Command
* **Functional Expectations:** 4.1
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 4
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Work-flow:** 3

This project was super fun. I enjoyed learning about the canvas element, animation frames, and utilizing ES6 and the class syntax to take a modular approach to building our game. My partner and I worked really well together and were on the same page every step of the way. I feel like I have a good foundation to continue building upon.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Mike Duke
* **Pass/Fail:** Pass

I enjoyed learning about React and the fetch method for getting API data. I look forward to getting to work with all sorts of APIs in future modules and perfecting my testing abilities to take a proper TDD approach to future projects.

## C: Professional Skills

**PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices and Leadership
  * Feedback
  * Storytelling
  * Outreach and Networking

I appreciated most the Agile Practices and Leadership PD session as I feel it did the most to prepare me for my future professional life as a developer. I spent a number of years in sales perfecting the art of the elevator speech and I feel comfortable in my ability to revise my story for networking and outreach purposes. I have a plan of attack for networking in module three inclusive of meet-ups, leveraging mentor relationships, and starting cold outreach.

**Gear Up Sessions:**
  1. Debugging the Gender Gap
  2. Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
  3. Case Study with Mod 4 - Ethics of AI

I find these topics to be important but I was not surprised by any of the content of the discussions. I feel like I have the tools to continue these conversations in a relevant and conscientious manner in the future. I intend to seek employment with a company that embodies a diverse, mindful culture that strives to advance gender equality and diversity. The ethics of AI session hosted by Mod 4 was interesting and the implications of the subject matter are broad. I look forward to learning more over time about the advancements of AI and their impact on workforce automation and business.

## Community Participation

I was an Iron-FE regular this inning which gave me a lot of fun problems to work on and helped hone my skills at the keyboard as well as the white board. I intend to volunteer some of my time to lead Iron-FE next inning.

My game-time partner and I entered into the intra-school code-fair and took first place for our missile command game which was both flattering and validated our hard work.

I was really excited that Posses were revamped and the machine learning posse started to take off. Myself and another student took a leadership role in this posse and we had begun to set the stage to solve an interesting ML problem and engage with mentors. It has been hinted at that posses will be no more next inning, which will make me sad and feel that my time, and that of my mentors, has been wasted.

## Final Assessment

Over the intermission, I intend keep converting old projects in to React applications with TDD and will probably reproduce weatherly from scratch. I will be meeting with my mentor and updating my resume as well in preparation for the job hunt to begin. Other than that, I will be sleeping, filing taxes, and snowboarding.
