# Maddy Dannenberg - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to get a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics. My goal was to stay organized, do well on each project and read lessons ahead of time so that I could better sythesize all the information. I wanted to get involved in the Turing community and learn more about the Tech industry in general.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three static compositions.

#### Number Guesser
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mmdberg/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user chooses a range of numbers and guesses a number within the range. The application generates a random number in the range and gives feedback based on if the user guess is too high, too low or correct.

#### Static Comp Challenges

I was given a series of three static compositions and asked to recreate them with a responsive design while respecting the integrity of the original design. The creative license included copy, images, icons and color palette.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The three partner projects this mod were Linked List, IdeaBox and 2DoBox.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mmdberg/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Build an application in which a user can input and bookmark a webpage title and URL. Each bookmark should have a "mark to read" button and remove button and user should be able to see a count of all the bookmarks and all the read bookmarks.

Notes/What To Work On:
UI is a little squirrely as the screen size is reduced
some broken layout elements on mobile
good use of github, using issues and PRs
CSS could use a refactor
avoid percentages for margin and padding
absolutely positioned elements that likely don't need to be absolutely positioned

Feedback from partner: 
Hey Maddy! I’m really thankful that you were my partner for the project this week. I think we communicated our goals and needs really well right off the bat as well as throughout the project. Although we had some initial difficulties such as initiating git & GitHub, working through them with you has been beneficial. During the project you were strong and pushed through some challenging aspects of the project, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed. I really appreciate it. However, I also recognized that, partially because of what I was going through, and also how we divided the work caused me to not fully understand all aspects of the javascript. I think struggling with you in the js would have helped me to understand more. Yet I really enjoyed working with you! It was especially cool to see your perseverance and calm demeanor through tough problems. Thanks for being my partner :).

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mmdberg/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Build an application for recording and archiving ideas. The user should input and store an idea and description and be able to search through, edit, delete and change the quality of each idea. This project focused on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface by ensuring that the ideas persiste on page load.

Notes/What To Work On:
comp
  content should not get bigger as page becomes smaller, try going mobile first next time
html
  use aria labels
  store jquery locally
css
  consider organizational comments and bem
  try less in media queries
js
  pull duplicate blocks into functions
  love that you used a constructor function and especially a method on the prototype!!!
  use more abstractional naming, ie. Idea instead of MakeCard
git/github
  get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!

Feedback from partner: 
Working with Maddy on this project was both beneficial and fun! Our DTR laid out our clear expectations for where we wanted the project to go, how we were going to work together, and when we wanted it to be done. Maddy did a great job with every portion of the project that was put on her to complete. The only advice I have for Maddy to work on is something that I too want to focus on, and that would be to try to work on getting rid of repetitive code/working on building those refactoring skills that we’ve been honing since day 1.

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mmdberg/2DoBox---pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Refactor and clean up another student's IdeaBox project, focusing on deleting redundant, broken or obsolete code and making sure functions are single responsibility to improve readability and quality. Then, pivot the functionality for a site in which the user can enter a task and then filter, edit and change the importance of each task.

Notes/What To Work On:
DESIGN/COMP
  Made it through Phase 3 w/no bugs
  Like the range of colors on filtering buttons
  "Minimalized approach" makes text hard to read. Love the take on it, but bump it up a bit
  Small tweaks with spacing
  Only need filtering for importance. For the future, be sure to clarify specs with instructors when unsure
HTML
  Be sure to run your app through a screen reader - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.
CSS
  Nice job condensing a lot of the CSS
  Like to hear that you used dev tools to debug/check selectors in CSS
  Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing declarations
JS
  Global array in line 26?
  Only pass in dynamic arguments in line 50 for constructor - title, body, id. this.completed property could be set up as boolean of true/false
  Unclear why you have a prepend and append function
  At times, code can be hard to follow/read
  editContentTitle & editContentBody could be refactored to a single function. Also - be sure to priortize using dot notation over bracket notation when the property you are accessing is not dynamic (lines 131, 140):
  parsedIdea.title = $(this).html();
  Opportunites for refactoring in filtering functions
GIT/GITHUB
  Be more descriptive in naming for branches
  Pretty naming on commits - could sometimes be a bit more descriptive

Feedback from partner:
It was a pleasure working with you.  Planning out what each us should work on ahead of time was really helpful for keeping me on track.  You were mindful about giving me space to focus on coding, but also there to help when I was struggling with a problem.  Something we could work on for our next pair projects would be to walk through the code the day before the eval and practice explaining it to each other.  Overall, I think you were a great partner, and we did a great job with the project.

## D: Professional Skills

We worked on professional skills in three Gear Up sessions: Health and Wellness (pt1), Health and Wellness (pt2) and Tech in the Media.

### Gear Up

#### Health and Wellness (pt.1)

The first health and wellness session was focused on the impact of stress and nervous system regulation. I learned about eustress vs distress (good vs bad stress) and that stress can have neurological and physiological effects. I took away how it is important to recognize stress, listen to your body, breathe, and implement a resiliency mindset. 

#### Health and Wellness (pt.2)

The second health and wellness session was focused on self-care. I learned about how important self-care is for sustainability at work, creativity, and stress resilience. I have continued to think about how self-care starts with self-awareness and that we can create new norms in the tech industry. I have tried to maintain a consistent exercise and sleep schedule to maintain a healthy mental state. 

#### Tech in the Media

The community gear up I participated in was Technology in the Media, focused on tech "buzzwords." I learned about fake news and tips on how to tell what is legitimate, new neutrality and how it will affect the tech world, and social media and how it has changed the way we consume media. The main takeaway from this session was the notion that we have responsibilities as "experts" in the tech field. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended Joan Clarke Society meetings, all wrap-ups, and some happy hours to meet others in the Turing community. I scheduled pairing sessions each week with Mod 2 students and helped other classmates in Mod 1 when they asked for help or seemed to be struggling.
