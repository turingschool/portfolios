## Areas of Emphasis
_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

My goals for Mod 2 were to continue to strengthen my foundation and skills with JavasScript, get better at manipulating data involving objects and arrays and establish a base foundation with React. Additionally I wanted to learn how to break complex problems down into smaller steps. I feel like I achieved all of the goals set for this mod.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I definitely believe that the projects we had this mod helped me achieve the goals stated above. Sorting Suite and Complete Me helped me develop algorithmic thinking and Game Time And Weathrly allowed me to practice array and object manipulation. I plan to continue to dedicate time outside of the classroom to go over new concepts.  


### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

Not much changed from mod 1 to mod 2 with my study habits. I tend to dedicate time to understand all of the things we go over in class. I think that my habits are well established and they will continue to help me get through each mod.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed getting to work in bigger groups for this project. It allowed me to see the different ways my peers are able to solve the same problem. I believe this project helps you develop algorithmic thinking.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _4_
* **Testing:** _4_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I feel the same way about Complete Me as I do with Sorting Suite.


## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I had a good time working on my paired projects this mod. My partners communicated well and we stayed on track.  

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Maddy Dannenberg_
* **Game:** _Breakout_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3+_
* **User Interface:** _3+_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Game Time was a very fun project to work on. Building a game while learning made this project really enjoyable. My partner and I did a great job working together to complete each phase. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Om Saetehn_
* **Spec Adherence:** _TBD_
* **User Interface:** _TBD_
* **HTML Style:** _TBD_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _TBD_
* **JS/React Style:** _TBD_
* **Testing:** _TBD_
* **Workflow:** _TBD_
* **Code Sanitation:** _TBD_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed working on Weathrly because this was an actual app that we can use in our daily lives. Getting a solid foundation in React was very important during this project. Working on Weathrly allowed us to practice object and array manipulation.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile Practices & Leadership_
  * _Feedback II_
  * _Feedback III_
  * _Storytelling II_
  * _Outreach & Networking_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

All of the PD sessions were very informative and taught me how to be a better software developer. It is very important that we know have to give feedback to our partners. Communication plays a vital role within teams.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy & Privilege_
  * _Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think_
  * _Avoiding Burnout with Mod 4_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I feel like the Gear Ups allow us to understand one another and really get to know who you are working with. It is crucial to understand each team member so that we know how to get things done. By knowing how to interact with each team member we can accomplish things much faster.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I volunteered to help keep the mod 1/ mod 2 pairing schedule and also paired with mod 1. I also attended Iron FE and helped any of my classmates that needed assistance. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I plan on working on all of the prework for next inning and and really looking forward to working more with React.
