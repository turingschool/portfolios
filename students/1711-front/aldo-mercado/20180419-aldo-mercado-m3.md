## B: Individual Work & Projects

### SWapi Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amercado1014/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWapi-box is a react app that allows users to view Star Wars data from the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/documentation. There are four buttons that allow the user to browse through people, planets, vehicles and favorites. Users can add cards to favorites by clicking on the favorite button.

### Let's Order Out

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amercado1014/lets-order-out)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Let's Order Out is an application that allows users to view information on restaurants near them. Users can look at each restaurant's menu to call in and order. The app fetches restaurant data from The Eat Street API and sets the user's location using The Google Maps Geolocation API.

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### Redux Architecture

* 3+: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amercado1014/Headcount-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a react app that allows users to view and compare various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. Users can scroll through visual cards representing the districts then click on up to two cards if they would like to compare data. Currently, HeadCount 2.0 only displays a single page that shows the percentage of kindergartners in a full day program. There are future plans to implement more pages utilizing more data such as enrollment, test scores, dropout rates, graduation rates, remediation, household incomes, and special education.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4-: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

This gear up was about microaggressions and how they can affect our daily lives. It was interesting to see that things that are said can be taken differently from person to person. It is important to understand and know that microaggressions exist and how to be aware of them.  

#### Groupthink

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)

Groupthink is the practice of thinking or making decisions as a group in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility. In this gear up we talk about how we can avoid groupthink and encourage participation so that we take advantage of the entire group. Some of the things we can do would be to assign one person to be a devils advocate or having leaders stay out of a group meeting to avoid influencing decisions.    

#### Mod 4 Lead: Fake News

* [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023)

During this gear up we talked about fake news and how it affects the world we live in. The internet and social media have made spreading fake news so much easier. It is crazy how many people just share things without even knowing where it is coming from. We need to do our part and check the source before sharing anything.
