##Maia Stone - M4 Portfolio

###Areas of Emphasis

Wow.  What a ride Turing.  My goals this mod were to graduate!!  It was a rough start to the mod, but grit won. I'm very proud of my accomplishments on the capstone. That was a great way to wrap things up. I really wanted to have a job by graduation, but found it quite challenging to find the time to do what's needed. Additionally, my confidence wasn't quite there and it's tough to sell yourself if you don't believe. I have a few conversations going, but look forward to my own personal mod 5 to get things in order and be focused on what's next for me. I enjoyed working solo most of the mod, and it gave me some insight into what I might be looking for in a working environment.  Even though I would have valued and learned from working with others, it really forced me to dig in and prove to myself that I can tackle these projects from beginning to end.

##B: Individual Work & Projects
 

###Capstone - Real Estate Dashboard

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/maiastone/real-estate-investment-management)   
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)
[Production Site](https://fierce-cove-58460.herokuapp.com/)   
In this phase of the project, heavy emphasis was placed on the design process, and creating a clean and clear user interface and experience.  I whiteboarded the initial wireframes, and then used sketch for a higher fidelity.  The user was consulted to determine the most important data and then again to determine if the visualization was effective and appropriate.  The MVP uses data from excel and runs it through Victor, a set of modular charting components for React.  Next steps would be to incorporate the Quickbooks and Airbnb API for pulling the property information.   

####Production
75: Application is deployed and in production.
####JavaScript Style
35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
####User Interface
40: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
####Risk Taking and Creativity
50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
####Testing
40: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
####Workflow
50: The developers effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches.
####Extensions
Developer went through an entire wireframe process with Lauren - user testing - etc
   
To get a 4 on this project, you need to achieve 300 / 325

####Final Score: 300 / 325  

###Refacktor Track
[Daily Markdown](https://gist.github.com/maiastone/7ac4fab442d0335fc9a040d33f2a9a88)     
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/refacktor-track.html)    
I worked on Real Time, my personal site, and my personal project. In addition, I pursued several opportunites on the job front, and spent time with my family. I enjoyed the process of documenting my work, my time, and my progress. It was great to decide what was important for me to accomplish and be able to manage myself to meet those goals.  

####Pass

###Assignments Assignment
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/maiastone/f147a3487008123326ef9fba5eac05d1)  
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/mod-4-assignments-assignment.html)  

I created a markdown file to track and show completed work over the mod.  It was a nice change of pace to work on some of these smaller assignments along with our regular projects.  Being more of a 'traditional' learner, I appreciated a different learning style.

##C: Group Work & Projects
###UI Design Comp Challenge  

**Feedback From Dylan Avery**  
Working with Maia was a great experience. She is a great communicator, and very easy-going. She has a great over-standing of CSS, and is good at envisioning something as it gets manifested on screen. She has laser like, rapid-fire focus, and avoids wasting any time. She is also great at brainstorming, and she is a well-spring of ideas. Maia has been a role model and mentor during my time here at Turing, and I thank her for helping us be better hustlers and programmers.  


##D: Professional Skills

###Gear Up

####Universal Basic Income 
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)   
I think we will always be faced with the challenges of creating new jobs, products, and services.  We may not know the 'next big thing' but I'm somewhat confident in our ability, or naturally evolving state, to figure out solutions as they are needed.  I definitely need to understand more facts and figures, rather than feelings, before forming a solid opinion on the subject.

####Automation
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)   
The discussion on automation was interesting and thought provoking, but I wish there had been more targeted or focused content, rather than a general conversation about whether we are doomed or not.  

####Tragedy of the Commons  
I was in an interview during this time.   


###Professional Development Workshops
I submitted all cold outreach emails and received confirmation from Meg.
  
My resume, LinkedIn, and Alumni portfolio sites are all submitted and approved.

I completed a technical interview with a company.    


##E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback

**To Dylan Avery**    
I had a great time working with Dylan for our design comp challenge.  Even though we'd never worked together, it was a smooth and easy process.  He's clear in his communication, has solid user experience design ideas, and is great with Sketch.  We worked really well pairing together, sharing ideas and implementation. If I had one suggestion, it would fall under time management, and to have worked on the final touches earlier. Overall, I really like his laid back but professional attitude and would work with him anytime. 


###Playing a Part

This mod I continued to lead the Turing Lab posse.  Even though I was unable to attend every time, due to job related pursuits, I still assisted with planning and organization.  My favorite activity was circuit bending - where we deconstructed old toys with musical components and made new circuits.
