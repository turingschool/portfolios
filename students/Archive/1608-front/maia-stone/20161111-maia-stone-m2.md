##Maia Stone - M2 Portfolio

**Areas of Emphasis**

This module I knew I needed to write more code!  I wanted to feel confident with JavaScript.  I didn't know how much we would focus on React, but I'm glad we got to go deeper with it, and that I had the time for individual learning to come out with a solid foundation and understanding. I put in 12-15 hours a day and worked both days of every weekend. I'm proud of my progress, and especially considering I'm balancing my family, running a nonprofit, and working for my husband's company.  I would never use this as an excuse, but I do recognize the time required to be successful in this program, and find it to be tougher than I anticipated.  If there were just a few more hours in the day, I could code a little more!! On another note, I wanted to go deep with Sass. I ended up doing the styling on every project, but I didn't get to take it to the level I hoped. I feel good about git and have been able to continuously improve my workflow with partners.  I was also thrilled to have the budgeting app project, and be able to implement my ideas and knowledge of finance.

##B: Individual Work & Projects


###Number Guesser in React

* [GitHub](https://github.com/maiastone/guess-my-number)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

For this project we rebuilt a mod 1 project in React.  I really enjoyed the chance to revist this project and the opportunity to work alone.

**Functional Expectations**    
3.5 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two   

**Fundamental JavaScript/React Style**   
3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


###Weathrly
* [Github](https://github.com/maiastone/weathrly) 
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)   

This weather app was our first project in React.  It was ungraded, so we were able to take the time to dig deep and understand the concepts.  We used hard-coded API-like data to create a user interface that reflected the weekly forecast, including pictures to represent the weather.   

  
**Feedback from Alex Pilewski**   
I very much enjoyed working with Maia on Weathrly. I thought we had a great mental approach to the project, it being an ungraded project definitely allowed us to take our time diving into tutorials that semi-inadvertently deepend our understanding for how webpack worked in addition to making our first React App a much less painful experience. I would love to work with Maia again in the future, if only to put a real API into the weather app for our portfolios!  

##C: Group Work & Projects

This module we focused heavily on React.     
Our new tech stack included: 
React, Sass, Webpack, Firebase, Enzyme, Selenium

###2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub](https://github.com/maiastone/2DoBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

This project took our mod 1 IdeaBox and pivoted it over to 2DoBox. We used webpack and were scored on user interface, accessibility, Sass and testing.  We used selenium for testing. 

**Specification Adherence**   
3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

**Accessibility**   
4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

**User Interface**   
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

**HTML Style**   
3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

**CSS/Sass Style**   
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

**JavaScript Style**   
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

**Testing**
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

**Workflow**   
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**Code Sanitation**   
3 - The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows… Five or fewer complaints

**Feedback from Matt Kaufman**     
I love having you around Maia! You keep the instructors true and on their toes by asking the questions that everyone is thinking but might not want to say. You are super valuable to our cohort as an active voice and also having really awesome knowledge outside programming. I really enjoy working with you and you have a really good heart - thank you for always being around and active in our community


###Shoot the Breeze

[Github](https://github.com/maiastone/chat-app)   
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)   

This was our first project with Firebase.  Requirements for the chat app included a filterable list of users contributing to the chatroom, an input and a message box that is also filterable.  We used React, Webpack, Firebase, and Enzyme. 

**Specification Adherence**   
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

**Component Architecture**   
3 - Application is broken in out into at least 8 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

**User Interface**   
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

**CSS/Sass Style**   
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

**JavaScript Style**

**Workflow**   
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**Code Sanitation**   
4 - The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows… - Zero complaints

**Design**   
4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

**Feedback from Kristen Burgess**   
It was such a pleasure working with you, Maia! You are a tenacious learner with such a strong work ethic. Neither of us were feeling particuarly confident with React when we started, and that definitely changed in the course of this project! Your dedication to really understanding these new tools we are working with was contagious, and it definitely contributed to my learning process. I feel like part of how/why we both learned so much was allowing ourselves to really individually dig in deep to some features. You did a great job of explaining things as you figured them out, something I'm really trying to improve on, and I think you provided a great example. I hope we get to work together again soon! 

###Fire-Bae

[GitHub](https://github.com/maiastone/budget-app)   
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

For this project our team chose to make a budgeting app for kids.  It allows for easy input of monthly budgeted expeneses.  Once the budgets are set - the user can go in an input actual expenses.  As a result, the user will see a graph on the home page showing how much money they have to spend for the month on each item.  A reports page shows weekly, monthy, and annual budgets, as well as allowing for an input of allowance, to be used as a tool to determine how much the user needs to receive or how much they need to cut expenses.
We used React, Firebase, Webpack, and Enzyme

**Specification Adherence**   
4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.

**Risk Taking and Creativity**   
3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

**Design**   
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

**User Interface**   
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

**HTML Style**   
4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

**CSS/Sass Style**   
4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

**JavaScript Style**   
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Input was broken, major refactoring. With time given and number of developer I think its a three. Developers understand what needed to be done but ran out of time.

**Testing**   
3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

**Workflow**   
2 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

**Accessibility**   
4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

**Code Sanitation**   
4 - The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows… Zero complaints

**Feedback from Nick Chambers**   
Maia and I took on the sizeable "Fire-Bae" project with one another, and we assembled a minimal viable product for a kids-oriented budgetting app. We spent a good amount of time pairing together, while also dividing and conquering on much of the work. We had a solid workflow throughout most of the project, and I was constantly impressed by Maia's work ethic. She goes all in, gets things done, and stays very oriented towards productivity and taking care of business. I really admire her commitment to learning the craft of coding while also doing the myriad other things she does with her time. I think she sometimes needs to trust that she knows what she's doing  and that she is a talented coder. There were a few times when she would get frustrated a little early on in the process of trying to debug a problem and ask for help or seek out a quicker solution. I think Maia could work on grinding through problems a bit more and trust in her abilities. Alas, we were but a team of two, and we had less man/woman hours than the other groups in our cohort. I appreciated Maia's eagerness to get shit done and learned a lot from working with her. She's a smart, fun partner and is going to be an awesome developer. 

##D: Professional Skills

##Gear Up

[**Vote Your Conscience**](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)   
I appreciate that Turing cares about us being responsiblity citizens and active members of our community.  It was nice to take a break from code, think about hte importance of our role as humans in the US, and get some perspective on the bigger picture.  

[**Introversion and Extroversion on Teams**](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)   
This was a great gear up.  Until this, I hadn't really considered how this affects teams.  Previously I had thought about this only as an individual issue. In the project immediately following this gear up, my partner and I agreed to take some time to be our introverted selves, and work apart from each other and alone.  It was great to work in the environment of my choice, and really dig into my code alone.  I also like that we have since established some loud and quiet areas during certain lessons.

[**Resilience**](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)   
From this gear up, I learned that I AM resilient and actually gained a ton of confidence.  I never really valued resilience as a skill - it was merely something I did for survival.  But now I can more consciously practice that self talk AND tie in an affirmation of this skill and use that affirmation to gain more resilience.

##Professional Development Workshops

This mod we worked on creating a company tracker and finding a person in each company to reach out and send a cold email.  I really enjoyed this process, digging into the companies, and meetup sites, to determine who I might make a connection with and where I might be a good fit. 

I created my board in Trello, and shared it with Meg.  I also had Meg review my resume, and had a session with mentor Ian Douglas, which was extremely helpful.  In this process, while I've been open to finding a job with a "great learning environment," I've also learned that it's harder to network and target companies if you don't have a focus.

Additionally, I enjoyed the session on Scrum and Agile practices.  I would like to be able to implement these more in our projects, but in the last project we used waffle, and referred to it regularly to determine our backlog and outstanding issues. 

##E: Feedback and Community Participation

##Giving Feedback

**Community Feedback to Lacey Knaff**  

Lacey, you are a positive and thoughtful person, with a sunny disposition.  I always look forward to talking with you and seeing what you are building.  Your design skills are fabulous, and I would encourage you (or ask you!) to share more of your tools, techniques, perspective and projects with everyone.  I think you add tremendous value to our mod and community, I hope we get to pair on a project sometime!  Thank you for taking time to chat with me about projects, life, or the future.

##Being a Community Member


**Playing a Part**   

I've had many people tell me they appreciate all the questions I ask in class.  I came to realize that most often, people have the same questions or comments, but are afraid or unwilling to ask. So, I do feel a responsbility to keep that up.  Additionally, while I don't want to be known or remembered for this - I made a TON of coffee this mod, and posted the instructions for brewing, so others wouldn't be afraid to try themselves.  It may seem trivial, but really, coffee is important.   

This mod I felt that I really needed to keep my head down and put in the hours to write more code.  I spent any additional minutes with my family and taking care of personal business.  As a result, I didn't make myself availabe for pairing, which makes me feel badly.

I did checkout Kids Who Code, and tried to conceptualize a way I could collaborate with my nonprofit, MindSpark, but couldn't really come up with anything.  Instead, it looks like I'll be leading a track inside a new hardware possee, focused on electronic textiles.  I'm super excited to share my knowledge and take it to the next level!

Notes

We are incredibly impressed by how much work, and the quality of work that you bring out. 

I would like to see you to struggle a little longer before you reach out for help. Really debug. If and when you reach out for help, you can tell someone exactly where it's at. - Taylor

Met with Ian, met with Meg.
