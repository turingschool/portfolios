##Maia Stone - M3 Portfolio

###Areas of Emphasis

This mod was extremely challenging for me.  More for personal reasons than for the content of the curriculum.  My family demands were draining on me mentally and physically, and I could not put in the time that I wanted to code.  Additionally, I did not get the sleep I needed to be a high functioning human.   

However, I feel I still managed to perform well and am proud of my work, and my ability to manage my life.  I wanted to build my knowledge of react, and I definitely did.  I wanted to work on a visually creative project, so I'm really glad we had the open opportunity to choose our own adventure.  I'm happy with the results and learned a lot about react and ux/design.      

I wanted to contribute more to the community this mod, and I did.  I started a posse, brought in a speaker, and helped a bunch of people in our cohort on projects, and personally.   I tried to remain a positive force and help motivate those around me.

##B: Individual Work & Projects

A clean and smooth photography website, built with React, React-Router, JavaScript, and Sass.   

###Self-Directed - Photography Website

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)   
I wanted to focus on a more visual and creative project, and found the opportunity to build this site photography website. Project goals included creating a beautiful and smooth responsive design to captivate the user and keep them on the site. The photographer client wanted a site to showcase his work, and get new clients for either fine art or commercial work. He wanted lots of big images, little text, filtering capability, and plenty of whitespace.

##C: Group Work & Projects

This mod we had two group projects, Weather-Tracker and remEMBER.  These were both using tools that were new for us, Redux and Ember.  We also worked with a group of 4 for the first time, which was an interesting dynamic.  For remEMBER, we also used a new git workflow, which I found extremely valuable.   

###Weather-Tracker

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/maiastone/weather-tracker)     

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)   

A react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.

**From Kinan Whyte**   
Working with Maia on our first project was great. We had not worked together before, so it was nice to finally work together. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Overall, Maia did a great job with taking ownership over all of the testing in React. She had not focused on that much before, so the goal that she set out for this project surely was met. If she could improve on anything it might be rounding out to other corners of the project despite wanting to learn testing. She might have explained more about how she went about the testing process and shared more of her learning, but we were all hard-pressed with time to be able to share so much as well. Working with 4 people also made this less possible. I would be happy to work with Maia in the future.

**From Ian Lancaster**   
I really enjoyed working with Maia on the weather tracker app. Maia is one of the hardest working individuals I have been partnered with, and it is obvious to me how that perseverance is making her a very capable developer. I thought that Maia was a great pairing partner when we worked on tests together and I would gladly work with her again.

sorry Maia I really don’t have any critical feedback for you.   

###remEMBER

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/maiastone/1608-remember-5)   
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)   

A notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality.
Project success was based primarily on pull-request quality, and secondarily on the level of project completion.

##D: Professional Skills

###Gear Up
####Microagresssions
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)   
This session confronted me with the issue and how it comes into play in daily life, and that I might be witness to, not just in the few instances I've experienced.  How I deal with this as it occurs depends on the timing and other people around.  I have sometimes confronted people for their ignorant comments.  Sometimes it seems like it clicks with the person and sometimes not.  So, it depends on how much time and energy I have at the moment to deal with the aggressor.   
####Grit
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)   
It was interesting to think about grit while pushing through this program and instead of refering to the sacrifices my family is making to have me here, I can turn that into a positive attribute, that my husband and I both have grit, because we feel strongly that this is the right direction for all of us.   I also enjoyed thinking about it in terms of what more specifically in this line of work will allow me to draw from that grit.   
####Journey Mapping
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)   
The journey mapping exercise definitely helped me think about the user experience, and how to break that into small pieces and steps.  I felt the session was poorly executed, but I appreciate the exercise and will use this in my future development.

##E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback

**To Joey Stansfield**    
It was great getting to know you and work with you through the Turing Lab.   I appreciate that we communicated smoothly and effectively, but most of all stayed on the same page.  I think it’s hard to measure success through the concept and practice of making.  But what I hope to inspire is that curiosity and exploration.  I look forward to developing this further next mod, and shaping the future of the Turing Lab.  Now let's figure out who wants to take over, so it lives on!


**To Jeff Duke**   
Jeff, I'm going to miss having you around the school and the posse.  You are a pleasure to work with, and I love how you calmly and quietly, but vigriously teach your peers on a diverse set of skills.  Thanks for including me with the leadership team and geting this thing rolling.  I look forward to the progress of the Turing Lab.  Stay in touch!

###Being a Community Member

**From Joey Stansfied**  
Hey Maia, thanks for being a part of the Turing Lab this module. Having you and Jeff contributing really made that a good experience for me. I stressed out a few times thinking we had to provide high quality content every single week. I think you had a more relaxed idea from the very beginning and you’re idea of a “shared space to do self directed work around making” is really what the posse became. So thanks for being a part of that. I’m excited to see the future of the Turing Lab. Justin Gitlin was really awesome by the way.   

**From Jeff Duke**
Maia, thanks so much for helping make the Turing Lab a big success!  It was great to have your enthusiasm and drive for seeing the posse become a reality.  I'm glad to know that you and Joey will be around for another mod to keep things going and I hope you are able to find a couple folks to take over for you.  I'd love to see the lab continue on and be a long-running posse at Turing.  Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help!  Good luck with Mod-4 and your career after Turing!   

###Playing a Part

This mod I not only helped to start a new posse, and teach some interested students about electronic textiles, but I also had my mentor come speak at a Friday spike.  In the last week, I also had several students thank me for helping them and saving them lots of time.  That definitely felt great.
