# Lacey Knaff - M4 Portfolio

##Summary
Mod4 was all about the job hunt. I set out to get a job offer before the end of the module, so spent a lot of my time networking, sending cold outreach emails, prepping for interviews, and applying for jobs. It was definitely overwhelming having to try to balance both school and the job search, but I successfully completed both and was able to secure a job that I think will be really great for my growth as a designer and developer.

##Areas of Emphasis
* Getting a job offer
* Learning how to set up a backend database
* Learning to make applications that use express and node
* Using Heroku for deployment

#####Description:
The Refactor Track was a week long project where we were allowed to do self-directed work. Each day we had a group stand up and were in charge of tracking hours and keeping on track.

## D: Professional Skills
####I completed all needed professional skills requirements for the Module.
1. Branden Youngs of TechGrayscale. He emailed be back and said that he was working overseas remotely now but gave me the contact information for a coworker. I emailed the coworker but did not hear back.

2. Cortland Coffey of Denver Outfitters. Met with them at their space and discussed their needs. I didn't think I was a good fit but created a connection between Cortland and Lia for future opportunities.

3. Scott MacDonald of Lumenati and Cinebody. He connected me with the owner of Barbershop, who I emailed but did not hear back from.

4. Corban of Barbershop. Did not hear back.

5. Juan Ponce of Red Van Workshop. Met for coffee, shared his contact with Chelsea.

6. Kate Catlin of Flock. I discussed a few opportunities with her, but did not find something that I felt would be a good fit. We discussed the type of jobs I was looking for and she is keeping me in mind for future opportunities she might come across.

### Gear Up

####Tragedy of the Commons
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really enjoyed the visual aspect of learning in this gear up. I also had a great conversation with my group about the systemic bias that's engrained in our society and how we can make small changes to address it.

####Automation
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This was kind of a scary Gear Up. I mean, I knew that automation was thing but didn't realize how far reaching it is and how much it's expected to take over in the future. We had a great discussion around how we can prepare for that future.

####Universal Basic Income
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I enjoyed this gear up discussion. I've never really heard of the idea of UBI, so it was interesting to read and talk about with other students. We came away pretty much as unsure of the future as when we went in.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback:
This was my first time working with Hilary on a project and I was really blown away by her project management skills. She has a unique ability to break down larger tasks into, smaller, more manageable pieces an divvy out those tasks accordingly so that things stay on track. She conistently checks in with her teammates to get a pulse on how things are going with the group and makes suggestions and changes to the workflow accordingly. If I could suggest one thing for her to work on, and this is something I also need to work on, is being more consistent with her use of es6 (using const or let vs. var, destructuring, etc). Otherwise, she's an extremely hard working and quick learning developer who I think is going to go on to be a great asset to any team. --To Hilary Lewis


This was my third time working with Nick over the course of my time at Turing and it's been really great to see his growth throughout the program. I've always been really impressed with his ability and desire to tackle difficult problems and this last project that was particulary evident as he took on a lot of the complex backend logic. I didn't work super closely with Nick during this project, so it was hard for me to take a critical look at areas of improvement, but I think from the outside looking in, he could work on trying to take a step back, especially when he's just spinning his wheels on a problem. Maybe it would be helpful to start working on a different piece of the project to give himself some space from the problem, and then come back to the problem later. Either way, his work ethic and desire to learn are going to be great assets to any development team. --To Nick Chambers

Working with Ryan is always a great experience, and the capstone project was no exception. His growth as a teammate has been extremely evident over the course of time at Turing. He's always been a really hard-worker, but has grown into being a really great team player. He's always willing to hear out other's ideas, is humble with sharing his own ideas, and is consistently stepping back to take a look at the bigger picture. Overall Ryan is going to be a phenomenal leader and part of a development team, and any of the companies giving him offers are going to be really lucky to have him. One piece of advice I have for Ryan is that he can be a humble person but also own how awesome he is. I think he'll go a really long ways with more confidence in who he is and what he brings to the table. I can't wait to see what's next for Ryan, and I hope he keeps me in mind when he starts his fortune 500 company. $$ --To Ryan Westlake

Noah is a self-motivated developer who's not afraid to ask for feedback and advice, which are great soft skills to take into the workplace. I had a couple of opportunities to work with Noah on his personal portfolio, and every time I was impressed with his ability to accept critical advice and desire to learn from others. Not only is this an impressive way to approach work and life, but Noah is just a really pleasant person to talk and work with. One piece of advice I have for him would be to go after learning more about design if he thinks it's something he's really interested in. I think every one can gain an eye and ability to design with the correct amount of time and effort. Either way, he's going to be a great addition to any team or company he decides to work with. --To Noah Peden (Mod3)

Lauren, Lucy and Dylan did a phenomenal job taking over and leading the Verou Posse. The sessions were always welcoming to newcomers, well thought out, and just a joy to be a part of. I know first hand how hard it is to find time at Turing to lead and run a posse, so stepping up to take on the challenge of taking over leading the posse was a great accomplishment for all of them, and I'm really glad they were all willing to volunteer their time to keep to posse alive. I've really enjoyed getting to know all of you the past 3 mods! Finish strong! --To the Verou Posse leaders

###Being a Community Member:
I am so happy I got the opportunity to work with Lacey on this project. I regret not getting to work with her more throughout my time at Turing because our collaboration with each other allows me to learn a lot from Lacey. Lacey has so much to offer a team because of her eye for design, deep understanding of UX/UI, efficiency in writing JavaScript, clean and consistant css implementations, and encouraging personality. If there is one thing I can offer to Lacey, it would be to have confidence in the ideas she has to bring to a project, expecially when working with people who may have a 'bigger title'. I say this because her ideas for not only design but also javascript are very valuable and powerful. Overall, I hope in the future I can to work with Lacey again and Cultivator has won a very impressive designer and developer. --From Hilary Lewis

I've worked with Lacy on three projects, and she owns big time. She is a silent slayer, and Cultivator is very lucky to have her on board. I'd encourage her to keep pushing herself after Turing and to embrace leadership roles because she's very good at what she does. --From Nick Chambers

Once again, it was great to work with Lacey! She is wellrounded, listens well, knows how to make suggestions, and is fun to be around. I honestly don't have any constructive feedback. Can't wait to see where her career takes her! --From Ryan Westlake

Lacey's eye and mind for design and clean code is one of the reasons I asked to pair with her this mod on my personal site. She was honest and helpful with the ideas I came up with for my own site, and helped walk me through what could be some challenges or downfalls. I think she's probably one of those developers who's going to end up getting paid buttloads cause she's basically a UX Designer with the skill set of an experienced Front End Engineer. Overall she was a pleasure to work with. -- From Noah Peden

###Playing a Part

###Goals
My goals for after graduation are:
* continue my education in front-end development
