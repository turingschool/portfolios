# Lacey Knaff - M3 Portfolio

## Summary
I had a lot of big plans for Mod3. Although I didn't accomplish a lot of my goals that I made at the end of last Mod, I shifted my emphasis to becoming stronger with vanilla javascript and pushed myself to do some more reading and research in topics outside of school. This helped a lot with my confidence in the skills I'm learning and I found that by the end of Mod3 I was feeling much stronger in my coding abilities.

For Mod4, I'm really looking forward to working more on networking and beginning the job search and hopefully accomplish a lot of the goals that I made for myself in Mod3 but didn't have time to accomplish. One main thing I'd like to start doing next Mod is taking better care of myself. Not being active is really starting to wear on me, so I'd like to make a really conscience effort to be more active and healthy. I'd also like to start attending more social events, and start getting some solid leads on the job search.

## Areas of Emphasis

* Volunteer at another GDI event.
* I would like to utilize my mentor more often, as well as reach out to a mentor in the Denver area.
* Work on using keyboard shortcuts!
* Take more time to focus on my health.
* Start looking for job opportunities and putting myself out there.
* Continue working on my portfolio and personal brand
* Spend a couple hours on extra curricular work or reading that's focused on business, design or a combination of the two.
* Put more focus on the Lea Verou Posse. Making sure the sessions are effective and useful for the people there.

#####Feedback to me from Graham Nessler, Nick Chambers, and Ryan Westlake

This was my second opportunity to work with Lacey. Her insights into React and Redux consistently enhanced our project, and she saved the day on more than one occasion when Nick and I had dug ourselves into a styling hole. Like me, she has a quiet style, and I think we both could benefit from speaking up more at times. Nonetheless, Lacey is an excellent teammate, and I hope that we work together again in the future. --Graham

This was the second time I'd worked with Lacey, and I was so impressed to see how much knowledge she's gained. Her skillset has really grown over the past two modules, and she's one of the most well-rounded Turing students I've worked with. She gets a lot of credit for her design and styling skills (which seem to me to be way beyond the level of junior developer), but she also pairs that with a very strong understanding of Javascript/React and a get-shit-done approach to problem solving. One of the things I noticed the first time I worked with her was that she is quite good at doing online research to figure out problems, and she's definitely gotten even better. I think Lacey should challenge herself to step into more leadership roles. She has such a strong skillset and solid attitude, and I think she'd make a great project lead. I would absolutely love to work with Lacey again. --Nick

I was excited when I saw that I would be one of Lacey's partners for the weather project. Over the past two mods, I had noticed how hard she works, as well as her development and design talent. The project went really well. She is awesome to work with. We did a lot of the Redux/main functionality together. Not only did she have great ideas, but was also simply a joy to spend time with. I believe she will go far, whether that's playing an integral part of a dev team or running her own agency. My one constructive feedback also applies to me â€” not getting concerned or flustered when you hit a bug or difficult challenge. The best thing to do when a group hits a challenging spot is to relax and break it into the smallest piece. Overall, Lacey is terrific and I would be excited to work with her again. --Ryan


#####Feedback from me to Graham Nessler, Nick Chambers, and Ryan Westlake

Ryan is a phenomenal addition to any team. I think he has a great grasp on React, React Router and Redux so I was really excited to get the opportunity to work with, and learn from him on our Weathrly project. I was really impressed with his willingness to not only slow down and explain concepts, but his humbleness to ask questions about things he didn't know and ability to take feedback and ideas. I agree with his critique, for both of us, to not get flustered over problems that don't get solved right away and to take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and begin to break things down into small feasible chunks.  Overall, he's a great team player and I would love to work with him again.

It was great to be able to work with Graham again and see how far he's progressed since Mod1. As always, he was a pleasure to work with. He communicated his ideas effectively, had an unparalled workflow, and has a sincere desire to work on his weaknesses. In this particular project he chose to put a little more focus on Sass and HTML. I think Graham has a slight tendency to overcomplicate things, but I think that's something that will be improved over time as Graham continues on with development.

Nick brings a certain positivety to groups, which is really great, especially during stressful times. Going into this project he expressed interest in taking on his areas of weakness which were styling and css and I was really impressed by his and Graham's initiative to take that on. They both did a great job focusing on something they hadn't had much practice on. I think initially he was feeling a little bit fuzzy on Redux concept, as we all were, but really starting getting a grasp on it by the end. Overall, just really impressed with his curiosity and passion to take on all aspects of the project.

### Gear Up

#### MicroAggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

This session was really eye opening in a lot of ways. Especially so, because I didn't really have a firm grasp on what micro-aggessions were and this was really enlightening to be able to talk about with others

#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This was a great segway from the gear up on resilience. It reminded me of how much grit it took to get to this point and that I need to continue with the same passion and perserverance even when the going gets tough.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback
Laszlo's genuine kidness is really hard to come by, Chelsea and I felt incredibly lucky to have him as a part of the Verou posse and to get to know him as a person. He is always willing to lend a helping hand and step up when needed to share his knowledge and perspective. When Chelsea and I asked for people to volunteer to give spikes during posse time Laszlo volunteered without hesitation. Not only are we happy to have had Laszlo as a part of the Verou Posse, but we look forward to continuing to get to know him as a developer and friend!

###Being a Community Member
Another module with the Verou Posse being under Chelsea's and Lacey's leadership. I enjoyed very much joining the weekly sessions. They provided great energy to bring together a large group to spread knowledge about front end related concepts and tools. Joining the Verou Posse from the Back End program the atmosphere was always welcoming and never for a second felt as an "outsider". They proved that they have what it takes to bring people together for collaboration. As they move to Mod4 and hand over leadership of the Verou Posse, their effort and contribution will be missed. Laszlo Balogh

Great job running the posse for another mod! It's been a great part of the Turing community, and filled a real gap.

Chelsea and Lacey are an incredible team. I always love participating in the Verou posse and I truly think they have done a great job with organizing and leading the group. They are always positive, hard working, and approachable. Thanks for putting together an amazing posse you two!

### Playing a Part

* I attended morning coffee with the Joane Clarke Society on Tuesdays and intend on continuing to attend when I can. I enjoy getting to know ladies from other modules and feeling like I have a support group of women.
* I continued to co-lead the Lea Verou Posse, a posse focused on design and development. I lead several sessions here an worked on my public speaking skills.
* Attended Friday morning talks, Friday gear ups and lunch roulettes. I really enjoyed all of our gear up events and liked being involved in our break out discussions.
* I made an effort to reach out, and meet up for coffee with a mentor and role-model of mine.

###Goals

For mod3
* Create work-back schedule for job hunt
* Set clear weekly goals for applications, technical interview prep, and networking
* Focus on being more active
* Finish my portfolio over intermission week
