# Lacey Knaff - M2 Portfolio

## Summary
This Mod I set out to work on my public speaking skills, become more adept in JavaScript and become a more confident developer. I feel like I achieved all of those goals, and though I know I have a long way to go, I'm happy with the progress I've made. I took several steps towards working on public speaking by starting and co-leading a design posse and leading several sessions there. I also worked really hard on my skills in Sass, JavaScript and React and found a deep passion for the 3. I think my confidence in development is a work in progress, but it was super helpful to have some time to work on personal projects to prove to myself that I could problem-solve on my own.

In Mod3 I really hope to take more time for my health, be more diligent about learning outside of school, and continue to practice public speaking and teaching. I often found it difficult to share my knowledge with other, on design etc, do to a lack of confidence so I'd really like to focus on letting go of not being perfect and believing that others can gain value from what I have to contribute.

Due: 2016-11-08

MoMoney was a pivot off of the idea of a financial application for our final project. It takes in a set of values from a user about a job offer (salary offer, yearly bonus, perks, miles from work, and location) and gives an adjusted annual, monthly, weekly and hourly pay scale based on various calculations. The application takes in cost of living from all 50 states and displays a random quote on the login screen. We build this application using React and stored user details and input using Firebase.

#####Feedback to me from Ian Lancaster and Dale Hendrickson

Lacy was a great partner to work with our module final project. I was looking forward to working with her because of the awesome design expertise she brings to all projects, and I was not disappointed. Lacy was great at collaborating during the planning of the app and while writing the code. I appreciated her assertiveness when she had an opinion to convey and her ability to also effectively compromise. I felt that Lacy had a solid understanding of every aspect of the application including the react code, testing, and design. Lacy did a particularly good job with the Sass for this project. One area that I think Lacy could work on would be overviewing and explaining the work that she does on her own. There was a lot of really cool Sass and design incorporated into this project, and it would have been great if she took a little bit of time at the beginning of group time every day to explain and go over the changes she made.

I worked with Lacey and Ian on the Fire-Bae project. Lacey was great to work with on the project and brought amazing css and design skills that were well received during the review. We found a good balance of individual and team work time and were able to problem solve effectively. An area of strengthening may be more verbal communication when she is working through a problem in pairing sessions. I really enjoyed learning about object oriented CSS from Lacey. I look forward to working with her in Mod3.


#####Feedback from me to Ian Lancaster and Dale Hendrickson

It was  a pleasure to finally work with Ian on a project. I felt as though he brought a great breadth of knowledge to our team when it came to React and testing, and was willing to share his thoughts and opinions on how best to structure our project, and write well compartmentalized code. Some areas of improvement for Ian would be to work on his communication with team members and to be open to listening and trying out ideas from others in the group. Overall, I learned a lot from working with Ian, and his competency and efficiency in problem-solving is very evident!

I had a fantastic time working with Dale on our group project, MoMoney. He is an incredibly efficient planner and manager. Throughout the project he made sure to facilitate checkins with the group, utilized waffle effectively, and shared his skills in Agile work methods. I learned a lot from his leadership in the project. Some things Dale could work on are confidence in his abilities as a developer, I think he knows more than he gives himself credit for and I sometimes think it makes him question himself when he doesn't need to.  I also appreciated his feeback in our final review about focusing on areas of weakness in projects. I hope that we can work together on future projects to have the opportunity to share more of our strengths, as I think we could learn a lot from each other. Thanks Dale!

#####Feedback to me from Matt Kaufman and Andrew Crist

It was fantastic working with Lacey on Shoot the Breeze. She has a calm approach that is very productive, including times when facing specifically stressful problems. Shoot the Breeze was a challenge of logic and required us to write code in a new language and Lacey met it head-on. If something wasn’t clear to Lacey, or if she detected it might not be clear to me, she readily stopped coding to ensure understanding of the process. When it comes to testing and styling, Lacey is unmatched in my opinion. She is a patient teacher and really values the collective knowledge and learning of the group. If I’m forced to give Lacey constructive criticism, it would revolve around her confidence when she feels she has a solution to a problem, but doesn’t speak up. I noticed this hesitance only a couple of times and don’t think it hurt our progress, but I am aware of my own value of Lacey’s opinions and readily welcome any direction she might provide to a project.

Lacey was awesome to work with for shoot the breeze. It's not necessary to state, but she's the master of design. Even though we didn't have to actually design the project ourselves, she helped me learn some awesome css tricks and tips that I didn't know before. Lacey is a hard worker, an extremely reliable team member and just generally a pleasure to be around. I hope we can work on more projects together down the road, she is a super valuable asset to any team!


#####Feedback from me to Matt Kaufman and Andrew Crist

I really enjoyed working with Matt on our Shoot the Breeze project. He made it clear in the beginning of the project that he wanted to personally work on letting go of the reigns on a project and really empower the other people in the group to contribute and at the very least, take over all of the typing. I think he was really successful in this, and made great strides in personal growth during this project. Some areas of improvement for Matt would be to simplify. I think he is incredibly smart, and the next step for him in his path is a developer is to perform the complex tasks he can do in a more simplified way. Overall though, my favorite part of working with Matt is his optimism and his desire to see every one in the group succeed. Thanks, Matt!

Andrew was a great partner for Shoot the Breeze. He brought a great dynamic to the group, and his positivity and humor really kept the group going when we felt like giving up. He's also a very adept developer, and I appreciated his ability to take a step back and ask questions if he didn't fully understand something, and his desire to learn and try all aspects of the project. I think one area for improvement for Andrew would be confidence. I think he has a lot of talent that he doesn't give himself credit for. Overall, he was a fantastic contributor to the team and I look forward to working with him again in the future!

#####Feedback to me from Kristen Burgess

I had heard positive reviews from cohortmates on Lacey as a partner, and I was so excited to be paired together for 2DoBox! Her repuation did not falsley precede her! Lacey has a great attitude, and she approaches difficult problems with a calm, positive demeanor that is really pleasant to work with. She is well organized, a strong communcicator, and a hard worker. I think she writes very clean, logical code, and I felt like we paired together very well. Furthermore, in spite of all her modesty, she is so incredibly talented with creating beautifully designed layouts through exceptionally well written CSS! My only critique- and it's hardly a critique- is to be more confident! I feel like there are times you doubt yourself more than you should; you have no reason to with as talented as you are! I look forward to working together again in the modules ahead!


#####Feedback from me to Kristen Burgess

I really enjoyed working with Kristen on 2DoBox. She is a super hard worker, and I was really impressed with her drive to   delve into testing. Even though unit testing in Selenium wasn't very much fun, It was great to see her find something she was passionate about learning, and then continue on to be a kickass enzyme tester. I think we had a great group dynamic and I'd love to work with her again in the future!


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Vote your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This session was incredibly valuable for students at Turing. It's easy to forget our duties as citizens of this great country, and I often need a reminder myself. It got me more interested in the upcoming election and realizing that my vote does actually matter.

#### Introversion/Extroversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

Being and introvert, this Gear Up really hit home for me. It was great to see the unity of minds in our cohort over how best to accommodate for introverts at Turing. I also really appreciated the teachers implementation of approaching more activities in a self-learner style.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I took a lot away from this session. I feel like I've always practiced resilience, but often need a reminder and vocabulary attached to it. I had a really valuable talk with my group and at retro with my cohort about it as well.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback
Lucy has one of the most dynamic, go-getter personalities we've had the pleasure to meet at Turing. We felt incredibly lucky to have her as a part of the Lea Verou Posse. She volunteered to lead sessions, always showed up ready to learn something new, was willing to share her skill-set with the rest of the group, and even came up with a killer proposal to do a Design Hackathon. Overall, we were both super impressed with  not only her attitude, but her desire to be a part of the Turing community. We look forward to getting to know Lucy more, and seeing all the great things she does here at Turing and in life!

When starting the Verou Posse, we joked that Kristen would be our "community liaison". But it was no joke. From bringing cookies to a posse meeting to volunteering to lead presentations, Kristen has been a great posse member and community participant. She also asks great questions during posse presentations and always has a positive and cheerful attitude. We are so happy that she joined our posse!

###Being a Community Member
Lacey and Chelsea, great job with the Verou posse! You really stepped up and created something that has attracted great interest in the Turing community. I've really enjoyed being a part of this posse, and I look forward to our activities in the future. Kudos! -Graham Nessler

Lacey, you are a positive and thoughtful person, with a sunny disposition.  I always look forward to talking with you and seeing what you are building.  Your design skills are fabulous, and I would encourage you (or ask you!) to share more of your tools, techniques, perspective and projects with everyone.  I think you add tremendous value to our mod and community, I hope we get to pair on a project sometime!  Thank you for taking time to chat with me about projects, life, or the future. -Maia Stone

Both Chelsea and Lacey bring special energy to the Verou Posse that makes it special. The topics selected on a weekly basis are very interesting, they both do an excellent job to manage the flow of the meeting to make sure the presentation is completed, all questions are answered and still finished within the allocated time. I very much appreciate their effort and Verou Posse will be at the top of my list next Mod. Thank you. -Lazlo Balogh


### Playing a Part

* I attended morning coffee with the Joane Clarke Society on Tuesdays and intend on continuing to attend when I can. I enjoy getting to know ladies from other modules and feeling like I have a support group of women.
* I co-lead and co-founded the Lea Verou Posse, a posse focused on design and development. I lead several sessions here an worked on my public speaking skills.
