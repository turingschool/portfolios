# Christine Gamble - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I want to continue to build a strong foundation for JS and React. I plan to continue to do different exercises over intermission week and throughout module 4 to strengthen those skills. I also plan to work on cleaning up my resume and personal website and building connections to help with the job search.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were two group projects this module: Weather Forecast and remEMBER.

#### Weather Forecast

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrewLcrist/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

In this project you’ll be building a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.


##### Evaluation scores:
- Specification Adherence - 4
- Redux Architecture - 4
- Routing - 4
- JavaScript Style - 3
- Testing - 2
- Workflow - 3
- Troubleshooting - 4

##### Peer feedback:

From Andrew: I worked with Christine on Weather Forecast. She is a fantastic collaborative team member. She is a great listener and will reiterate ideas to show that she is listening. She is also able to provide actionable ideas, especially in moments that the rest of the team seems stuck. These qualities make working on a team with her stress-free. If I move on to Mod4 I hope we get to work together again.


#### remEMBER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/1608-remember-7)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

Create a notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality.

Developers will not have commit rights to the master branch. All changes must be made through pull requests that will be reviewed by instructors and merged into master when approved.

#### Evaluation comments:


##### Evaluation scores:

Closed all 10 Github issues.

##### Peer feedback:

From Nick: I found Christine to be a super trustworthy, knowledgeable, and efficient partner. We worked on the remEmber project together, and she was clear with communication and able to take care of business during every stage of the work. We traded off on handling each issue during the project, and our workflow felt stress-free and dialed in. We spent some time pairing together, but also worked individually on several segments. My one selfish wish would be that I could've collaborated more with Christine and learned from her. I did appreciate how she prioritizes a healthy work/life balance and seems to do a fine job of mitigating stress and burnout. It seems like she does really good work by herself, so perhaps I would encourage her to embrace collaboration more. I'd be excited to work with her again and think she's a kickass developer.


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

I went to the Microaggressions 101 session. I have been aware of the term and what it means, but I think it is always helpful to get more concrete examples and have conversations with other people about how they define it. The session was an important reminder of how common microagressions are and how they can easily be overlooked. It was an important discussion, and I think a follow-up session to discuss how to better address microagressions would be helpful.

#### Grit

* [Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I appreciated this session because it allowed me to define grit in a new way. I've typically defined it as perseverance, but passion is a huge piece of grit too. It can be easy to get burned out at Turing (and life after Turing), so it is important to figure out how to develop grit, when to apply it, and when it is okay to take a step back. I think I have learned that some with my time at Turing. I started here almost a year ago, have already been through 6 modules, but also realized I needed to take some time off for my health.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- Chelsea: Chelsea continually contributes to the Turing community. She created and has led the Verou posse, which is great for both front-end and back-end students. I know leading a posse can be very time consuming, and she and Lacey have gone out of their way to make sure this posse is worthwhile for those who attend. We unfortunately did not have any projects together this mod, but we still collaborated and problem solved together often, which I really appreciated. Chelsea is becoming a great developer and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

- Nick and I worked together on remEMBER. We mainly split up the work, but also collaborated some. I was very impressed with his problem solving abilities and determination to get the work done. I appreciated his flexibility and positivity throughout the project. Nick is a great developer and I look forward to working with him more in the future!

- I worked with Andrew on the weather forecast project. There was some initial animosity. Andrew mocked the way I pronounce “button”, “mountain”, and other words with “t”. I think he is still bitter that the Cubs won the World Series. Seriously though, Andrew is a really hard worker and a great developer, and this was helpful for our project. One thing I’ve noticed about Andrew is whenever I’m stuck on something and ask for help in Slack or in class, he is one of the first to offer help, and that is a quality that will take him far.


### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part
- I am a member of the Verou posse. I have been a part of the Pahlka posse for a long time, but decided it was time to try something different. It was really great to have a posse that was more front-end focused. I have some experience with data visualization, but design is new to me, so this was a great posse to be a part of and learn from!
