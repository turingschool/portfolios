## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Feedback
#### Giving Feedback
- To Mike Ziccardi: Mike was a great partner for the UX challenge. He had a great attitude throughout the project, and had good problem solving skills as we figured out how to use sketch. I appreciated his flexibility in changing his schedule and finding times to work on the project. I know Mike will continue to be a great developer.

- To Casey, Katy, and Charlotte: Our backend team! We’ve been so impressed with your willingness and enthusiasm to jump into the One Nation Many Voices project. You each provided valuable perspectives to the planning phase, and the API you created was really helpful in building out the MVP. We know you are going to be successful developers with your work ethic and problem solving abilities, and we hope you’ll continue working on this project!

- To Chelsea: It was so great to work on another project with Chelsea! I really appreciate that this project started before the capstone and it was in response to a true need we saw. We were able to work together and collaborate with others to decide how to handle the different challenges and determine what the MVP should be. Chelsea worked incredibly hard throughout the project, and I especially appreciate her UI/UX skills. In the future, she could work on being more decisive. While it is good to be flexible, we went back and forth a lot at the beginning trying to decide what the project for the capstone should be, what framework we should use, etc. Chelsea is a great developer, and I'm excited to see where she ends up.

#### Receiving Feedback
- From Mike: Working with Christine on the ux challenge was delightful. Other than it being assigned at the worst possible time ever, Christine was able to keep a positive attitude through it. She was super helpful in dealing with me as I refuse to purchase sketch she was willing to let us use her computer to work on the project. Being assigned in the last week she was able to manage her time well and would meet up with me to work whenever possible. Christine was a great partner and i'm going to miss her when she graduates.

- From Casey(back-end team): Christine & Chelsea, thank you so much for your initial ideation on this project, it really spoke to me and I was excited to contribute even if it required me learning skills beyond what we had covered at Turing. Your positivity and faith in Katy, Charlotte and I is what enabled this venture to be a success. I really enjoyed working with you and can't wait to see what you both achieve in your careers as developers. You have both inspired me to view software development as an opportunity to engage in civic activism through coding. 

- From Chelsea: It was fun working on the capstone with Christine. I love that we got to go through multiple steps of developing an application from developing/brainstorming an idea, creating a story boards, creating issues, and coding the MVP. Christine implemented an impressive workflow from creating issues, closing issues with PRs, and commenting on PRs. She is dependable and a great problem solver. She took on parts of the project and worked on them to address bugs and create solutions even when stumped. As far as ways to improve and grow, I think she could work on her agile workflow and doing more testing as she codes. 

### Being a Community Member
I co-led two spike sessions and worked with a team of mod2 back-end students. I hope to continue working with these students over the next couple of months.
