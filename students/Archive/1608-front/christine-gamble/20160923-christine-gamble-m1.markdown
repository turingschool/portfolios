# Christine Gamble - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I am really excited to be a part of the front-end program. I've been around at Turing for a little while, but so far this is a much better fit for me. I hope to continue my success in this program. My health is something that has impacted me in the past at Turing, and I am hoping I can find ways to move forward and be successful in the front-end program despite these issues.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There were two individual projects this module. Color changer was a one night project. The personal portfolio was assigned during the first week and is something we will work on throughout our time at Turing.

#### Personal Portfolio Site

* [Project Site](https://ccgamble.github.io/personal-portfolio/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

The portfolio site is an opportunity to make a first impression, and share your personality, skills, projects, resume, and contact information in one place.


#### Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/color-changer)
* [Project Site](https://ccgamble.github.io/color-changer/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

Color changer was a one night solo project. The goal was to create a site that had a default background color of white. One button on the page randomly set the background to a different color. The other button reset it back to white.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were four group projects this module: Number guesser, Ideabox, linked-list, and game time.

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/2048)
* [Project Link](https://rcwestlake.github.io/2048/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project involved building a game that is playable in the browser. The goals were to use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code, separate business-logic code from view-related code, and use test-driven design to build a client-side application.

##### Evaluation comments:
- be comfortable breaking logic into other classes or functions
- keep writing tests.
- group feels comfortable looping through things. Would love to see them move into using more map functions
- Saw really great instances of good practices. Would love to see more SRP functions

##### Evaluation scores:
- Functional Expectations - 3
- User Interface - 4
- Testing - 4
- Javascript Style - 3
- Workflow - 4
- Code Sanitation - 3

From Dale: Christine was on the Game Time project with Ryan and me.  She was a pleasure to work with and, as a team, worked really well together.  We received very positive feedback during the code review on the tests that were developed for the project.  Christine was lead for testing on the project and guided us to success.  I look forward to working with her in the future.

From Ryan: I had the pleasure of working with Christine for the Gametime project. From the beginning, she was collaborative, kind, and worked very hard. We accomplished many things over the course of a week and a half, including two 8+ hours bugs, and ended up with a product we can be proud of. Throughout the project, she remained calm wrote some amazing tests. She has a strong grasp on how to think with a “code” mindset, and is able to communicate it in a simple way.  I trust she will be very successful in the remainder of the program and beyond.


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/ideabox)
* [Project Link](https://ccgamble.github.io/ideabox/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

The goal of this project was to build a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas. Once ideas are generated, the user will be able to delete them or increase and decrease their quality. This project focuses on using a fluid and responsive client-side interface, JS and jQuery for filtering, and localStorage so the ideas persist between sessions.

#### Evaluation comments:
* really good job, well done
* missed meta viewport tag in head so doesn't work on mobile

##### Evaluation scores:

- Specification Adherence - 3
- User Interface - 3.5
- Javascript Style - 3
- Workflow - 4

From Hilary: Christine was wonderful to work with on Idea Box. She is very strong with Javascript and was able to teach me a lot about syntax and refactoring. Christine has a very good workflow and taught how to manage github. I appreciated working with Christine because she is always positive, patient, and kind. Because of those wonderful qualities, I know Christine will continue to find success as a developer.


#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked list is an application that utilizes jQuery. There are two input fields that allow the user to input a title and URL of the bookmark. Once these are created there is a button for mark as read and a remove button. The user is also able to see how a counter with read, unread, and total bookmrks.

##### Evaluation comments:
- javascript is looking good!
- opportunities to refactor and pivot to closures
- love the functions

##### Evaluation scores:
- Functional expectations - 4
- HTML Style - 3.5
- CSS Style - 4
- Fundamental Javascript Style - 3
- Workflow - 4

From Adam: I worked with Christine on the Linked List project. Christine was a great partner and our final product turned out better than I expected. Christine is a hard worker and took the extra step to break down any solution if I was unclear as to how a specific function was working



#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lrknaff/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The focus of this project was to build a game where the user inputs two numbers that they want to guess in between. A number is randomly generated in that range, and the game tells them if they are too high or too low until they select the correct one.


##### Evaluation scores:
- Functional expectations - 4
- Fundamental Javascript Style - 3

From Devin: I was excited to work with Christine for my first project because she brought a lot of fundamental skills that I knew I could learn from right away. It was great to be able to see how she approached the problem and broke down the project. She was flexible in her availability and knew that it was important to work together in person for our first project. She also has a great ability to talk out loud about her workflow and explain why she wanted to approach a problem the way she did. Overall, it was a great first project experience.



## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- Lacey: I worked with Lacey and Devin on our first project, Number Guesser. She was a great partner to have for this project. Lacey approached problems in a very logical way, and even though we were just learning Javascript she had a very solid understanding of the concepts. The way she approaches coding and her willingness to collaborate will make her a great programmer, and I look forward to working with her more.


- Devin: I worked with Devin and Lacey on our first project, Number Guesser. Devin was a great addition to the team and I thought we all worked really well together. I appreciated the way she tackled problems and was able to see how everything fit together. Having this perspective is so important. Devin works hard to produce solid code and ensure the success of the team, and I look forward to working with her more.

- Adam: I worked with Adam on our second project, linked-list. This was the first project I've had at Turing where we divided up almost all of the responsibilities, and I thought it was a great experience.  We were able to coordinate what we were doing and help each other as needed while each making significant progress.  Adam has a very solid understanding of Javascript and how to approach different problems. He also understood the importance of collaboration and was flexible with my schedule, making him a great partner!

- Hilary: Hilary and I worked together on Ideabox. Hilary is great with CSS, which was so helpful for this project! She is also able to think logically through problems and break them down into smaller pieces. This is an incredibly useful mindset to have. The way she approaches code and her drive to deliver solid work will make her a great programmer.

- Ryan: Ryan and I worked together on Gametime. For this project we built the game 2048. This was a very complicated game, but from the very beginning Ryan was able to see the bigger picture and broke down what we needed to do. This logical component was the hardest piece of the project, but he was able to think through all of the moving pieces, which is so important. Ryan was a great person to work with. He was flexible with when we could work, and was encouraging throughout the project. His solid understanding of Javascript and CSS, and how he approaches coding will make him a successful programmer.

- Dale: Dale joined Ryan and I on Gametime, and I am really glad he did! Ryan and I worked closely with Dale before he officially joined the team since we were doing the same game. I was incredibly impressed with how thorough Dale thought out the approach.  His attention to detail made a great difference in how we wrote our code. When he joined our team he was able to jump right into our code, and did some great work, especially with finding bugs and refactoring.  I look forward to working more with him.

### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part

- I am a part of LGBTuring and plan to go to future events. I appreciate that this group exists.

- I am a member of the Pahlka posse, which in my opinion is the best posse. We are a dedicated group of people focused on civic tech. I have been a part of this posse since it started in March. One of our main projects is developing an app that will help low-income residents in Denver find housing that best meets their needs. This [README](https://github.com/bethsebian/affordable-housing-app/blob/master/README.markdown) further describes our project. It has been especially rewarding for me to contribute my GIS skills to the project. I am excited to see this posse continue to do great things!
