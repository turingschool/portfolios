# Christine Gamble - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I am excited about being in the front-end program and continuing to develop my skills. My health is something that has impacted me in the past at Turing, and I am hoping I can find ways to move forward and be successful despite these issues.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

The goal of this project was to prepare for the final assessment. It was a project we did in module 1, but this time had to be implemented with React.

##### Evaluation comments:
- read through the spec a little more
- don't use document.getElementById
- understand the data flow a little more
- fundamental javascript/react style is a little soft because of the mixing of react and vanilla js.
- with that being said I feel confident that you can get it together.
- loved the breaking out of small dumb components

##### Evaluation scores:
- Functional Expectations - 3.5
- Fundamental Javascript/React Style - 3


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were three group projects this module: 2DoBox, Shoot the Breeze, and Fire-bae.

#### Fire-bae

* [Project Link](https://netwerker-3d622.firebaseapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

This project involved building an app to keep track of contacts.  The goals of the projects were to be test-driven, use build tools, be designed by the student, use a mobile-first approach, and be accessible.


##### Evaluation scores:
- Specification Adherence - 4
- Risk Taking and Creativity - 4
- Design - 3

- HTML Style - 3.5
- CSS/Sass Style - 3.5
- JavaScript Style - 3

From Graham: Christine was my partner, along with Matt, for Fire-Bae/Netwerker. I fould her to be a good listener and patient with me when I made coding mistakes or waded into problematic territory. I learned a lot from them both about teamwork and group/partner coding. I thought that Christine and I worked particularly well together near the end of the project when we were doing final CSS/SASS refactoring together; we established a nice rhythm and got a lot done.



#### Shoot the Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/shoot-the-breeze-1)
* [Project Link](https://shoot-the-breeze-1be68.firebaseapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

The goal of this project was to build a simple chatroom application. The main goals were to test all components in Enzyme, robustly test the App with unit tests, use Firebase to store chats, and use Webpack for build tools.

#### Evaluation comments:
- loved the bread crumbs left
- look into making your components more dumb
- great tests. Look into stubbing.

##### Evaluation scores:

- Specification Adherence - 3
- Component Architecture - 4
- User Interface - 4
- CSS/Sass Style - 4

* [Project Link](https://ccgamble.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

This project took the code from an IdeaBox project from the previous module, and pivoted it. Instead of a list of ideas, this application would hold a to-do list.  The project focused on accessibility, feature tests using selenium, and webpack.


##### Evaluation scores:
- Specification Adherence - 4
- Accessibility - 4
- User Interface - 3.5

From Chelsea: I enjoyed working with Christine on 2ToBox. She is talented and knowledgable about testing and refactoring javascript. She is also fun to work with and keeps the work from getting too serious. We really clicked on working through technical problems together and it was one of the few projects where my partner and I got through the extensions, which was awesome!
Honestly, I donâ€™t have any big suggestions for improvement. The only thing I may have changed was working on tests earlier in the process.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- Chelsea: Chelsea and I worked together on 2DoBox. She was a great partner to have. We clicked really well and flew through the project. Chelsea is very strong in her technical skills, but more importantly she approaches problems in a very logical way. We started with the goal of taking an agile approach with this project, but for the most part we didn't create tests until the end. I know I struggle to create tests along the way, and it is good to be aware of. The way Chelsea approaches code and her drive to deliver solid work will make her a great programmer.

- Hilary: Hilary and I worked on Shoot the Breeze, and it was great to work on another project together. Hilary's ability to think through things logically and see the bigger picture was so helpful in this project, when we were still learning how to break out components in React. I liked the balance we had of working together on some parts, and splitting up other work. Hilary doesn't give up on challenges and has a great approach to problem solving, and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

- Matt: I worked with Matt, along with Graham, on the fire-bae project. Matt is clearly very strong in his technical skills, and it was a great experience to work with him. I felt like we had a good mixture of different people driving throughout the project, and this allowed us all to share ideas and learn from each other. I was especially impressed with his desire to learn more and his drive to push the boundaries of the project.

- Graham: I worked with Graham, along with Matt, on the fire-bae project. I thought the three of us worked really well together. It is clear that Graham has a solid understanding of React and Javascript. I was especially impressed with his workflow and hope to implement some of those practices in my work.


### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part

- I am a part of LGBTuring and plan to go to future events. I appreciate that this group exists.

- I am a member of the Verou posse. I have been a part of the Pahlka posse for a long time, but decided it was time to try something different. It was really great to have a posse that was more front-end focused. I have some experience with data visualization, but design is new to me, so this was a great posse to be a part of and learn from!
