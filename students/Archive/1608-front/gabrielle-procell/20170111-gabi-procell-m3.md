# Gabi Procell - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Professional development and taking a more hands-on approach to projects are areas that I wanted to improve upon. Honestly, I struggled with this module. I feel this struggle was due to a mixture of personal conflicts as well as simply not feeling that my coding skills were up to par for this module. In hindsight, I feel that I should have repeated module 2 despite being able to pass. I would like to repeat this module after taking a module off to try to ramp up my skills.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Anesthesia App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/anesthesia-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

**Description**
I came to tech from a background in surgical veterinary medicine. One of the areas that I was always frustrated with was the form used to record readings during an anesthetic procedure. This anesthesia app aims to calm the woes of the anesthetic technician by making this form easier to look at and interact with. A user is able to log in, add a patient, add a procedure for the patient, and take readings for that procedure. All information is stored in Firebase so that when a user logs in, they can find a patient as well as a history of patient procedures.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Weather Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

**Description**
A weather app created with React/Redux that allows the user to see different forecast information for a given city as well as set favorite cities to pin to the homepage. 


**Evaluation scores**
*Specification Adherence*

    * 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

*Redux Architecture*

    * 4 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary  application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

*Routing*

    * 4 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

*JavaScript Style*

    * 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Testing*

    * 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

*Workflow*

    * 3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

*Troubleshooting*

    * 4 - Most to all questions were posed to instructors with expected information

(feedback to me)

**Feedback to others**
*To Andrew Crist* </br>
- In comparison to our last project, I feel that his ability to adapt to new frameworks has grown exponentially. 
- Despite the difficulty of the project, he persevered and tackled the testing portion of the project(which was new for him, I believe). 
- I feel that Andrew is making better use of his time since our last project.
*To Christine Gamble* </br>
- She is great at initiating the project by just putting code on the page.
- She is quick to research and try different methods of solving the problem.
- Did a great job with communicating about issues with code, or successes with code.
*To Alex Pilewski* </br>
- He is great at initiating the project by just putting code on the page.
- Could benefit from a little more pseudocode and/or communication with group.
- He is very confident in his abilities to problem-solve.  I feel that this raises team morale and confidence.

#### RemEMBER

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/1608-remember-5/tree/master/app)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

**Description:**
  Using Ember, we created a notepad-like app with full CRUD functionality.
  
  We did not have commit rights to the master branch. All changes had to be made via pull requests that were reviewed by instructors and merged to master when approved.
  
**Assessed by Multiple Instructors**

**Feedback to others**
  *To Maia Stone* </br>
    * This project required more communication than normal because we were working on so many different branches. Maia did a great job with communicating where she was at on an issue, and if when she was making a pull request.
    * I often found myself getting stuck with the flow of Ember on issues that I decided to take on. I would communicate that with Maia, and she took the time to help me work through those issues.


## D: Professional Development

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Link to Flower Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18_iOoJURUK6VgRwPNbHyJ2w27lhmaTWJ7eSa4EK8PP0/edit?usp=sharing)

The professional development sessions were top-notch this mod. Even though the Flower Exercise is very intense and time-consuming, I found it extremely valuable in how I go about describing myself. I also participated in the StrengthsFinder groups again, and found these to be very valuable towards my personal storytelling.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

*From Joey Stansfield(1608 BE)*
>Hey Gabi, It's been great doing things with you this module and all modules. I really appreciate your accountability and willingness to take on tasks. Thanks for showing up to the Turing Lab and for helping with some of the organization there. Thanks for getting the LAN party together, it was super fun and we should do it again. You've been involved with the whole "community" part of my portfolio since mod 1 and having you around has made all the awkward things (like public speaking) 
feel a little easier.

### Playing a Part

* Joined the Maker Posse as Miyamoto posse had dissolved :-(
* Formed a board games group to play at lunch twice weekly and on Friday nights.
* Organized a LAN party that was held before the holiday break
* This is my third module as plant caretaker. I have delegated Blake street plant duties to Brett Rivers

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md)

     >To be fair, I had to research what a microaggression was before coming to this Gear Up session. I was surprised that there was a term for these 'annoyances' that I experience commonly. I don't tend to think of myself as one to be easily offended, and I do like to think that I know the difference between ignorance and rudeness/bigotry/hatred/idiocracy(?). A big takeaway from this session was that I need to learn to speak up more when I have these experiences. The following week, I found out that some Turing community members made a Slack channel to mock microaggressions in response to the Gear Up topic.  Hearing of this offended me, made me feel smaller as a person, and reinforced the takeaway that I need to let others know that this behavior is not acceptable. 

#### Journey Mapping

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

     >I found this gear up session to be a bit confusing initially. It is still a little unclear as to why this subject matter was brought up. If anything, I did take away that the experiences we interviewed each other on were experiences that we all shared. The journey that we mapped shared several very similar key points. Our questions that we asked one another were very unbiased, and it was interesting to hear about what we do share in common. Because of this, I wasn’t sure on how to discover tactics to practice empathy.
   
#### Grit Mindset

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
  
    https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

1. *Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up. Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?*
     This module has been particularly difficult for me. I think I could examine parts of my struggle through the lens of grit.
2. *Is that lens helpful?*
      Yes and no
3. *Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?*
      I feel that it is problematic in that it leaves no room for breaks and taking care of one’s own self.
4. *As you head into the homestretch of your time at Turing and begin to look toward your job search, it will be helpful to begin to articulate the things that, in Hilmantel's words, you can find "enduringly fascinating." What parts of your experience at Turing has lit that fire?*
      My first 2 modules and participating in Miyamoto posse
5. *Brainstorm 4-5 descriptions of work that really engages you (algorithmically complex challenges, imagining user needs and creating something elegant and enjoyable to use, designing backend architecture to support open-ended specification).*
    * Creating something elegant and enjoyable to use
    * Creating something that makes someone’s workflow easier 
    * Bridging gaps in communication between different groups
    * Creating tools that help others learn in a different way
6. *How can you create opportunities to build around the work that engages you in your remaining time at Turing?*
      I can try to change my mindset when starting a new project and try to frame the project within the descriptions of things that I enjoy. If those descriptions are not what is requested on the spec, I can always ask an instructor for permission to build the project in that way, or work on a side project that meets those goals.


------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

Will set up a schedule for a personalized mod-off plan.
Auditing classes in both mods 2 and 3.
Will set up individual projects that help strengthen weak spots. 

### Outcome

Fail

Taking a module off, then either repeating 3 or testing into 4 depending on the situation.
