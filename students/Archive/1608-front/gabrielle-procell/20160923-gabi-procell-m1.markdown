# Gabi Procell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
There was a small mission of redemption for my transition into Front End Mod 1.
I wanted to get a solid understanding of OOP in Javascript this module, and be able to work better with relationships between multiple objects in my projects.

  *Functional Expectations*

    3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

  *Fundamental JavaScript Style*

    2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

**Feedback to me**
*From Nick Chambers:*

My project (Number Guesser) with Gabi went smoothly, and I felt grateful to have such an enjoyable experience during my first project at Turing. Gabi communicated clearly about her time constraints, work style, and technical strengths. Since she had gone through Mod 1 of the back-end program, I looked to her to lead us through the big picture workflow, and she was especially generous with her knowledge about Git. As we were coming close to achieving "level 4" functionality, we were both on the same page with wanting perfect our Javascript and wracked our brains trying to figure out how to implement the final touches. I'm proud of how much effort we put into the project and how smoothly it felt to work with a solid partner. I learned a lot from working with Gabi during out first project, and hopefully we can work again in the future.

#### Linked List

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/linked-list)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

**Description:** <br>
  Linked List utilized jQuery to create an application that would allow a user to input individual bookmarks, mark each bookmark as "Read", and to remove the bookmark, as well as bookmarks that had been marked as "Read".

**Assessed by Bree Thomas**

**Evaluation scores:**

*Functional Expectations*

  4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

*Fundamental JavaScript Style*

  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

*Workflow*

  3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

*HTML Style*

  3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

*CSS Style*

  3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

  **Feedback to me**
  *From Maia Stone:*

  Things that I appreciated during our pairing for Linked List were: your willingness to work together on difficult areas of the project, you openly communicated your thoughts during workflow so that I didn't have to guess what you were thinking, and that you were willing to ask questions when we were stuck on problems. My only recommendation for you would be that when you are feeling overwhelmed by a problem, take a break, breathe, and really try to break the problem into smaller pieces. Remember that we all are in the same boat, and you are not alone! Again, I thought our time together on our project went very smoothly, and I'm proud of the project that we delivered.   Thanks for being a great partner, Maia!

  #### Idea Box

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/idea-box)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

**Description**<br>

**Assessed by Bree Thomas**

**Evaluation scores:**

*Specification Adherence*

  3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

*User Interface*

  3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

*JavaScript Style*

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Workflow*

  4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

  **Feedback to me**
During the times we have paired, Gabi has always been pleasant to work with. She is a light-hearted and thoughtful person whose qualities translate well into writing software. During times of high stress, she is able to ground busy energy and be cognizant of when to break and when to keep going. She has consistently presented himself as eager to learn, kind, and well attuned to focusing at the problem at hand. Overall, I can say Gabi will be an asset to any team she ends up on and look forward to our future collaboration during Turing!

#### Game Time

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/game-time)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

**Evaluation scores**
# Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

# User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

# Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

**Feedback to me**

*From Graham Nessler*
It was a pleasure to work with you on Game Time. You were a valuable partner who added a lot of terms of knowledge, moral support, and of course tests! Game time was our most difficult project so far, but I am glad that I had you as a collaborator for it. Thanks for the positive attitude and for helping us reach the finish line!

*From Lacey Knaff*

Working with Gabi on game time was great! She is concerned with the feelings of each person in the group and makes sure that every one is allowed time to play their part in the group. She is excellent with writing tests, and driven to accomplish anything she sets out to do. If she couldn't get a test to pass, or debug lines of code, she was asking for help within the Turing community and always had the best intentions for our group in mind by sharing her take aways in a clear and easy to understand way. Overall, she is a great team player and I really enjoyed working with her.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*To Ian Lancaster* <br>
Ian has been a great member to 1608 by being a supportive teammate for  others who are in need of help. He also brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from his career prior to Turing, and is able to interject those skills with the curriculum. Thank you, Ian, for all of the helpful pointers and your contributions to the cohort!

*To Hilary Lewis* <br>
Feedback for Hilary: Thank you for being our SAB rep this mod and voicing our concerns to the other cohorts and staff. I hope that you'll continue with a leadership role during your time at Turing!

*To Alex Pilewski* <br>
 Alex has been a truly supportive member to 1608.  He is easily approachable if you ever have any questions, and it is always interesting to hear his opinion on concepts in programming, design,  or other weird day-to-day stuff.

 *To Jeff Duke*<br>
My experiences in pairing with Jeff were spectacular. He is a wonderful teacher who challenges those that he is working with to develop efficient solutions to most, if not all, of their Javascript problems. I appreciated his approach because it did not involve him stealing any learning from me. Jeff also did a wonderful job of utilizing the concepts I currently knew to help me arrive to a working conclusion. Thank you Jeff, for guiding me through my difficult JS struggles!

*To Kyle Misencik*
Kyle has been a huge help with my OOP woes during mod 1. I often have a hard time navigating through my code when relationships become very complicated, and Kyle served as a sherpa to explain why I was having errors with my code. Also, explaining the concept of webpack was an enormous help. He's always been very approachable when I did not have him scheduled from pairing, and is eager to help.  Thanks again!

### Being a Community Member

*From Matt Kaufman*<br>
Gabi is super friendly and engaging to talk to! She cares a lot about others and has really positive energy when approaching problems. Any time I worked with Gabi, I felt comfortable and equally collaborative. She's awesome.

*From Alex Pilewski* <br>
She is a super positive member of the community and her compassion for the Turing plant community and ensuring our workspaces are livable is a contribution that should not go unacknowledged! Woo!

### Playing a Part

* I continued participating in Miyamoto posse and enjoyed learning concepts of game development outside of the curriculum.
  * Participated in Strengths Finder Assessment
  * Although I am no longer a part of the back end program, I still am the plant caretaker for the plants housed at the Blake Street campus.
  * I am spearheading a weekly fridge cleaning for the front-end campus.
