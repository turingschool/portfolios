# Nick Chambers - (Mod 2 - Frontend) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to become proficient with ReactJS, strengthen my fundamental Javascript skills, and help mod 1 students learn and gain confidence. I also wanted to write a metric shit ton of code and program every single day for six weeks, which I did.

For the next mod, I'd like to have more consistency in my JS style and make every project as strong as it could possibly be.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Evaluator: Meeka
## Student: Nick
## Notes:

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Mod2 projects helped us go from zero to one hundred with ReactJS and allowed us to get an introduction to structuring pre-packaged databases. React is sweet!

#### Number Guesser In React

* [https://github.com/nnchambs/number-guesser-in-react-]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html]()

Instructor: Jhun

Comments:
the skeleton of the app is there
there are some holes in passing state from component to component
not a huge fan of using document.querySelector
I know you can do this wayy better fam.
Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

## C: Group Work & Projects
#### 2Do-Box Pivot

* [https://github.com/mziccardi/2DoBox-Pivot]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot]

The 2DØ-BÖX Pivot was a pivot project on the module 1 face melter, Ideabox. Ideabox defined my Turing experience thus far and has been the project I struggled with the most. It was nice to come back to it in module 2 for sweet revenge.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox

"Working with Nick was awesome! He brings a lot to the table, and is starting to develop a serious “coding” mind. He was comfortable working in a group but also got serious work done when alone. I was impressed by how he worked through problems and tackled larger features. My advice for areas to improve are: 1) develop better project organization and workflow. The organization piece is breaking steps into smaller pieces. 2) Git. It’s simply a matter of repetition. I would gladly work with him again (and hope I get the chance)." - Ryan Westlake

"It was great working with nick on 2dobox pivot project. He was the testing king and was always ready to grind through the next problems." - Mike Ziccardi

#### Weathrly

* [https://github.com/gprocell927/weatherly]
* [Original Assignment]()

Weathrly was our first introduction to consuming an API (shouts to Jhun) and first project using React. It was ungraded, which allowed for a reasonable workflow and stress level while greatly expanding our skill set.

"It is amazing to see how much Nick has grown since pairing on our first Mod 1 project! His confidence has grown so much, and he had no hesitations about tackling our project and making the most metal weather app that we possibly could. I appreciate Nick's willingness to dive in, research, and experiment with different methods to achieve our goal. At the moment, I am at a loss to make suggestions of areas for Nick to improve upon. Keep up the good work, Nick!"

"Working with Nick on shoot-the-breeze was a distinct pleasure. I found it was easily the most painless workflow of the module. We never lost days to due to being unproductive and it is definitely a testament to Nick's foresight that we had some strategic pairings to keep us on track throughout the week(s). I believe we paired together for just about the entirety of the project and I thought we had a really nice rapport when working through the more difficult pieces of logic / debugging. I really don't have any sort of constructive criticism because Nick is a diligent worker and fine collaborator, just about everything you could ask for in a pardner. In addition to  all of that Nick is a fucking meme for a fucking reason." - Alex Pilewski

"It was great working with you Nick!  I'm super impressed that we were able build such a smooth functioning and cool app just the 2 of us.  Nice work on the react graphs!  I really enjoyed our workflow, pairing on tough things when we were together, but then splitting up to knock issues out.  I learned a lot from your debugging process.  Thanks for suggesting we use waffle. I really enjoyed it and found it to be a great tool.  My only suggestion would be to remain aware of the time remaining on the project and backlog.  For example, when we were trying to refactor but given the time, should have just moved forward and gone back to that later, when functionality was in place.  All in all, I'm glad we got to work on this bigger project together, that we worked through solving problems together and really like what we created!  " - Maia Stone

## D: Professional Skills
One of the things I'm grateful for in my Turing experience is the solid chunk of time we focus on soft/professional skills. These can be easy to brush over, but I've gained a lot from these sessions.

### Gear Up
#### (Voting)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

* It was great to discuss what it means to be a citizen in this country and what duties we have.
* I came away more excited to engage in the civic process.
* It was great to listen to other people's perspective on voting.
* Fuck Donald Trump

### Gear Up
#### (Resilience)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown]()

* It was great to talk with some folks I didn't know very well about the shared experience of stress and hard work at Turing.
* I appreciated hearing other people's perspective on what exactly resilience is.
* I enjoyed being able to carry the discussion over to our cohort retro.
* I'm still curious about the difference between grit and resilience.

### Gear Up
#### (Introversion)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown]

* This was probably my favorite Gear Up thus far.
* I was thrilled that we were able to discuss this as a cohort and take away some actionable steps from the discussion.
* It was also cool to see some of these ideas reflected in the curriculum during mod 2.
* I still struggle with the idea of introversion vs. extroversion and how they can limit our understanding of people.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Cold Email Workshop)
* I had a surprisingly fun time workshopping cold emails with Lia, Meg, and the rest of 1608. What I thought was going to be a useless exercise actually provided tons of value and perspective. It was so cool to get feedback on something as mundane as a cold email.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- To Ali Schlereth (Pahlka Posse Student Leader): "Ali served as one of our student leaders in the Pahlka Posse during this past module. She brought an enthusiasm for organization and productivity, and helped keep folks accountable when we were working on our healthy eating project/game. Thanks to her leadership, we had a func and productive module and managed to get a lot done. She definitely embodies the spirit of the Pahlka posse, which has been a highlight of my Turing experience so far. I'm psyched to spend two more blocks working with her. "

- To Ryan Westlake: I learned a lot from working with Ryan. He has a fiery motivation for improving his programming skills and already has an adept understanding of project management. Pairing with him and coming up with solutions was a fun experience, and he pushed our team to frontload our productivity during our project. I was grateful for his leadership and for steering our workflow so that we could manage to have a lighter work day over our weekend. I think Ryan's self motivation are going to take him very far, and as he pursues more leadership roles, I'd encourage him to practice active listening with team members and stay generous with his empathy. For such a young guy, he's already an impressive leader. Keep up the good work, man - it's been a pleasure!

- To Mike Ziccardi: I had a lovely experience working with Mike. He's a fun guy to share a project with and is always up for injecting a bit of levity into the experience of solving frustratingly complex problems. Mike has a solid work ethic and isn't afraid to put in long hours and grind through tasks. I think his grit and work ethic are going to help him continue to evolve into a truly adept programmer. While it's completely normal and expected to doubt oneself and feel hesitant when figuring out how to write software, I think Mike could benefit from trusting in his intelligence and work ethic. Sometimes when working to come up with a solution to a difficult problem, Mike will default to hesitation and lose his confidence. I think the one thing Mike could benefit most from is trusting that he is super smart and totally knows what he is doing. When working with Mike, I saw him come up with lots of elegant solutions to tough problems, but I think he sometimes needs a reminder that he’s truly a strong problem solver and smart dude. He should embrace it!

- To Alex Pilewski: Working on Shoot-the-Breeze with Alex was a real good time. His technical abilities are strong, he's good at finding solutions quickly, and our personalities jived well. The entire process was generally free of stress, and we kept on the same page by reviewing our Waffle page twice daily.  We sought help when we needed it, paired with students in higher modules than us, and worked through many of the technical problems as a duo. It was a solid learning experience, and I was impressed by the way Alex approaches coding. One suggestion I would make to him would be to logically break down and pseudo code before diving in to writing it. There were a few times when Alex would tackle a problem by beating it into submission with complicated logic and code. I think this is a great quality for coming up with a solution and achieving functionality, but a couple times it led to some unwieldy code. This could totally be remedied by either refactoring or taking more time to plan out a simpler solution ahead of time. No matter what, I was always impressed by his logic and had a great experience working with him.

- To Gabi Procell: This was my second time working with Gabi during Turing, and it was so cool to see how we've both grown our technical skillset during the past ~12 weeks. She's a very hard worker who gets things done, while also making time and space for many good laughs. It was a real pleasure working with her again, and I think she's a solid programmer who could trust in her abilities more. Keep learning and keep crushing it, Gab!!

- To Maia Stone: Maia and I took on the sizeable "Fire-Bae" project with one another, and we assembled a minimal viable product for a kids-oriented budgetting app. We spent a good amount of time pairing together, while also dividing and conquering on much of the work. We had a solid workflow throughout most of the project, and I was constantly impressed by Maia's work ethic. She goes all in, gets things done, and stays very oriented towards productivity and taking care of business. I really admire her commitment to learning the craft of coding while also doing the myriad other things she does with her time. I think she sometimes needs to trust that she knows what she's doing  and that she is a talented coder. There were a few times when she would get frustrated a little early on in the process of trying to debug a problem and ask for help or seek out a quicker solution. I think Maia could work on grinding through problems a bit more and trust in her abilities. Alas, we were but a team of two, and we had less man/woman hours than the other groups in our cohort. I appreciated Maia's eagerness to get shit done and learned a lot from working with her. She's a smart, fun partner and is going to be an awesome developer.
P.S - I am really really really grateful for her asking questions during class. Most of the time I am too lazy or scared to ask them myself.

### Being a Community Member

- "I really appreciated your help with Idea Box. You clearly had your own project to work on and were incredibly gracious with your time- in looking at our code, answering our questions, and helping us get everything to be functional. Thanks!" -Steph

- "Pairing with Nick was a huge help in furthering my knowledge of programming. He made it clear that he truly cares about helping along the newer students at Turing by obliging to last minute pairings and working on difficult problems until the solution is found. Despite the stressful atmosphere, Nick emits a perfect balance of professionalism coupled with a calm humor that is much appreciated during "crunch time"."

- "Nick - you're always so willing to help, even if we stop you for an impromptu question. Appreciate the time you've given and the expertise you've shared. You have a great way of breaking down problems and making complex concepts seem simple. Thanks for all the help!"

### Playing a Part

- I'm an enthusiastic member of the Pahlka Posse. It's been one of the highlights of my Turing experience thus far and has been an amazing social space to hang out and work in.

- I LOVE PAIRING
