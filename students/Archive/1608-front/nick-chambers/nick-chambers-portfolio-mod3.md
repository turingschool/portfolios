#Module 3 (Front-end)

##Individual Assessment
- 3+ - All complete with very little guidance.
- 4 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them
- 4 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Did not need instructor guidance on how to work with the endpoints.

-4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
-3 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately.
-4 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
-3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
-3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
-3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.
-4 - Most to all questions were posed to instructors with expected information

Feedback: Self-Solicited and collected from Weather Forecast and Remember
###"This module Nick did a great job taking over leadership for some of the Pahlka content. We restructured how our Friday Spike sessions worked and Nick took on leading a couple of these sessions without hesitation. As a backend student, I greatly appreciated the exposure to frontend development tools and workflow. In addition, I appreciate how present Nick is to our posse community and the project we have undertaken. It makes the work much smoother and more enjoyable with a committed team. - Ali Schlereth"

###"It has been (and continues to be) good getting to know Nick as part of Pahlka Posse. His willingness to dive in to totally new concepts has been massively valuable to us throughout the mods. He co-taught a D3 lesson that was approachable, useful, and fun. I look forward to continuing to work with Nick and to seeing where his talents take him in the future! - Noah Berman"

###"Nick brings a certain positivety to groups, which is really great, especially during stressful times. Going into this project he expressed interest in taking on his areas of weakness which were styling and css and I was really impressed by his and Graham's initiative to take that on. They both did a great job focusing on something they hadn't had much practice on. I think initially he was feeling a little bit fuzzy on Redux concept, as we all were, but really starting getting a grasp on it by the end. Overall, just really impressed with his curiosity and passion to take on all aspects of the project. - Lacey Knaff"

###"This was my second project with Nick, and again, it was so great. Nick is several things 1) a great guy 2) fun to be around 3) a solid developer. He brought ideas that I would never have thought of. There were several times where I was working through a challenging spot in the project and hit a dead end and Nick would jump in with a fresh set of eyes that made a big difference. Nick also works hard, which is an attribute I admire. The night before it was due, he was up late finishing the last few items. My constructive feedback is to be more comfortable driving a project, or atleast a large portion of it. I believe this would help him get better at communicating code. Overall, and in almost every way, it was a pleasure to work with Nick, and I would be excited to do it a third time. - Ryan Westlake"

###"Nick and I were partners, along with Ryan and Lacey, for the second weather project and our first project for Mod 3. We took on the styling, since we both felt that we were fairly weak in this area. I feel that our final product was solid, though we did have to ask Lacey to bail us out a couple times. Nick has a great disposition and is always willing to take on tough tasks. The only issue that arose is that at times, we could have communicated a bit better, both with each other and with other members of the team. Overall, though, it was great to work with Nick, and I hope we get to have a paired project together. - Graham Nessler"

##"Nick and I worked together on remEMBER. We mainly split up the work, but also collaborated some. I was very impressed with his problem solving abilities and determination to get the work done. I appreciated his flexibility and positivity throughout the project. Nick is a great developer and I look forward to working with him more in the future! - Christine Gamble"

#Community:

##Microagressions
- This one was a sticky wicket, but I really appreciated Beth's comments that while the term "microagression" is imperfect, it offers us a vocabulary for dealing with, what I think, is an important and powerful idea. Even though it opened the field to some disrespectful bullshit, it was still a good thing to discuss as a community.

##Journey Mapping
- This one was a good, practical exercise that didn't generate much conversation or community building. As a front-end developer, I found it quite useful, though, and I'm glad we had the time to practice this skill.

##Grit
- This was a little bit like The Resilience Gear Up : Part Deux. I think it's an important and salient idea/topic for the Turing community to discuss, and it was definitely worthwhile to discuss this within our individual cohorts. Always a good convo with the Turing crowd.

## Outcome
Pass - Pending tests
