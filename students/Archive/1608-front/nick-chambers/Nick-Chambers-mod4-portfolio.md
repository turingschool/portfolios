# Nick Chambers - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was originally hoping to get a job so I wouldn't have to take the final assessment and could drop out early, but then I learned that writing back-end JavaScript was a whole lot of fun. I felt like I was able to round out my knowledge well with two projects in React/Redux and two in VanillaJS with jQuery. All the back-end and database experience with Express and Knex/Postgres was really illuminating as well. I feel confident as I head out into the world and convince someone to pay me to do this stuff. I can't believe how much I've learned and how much more cool stuff there is still to learn. Thanks, Turing!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module's projects were fun, and it was a real treat getting to write server-side code and build applications from top to bottom. I didn't really feel like the material was overwhelming compared to other modules, but the work load was typical Turing. I thought the curriculum for this module rounded things out nicely.

#### Jet-Fuel

*   [GitHub URL]()
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

A URL shortener built with Express, Postgres, and jQuery.

(evaluation comments)

Total Score - 97/150

"Mod4...where do I start? Stress has been high and it's been incredibly tough to focus on jobs AND schoolwork. This conflict of focus has been present for the entire mod and definitely so working with Nick. That said, Nick knows how to grind. He can drop into deep levels of focus and crank out great code very quickly. Personally, I think Nick is one of the most incredible human beings on this earth. Emperically, he's one of the best human beings on this earth. Hypothetically, if Nick were required to repeat Mod4, I'd repeat it with him just so I could work with him again." - Andrew Crist

#### Realtime

*   [GitHub URL]()
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/real-time.html)

A polling application built with Express, Web Sockets, and jQuery.

"I was happy to get the chance to work with Nick before finishing Turing! He is a calm and thoughtful developer. When I felt stressed about the project, he was chill. He is also dependable in completing the work he's committed to and thinking of creative solutions. I think one thing to work on would be to focus more on requirements. We got somewhat distracted trying to build a database for the first few days that was an extension for the project instead of focusing on the requirements." - Chelsea Skovgaard

#### Imposter Syndrome/CK5

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nnchambs/ck5)
*   [Original Assignment](hhttp://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

An two-track audio player (with a crossfader) built in Electron with React/Redux and the WebAudio API.

"Great job working with the WebAudio API (not something a ton of people have become experts with just yet). Despite not be able to finish the Analyzer portion, the app was pared down to a solid MVP to deliver a complete experience. A+ prioritizing."

Total Score - 166 / 175

#### Volit/Capstone

*   [GitHub URL - private](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/volit)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

A MVP built in React/Redux, Express, and Postgres for an admin user to help manage volunteer events.

- Final Score: 240 / 325 (Pass on the skin of your teeth)

- "This was my third time working with Nick over the course of my time at Turing and it's been really great to see his growth throughout the program. I've always been really impressed with his ability and desire to tackle difficult problems and this last project that was particulary evident as he took on a lot of the complex backend logic. I didn't work super closely with Nick during this project, so it was hard for me to take a critical look at areas of improvement, but I think from the outside looking in, he could work on trying to take a step back, especially when he's just spinning his wheels on a problem. Maybe it would be helpful to start working on a different peice of the project to give himself some space from the problem, and then come back to the problem later. Either way, his work ethic and desire to learn are going to be great assets to any development team." -L. Knaff 

- "Once again, Nick was awesome to work with! As he moves from Turing to real-world development, my biggest recommendation is to develop a sense for when to stick with a problem himself and when to seek the help of senior or more experienced developers. It's a fine line but believe it would be helpful. Can't wait to see where his career takes him!" - Mr. Ryan Westlake
 

## D: Professional Skills
In module four, unemployed life is nigh, so we had to keep those professional skills sharp! 

### Gear Up

#### Automation
- This topic generated some of the most interesting conversation for a gearup thus far (second only to Microaggressions). It wasn't a topic I had engaged with thoroughly before. It got me thinking, turned me on to some good new reads (Four Futures by Peter Frase), and I had fun engaging with some libertarian smooth brains. I realized that I better get my JavaScript skills leveled up quickly, because those robots are coming for my job. 

#### UBI
- This piggybacked well on the automation gear up and built on those conversations nicely, but I felt like the readings were less than stellar. I realized we are going to have to change our societal relationship to work and capital once the robots take our jobs away. I yearn for socialism in my lifetime. 

#### Tragedy of the Commons
- This seemed to be less about the idea of the tragedy of the commons and more about the topic of bias. It was interesting to dissect the idea of bias, especially within the tech industry, but the Parable of the Polygons was a little bit of a weird jumping off point for that discussion, I thought. 


### PROtocol
#### (Session Name)

*   I sent out 15+ cold outreach e-mails and a handful of lukewarm to warm outreach e-mails and Slack messages. 
*   I had a technical interview at Waffle during week 1 and practiced whiteboarding with instructors and peers.
*   I had a handful of coffee dates
*   I filled out my alumni portfolio and organized my shit


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- I gave feedback to all of my project partners and three of my posse pals.

### Being a Community Member

- "Nick has always been one of the most stalwart members of Pahlka Posse -- whether that's arranging and then leading a remote interview in a matter of days or bringing mad front end skills to our various projects or any number of other things. He was also willing to help me troubleshoot a persistent React problem on our capstone project (that I had caused because of... reasons) during a week when we were all feeling the time crunch. I look forward to seeing the wild and extremely good things he makes as his career no-doubt takes off!" - Noah Berman

- "As always, Nick has been a great contributor to Pahlk Posse. He is reliably present to the group and willing to share of his ideas and energy. He showed great leadership this inning, leading a technical spike on Leaflet as well as a networking/mentor spike with Horace where he lead a great conversation. He took the time to do outside background work to make the session a success during wk5 which is never easy. Thanks Nick!" - Ali Schlereth


### Playing a Part

- I chit-chatted extensively - and I mean extensively -  about Turing's front-end program with a prospective student who reached out to me on LinkedIn.
- I arranged the student support system for the Pahlka Posse to pair students with upper module students and mentors. 
- Paired with mod3 front-end and mod4 back-end students.
- Volunteered a the Boys and Girl's Club Cope Branch to teach kids coding and programmatic thinking with Turing alums
