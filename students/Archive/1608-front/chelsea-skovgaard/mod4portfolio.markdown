## D: Community

### Summary
This module I contributed to the community by actively participating in Gear Ups, Friday
Speakers, and Joan Clarke meetings. I also paired and worked with students in lower modules in addition to leading a couple spike sessions for building our protest application. Lastly, I was the Turing Tweeter for a day and wrote a blog post on a week at Turing sharing my experience at Turing with the outside community.

### Gear Ups
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Gear Up Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
The data visualization/interaction of the parable of the polygons was useful and informative.
It did a good job of illustrating how small individual bias can lead to large collective
bias, how the past can haunt the present, and the importance of demanding diversity
near you. The discussion was useful because it showed how even when reading the
same material and questions, we tend to approach the questions in a different way
depending on our backgrounds.

#### Automation

* [Gear Up Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This was probably one of my least favorite gear ups. While I think the two films make a
good point about possible increases of automation, I think it would have been good
to have another perspective. The discussion was good and focused on thinking about
ways as software developers we can contribute to improving the lives of others that
may be negatively impacted by changes in technology.

#### Universal Basic Income
* [Gear Up Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
This was a interesting gear up. I think that my background working with homeless individuals and people
receiving TANF gave me useful information to contribute to the discussion. I think it is useful to learn
about these concepts to be more aware of the topics when we hear about them in news and media.

### Receiving Feedback

From Staci McWilliams, Mod 2 FE:
Chelsea is always a pleasure to be around. She is knowledgeable, kind, encouraging and positive! My only regret is that I didn't seek her out earlier to pair with. Listening to her talk through a problem was so beneficial for me. I look forward to working with her again as soon as possible!

From Casey Macaulay, Mod 2 BE:
Christine & Chelsea, thank you so much for your initial ideation on this project, it really spoke to me and I was excited to contribute even if it required me learning skills beyond what we had covered at Turing. Your positivity and faith in Katy, Charlotte and I is what enabled this venture to be a success. I really enjoyed working with you and can't wait to see what you both achieve in your careers as developers. You have both inspired me to view software development as an opportunity to engage in civic activism through coding.

From Matt:
Working with Chelsea on JetFuel was a really great experience. She was dedicated to the project and understood when I had other obligations related to Demo night. She really took her share of the work and did a great job. The only thing I'd recommend is that she continues to challenge herself as a developer beyond Turing! There's so much more to learn out there and Chelsea is on her way to becoming a great developer who's heart is in the right place - using her skills for good. Keep it up =)

From Nick:
I was psyched to get the chance to work with Chelsea on the RealTime app. She's super proficient, fun to work with, and gets things done. We worked hard out the gates to attempt to implement a postgres database to complement our web sockets, but ended up pivoting once things began to slow down. She did a great job of being realistic and using her better judgement to keep the project on track. I'd encourage her to keep pushing herself to learn after Turing because I think she's on a really solid trajectory. She's great!

From Christine:
It was so great to work on another project with Chelsea! I really appreciate that this project started before the capstone and it was in response to a true need we saw. We were able to work together and collaborate with others to decide how to handle the different challenges and determine what the MVP should be. Chelsea worked incredibly hard throughout the project, and I especially appreciate her UI/UX skills. In the future, she could work on being more decisive. While it is good to be flexible, we went back and forth a lot at the beginning trying to decide what the project for the capstone should be, what framework we should use, etc. Chelsea is a great developer, and I'm excited to see where she ends up.

### Giving Feedback

To Matt:
It was great working with Matt on the JetFuel pair project. During pair programming, he listens, explains, and collaborates with ease. We could go over concepts and come to an understanding quickly, which was important when learning so many new concepts and implementing them over the course of a week. I was impressed that even with the stress Matt had from prepping for Demo Night Finals during our project week how calm and focused he was when working on the project.

To Nick:
I was happy to get the chance to work with Nick before finishing Turing! He is a calm and thoughtful developer. When I felt stressed about the project, he was chill. He is also dependable in completing the work he's committed to and thinking of creative solutions. I think one thing to work on would be to focus more on requirements. We got somewhat distracted trying to build a database for the first few days that was an extension for the project instead of focusing on the requirements.

To Christine:
It was fun working on the capstone with Christine. I love that we got to go through multiple steps of developing an application from developing/brainstorming an idea, creating a story boards, creating issues, and coding the MVP. Christine implemented an impressive workflow from creating issues, closing issues with PRs, and commenting on PRs. She is dependable and a great problem solver. She took on parts of the project and worked on them to address bugs and create solutions even when stumped. As far as ways to improve and grow, I think she could work on her agile workflow and doing more testing as she codes.

To Casey, Katy, and Charlotte:
Our backend team! We’ve been so impressed with your willingness and enthusiasm to jump into the One Nation Many Voices project. You each provided valuable perspectives to the planning phase, and the API you created was really helpful in building out the MVP. We know you are going to be successful developers with your work ethic and problem solving abilities, and we hope you’ll continue working on this project!
