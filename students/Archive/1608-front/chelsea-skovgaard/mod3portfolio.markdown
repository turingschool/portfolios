# Chelsea Skovgaard - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I want to take time to become more confident doing foundational JavaScript. My plan to do this is to do Exercisms regularly and complete JavaScript30. I want to complete a personal project that I am proud of and present at Demo Night. I also want to go to meetups, finalize my resume, and portfolio.

Feedback from Hilary:
I always enjoy working with Chelsea because she works very efficiently through problems. Chelsea came into the project having a limited understanding of Redux and she was able to logically share her ideas on setting up components and reducers. I enjoyed Chelsea's willingness to help me on tests when I was getting frustrated by suggesting that we Screenhero and she worked through the problems with me. Chelsea has a lot to bring to a team because of her teamwork, eye for design, understanding of user experience, and positive attitude.

Feedback from Matt:
Chelsea is awesome to work with. She's always in good spirits and bringing a welcome energy to the team. Working with her on our Weather/Redux project was really great. She's super reliable and always pulls through with the work she committed to, even going above and beyond. She made our app look great, and helped write important tests that lead to our project being a great success. Chelsea has a very skilled developer and one of the most enjoyable people to be around in our cohort. I hope we get to work together again soon!'

Feedback from Dale:
I was on the first group project of Mod3 with Chelsea.  The project was an enhanced weather application. This was second time I have worked with Chelsea and I know what she has to offer her team.  An area of strengthening in regards to this project was she seemed a little disengaged as compared to our previous project. It was our fist 'large' group project and I think we were all struggling to find a way to add to the team in a positive way.  Chelsea has great technical skills and is quick to get in and figure things out.  I have always liked working and learning with Chelsea.


#### remEMBER

Project Completion: 3 (10 issues closed)

Feedback from Kristen:
I have wanted to work with Chelsea since our first module, and it was so great to finally get that opportunity on the Ember project. Chelsea has such a positive attitude and exceptional communication skills, which were tremendously helpful for this project whose prime focus was a smooth workflow. Furthermore, I was out sick when my cohort was introduced to Ember, and Chelsea was able to get me up to speed and understanding the structure of an Ember app and our project in an hour over Sceenhero. Chelsea is great at debugging and problem solving, and I felt like between the two of us, we could work through any problem with little to no outside help.
My only constructive feedback is to not be afraid to call me (or anyone else) out when I'm being difficult or stubborn on working through a problem :) I truly hope we get to work together again in our final mod!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md]

I went to the Microaggressions 101 session because although I had heard the term before I wasn't sure how it was fully defined.
The session was useful in giving concrete and tangible examples of microaggressions that helped me be more aware of how different comments can be viewed and times when it may be appropriate to speak up. While I felt that I learned more about how to define and notice mircoagressions, the sessions did not address how to approach/address microaggressions so I would suggest having a follow-up session to address this.

### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown]

I appreciated this session because it linked back to a session last module on resilience and our group had given feedback that grit may be more applicable/appropriate to our situation. I think previous to this session I viewed grit as only the persistence piece as working/pushing through challenging times. The grit gear up helped me realize that grit is perserverance AND passion. This definition makes more sense to me and helps me understand why I can keep pushing myself through coding even when it is frustrating. I truly feel passionate about coding and it is one of the feel things I have done where I can get into a "flow" and lose myself in the work.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Turing Alumni Portfolio
* [https://www.turing.io/alumni/chelsea-skovgaard]

#### Pitch for Personal project
For my personal project, I proposed building an application that would allow users to search and browse movies. Users would then be able to save movies in their account and receive alerts when their saved movies were in theaters.

My initial steps for this project were investigating different APIs to use, creating wireframes for the application, and selecting the languages for the project. I created hand-drawn wireframes and selected React, React Router 4, Sass, Webpack, and Firebase based on my familiarity with the technologies and consulting with instructors.I selected The Movie Database API because it had good documentation, had a high limit for rate limit requests, and an API key was free and easily accessible.

After selecting the API, my initial steps were to see if I could access the API and display information. The step after this was hooking up firebase for users to save data. Having accomplished these two major steps, I continued the project by adding features and getting user feedback from friends, instructors, and classmates to improve the user experience.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Dale:
For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application together as a four person team. From this perspective, I think Hilary, Dale, and Matt did a great job working as a team ensuring that everyone had a chance to give input and to drive the project. Dale did a good job of trying to help step back and reflect at different stages of the project about next steps. One area of improvement could be taking more ownership/trying to work solo on the skills he may find challenging. I also really appreciated Dale's reflective/thoughtful approach when discussing strengths with him during our strengths finder exercise this module - he helped me better articulate and express my strengths.

To Hilary:
For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application together as a four person team. From this perspective, I think Hilary, Dale, and Matt did a great job working as a team ensuring that everyone had a chance to give input and to drive the project. I enjoyed working with Hilary again with this project. She is a quick learner, has a true passion for coding, and is willing to take risks and stretch herself. If there was an area for improvement, it would be to slow down or step away from a project when she is frustrated and then try working on the problem again.

To Matt:
For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application together as a four person team. From this perspective, I think Hilary, Dale, and Matt did a great job working as a team ensuring that everyone had a chance to give input and to drive the project. Although Matt figured out portions of the application individually, he was patient and open in explaining the process and working his teammates through these portions. He also figured out the local storage portion of the application. He is a great teammate - open in sharing his skills and thought process while also dependable in working individually to get his commitments completed.

To Kristen:
I really enjoyed finally getting to work with Kristen on a project! She is wicked smart and always upbeat. I think when pairing she achieves a good balance between driving and listening, which I appreciated in a project partner. She is also knowledgable about testing. Concepts I had not previously fully grasped she explained and helped me implement for my self-directed project. I enjoyed working with Kristen and hope I get the chance again. Can't wait for her to explain the stock show as well as she explains testing ;)

To Lucy:
In her second module, Lucy has again been a great member of the Verou posse. She is always engaged and active in discussions presented by other students. She also presented a Friday Spike again this module exploring data visualization further. Lucy is always willing to experiment and try new skills even if they are out of her expertise. I look forward to continuing to work with Lucy and seeing her continue to develop as a developer.

To Christine:
I am happy that Christine is part of the Turing Community. She has been an active participant in the Verou posse and helped contribute in planning a Friday Spike on data visualization this module. Not only do I appreciate her contributions to the posse, but she is a helpful and caring classmate. She is always willing to collaborate and problem solve. It's great working with Christine.

To Susi:
I was lucky enough the meet Susi during my first module at Turing during the Joan Clarke coffee mornings and in the Pahlka posse. I also have had the pleasure of interacting with her during Gear Ups and Lunch Roulette over the following modules. Susi is one of the most open, graceful, and kind-hearted people I have met. She can't help but make you smile when she talks. She made Turing feel welcoming and gave me confidence as a fellow female developer. I also appreciate how Susi always speaks her mind while being willing to listen. Susi is a wonderful colleague, friend, and developer who contributes to the community and inspires others.

To Laszlo:
Laszlo's genuine kidness is really hard to come by, Chelsea and I felt incredibly lucky to have him as a part of the Verou posse and to get to know him as a person. He is always willing to lend a helping hand and step up when needed to share his knowledge and perspective. When Chelsea and I asked for people to volunteer to give spikes during posse time Laszlo volunteered without hesitation. Not only are we happy to have had Laszlo as a part of the Verou Posse, but we look forward to continuing to get to know him as a developer and friend!

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Susi Irwin (1606-BE):
Chelsea - you are such a force at Turing. Getting to know you at JSC and Friday Guest Speakers has been a highlight of this module. Your positive attitude, eagerness to learn, and general kindness is truly what makes our community what it is. You are always there with words of encouragement, a hug when needed, a cup of the truth when that is needed as well. Chelsea, you are such an asset to the development world and I cannot wait to watch you take it by storm!

Feedback from Christine:
Chelsea continually contributes to the Turing community. She created and has led the Verou posse, which is great for both front-end and back-end students. I know leading a posse can be very time consuming, and she and Lacey have gone out of their way to make sure this posse is worthwhile for those who attend. We unfortunately did not have any projects together this mod, but we still collaborated and problem solved together often, which I really appreciated. Chelsea is becoming a great developer and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

Feedback from Laszlo Balogh (1610 BE):
Another module with the Verou Posse being under Chelsea's and Lacey's leadership. I enjoyed very much joining the weekly sessions. They provided great energy to bring together a large group to spread knowledge about front end related concepts and tools. Joining the Verou Posse from the Back End program the atmosphere was always welcoming and never for a second felt as an "outsider". They proved that they have what it takes to bring people together for collaboration. As they move to Mod4 and hand over leadership of the Verou Posse, their effort and contribution will be missed.

Feedback from Graham Nessler:
Great job running the posse for another mod! It's been a great part of the Turing community, and filled a real gap.

### Playing a Part

This module I continued leading the Verou on focused on design principles, data visualization, and developing FE skills. During Friday Spike, I co-led presentations on a variety of topics. Lastly, I actively participated in Joan Clarke Coffee Meetings, Lunch Roulette, and other community activities.
