Feedback from Christine:
Chelsea and I worked together on 2DoBox. She was a great partner to have. We clicked really well and flew through the project. Chelsea is very strong in her technical skills, but more importantly she approaches problems in a logical way. We started with the goal of taking an agile approach with this project, but for the most part we didn't create tests until the end. This could be an area for improvement in the future. The way Chelsea approaches code and her drive to deliver solid work will make her a great programmer.

#### Shoot the Breeze

* [https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/shootthebreeze]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html]

This application is a chat app where users can view messages of other users, submit messages, filter messages, and filter by user.

Feedback from Dale:
Chelsea was a powerful pair for our project.  She has a solid understanding of javascript and css with an amazing ability to get things done.  She was persistent with react and testing which really reflected well during our evaluation.  A possible area of strengthening would be a bit more communication about how she is approaching problem solving while pairing. I enjoyed working with her and I learned a lot in the process.

#### Fire-Bae

* [https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/fire-bae]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html]

This application is a supports betting app that is set up to pull in score and team data from an API. With the application, users can track their pending and completed wagers, submit wagers, and view a feed of the wins/losses of other users.

Evaluation Comments:
One monster function can be refactored, loved the amount of components, great tests would love to see more unit tests, breaking into like helper/regular functions, css animation

Feedback from Mike:
I really enjoyed working with Chelsea on Firebae. She was able to help us create an awesome wire frame for our app and help us visualize the direction we wanted to go! Chelsea kept the group positivity up while running into problems. Her strengths in styling helped me to become better at styling my own things.

Feedback from Alex:
Working with Chelsea on our pseudo-budget app was a great experience. Though our app proved somewhat difficult to take from ideation to execution I found Chelsea to be a very strong collaborator with many great ideas/opinions/perspective on designing our app/component architecture/design/you-name-it. Also Chelsea's bouncing basketball animation on the sign in page I think proved to be the best, well-functioning part of our app. Speaking for myself, I found it was somewhat hard to always know what our working priorities are, but I think that was the nature of working on an app unmoored by specifications as well as the difficulty of managing the mental energies of a three-person group. That being said, I would be happy to work with Chelsea on any future project :)

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]

I’m very interested in politics and being active in the political process. I thought the gear up was informative because it demonstrated how people could express differing views in a productive and respectful way. It also made me consider the sources for my news information and how much influence family and friends have on me. I also thought the discussion of rights v. responsibilities was useful and something that should be highlighted more in media and by politicians.

### Gear Up
#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown]

This session made me more conscious of the benefits that extroverts and introverts bring to teams. The information that introverts are better at incorporating all team members’ ideas and accepting the changes they suggest highlighted the importance of making sure that leaderships don’t always go to the loudest/most extroverted team members. It also highlighted for me the importance of making time for myself to reflect on material and make sure my need for some individual work time is mentioned in my DTRs and instructor feedback.

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown]

This session made me consider how resilience may be an innate attribute or something that is learned. I think through the discussion and articles I am more aware of how reframing a challenge or traumatic event can help one move past it. I think there is value in considering what is or is not under your control and viewing the event/issue through that lens. Resilience is still hard to achieve and will take continued training/efforts.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Finding Opportunities

* [https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/finding_opportunities.md]
* [https://trello.com/b/oHxf3zYK/company-tracker]

I came away with some good ideas of how to find opportunities. I have some ideas of where to search from remote jobs. I also learned how to use LinkedIn and Meetup to locate people to contact about opportunities and find people working at organizations I may be interested in.

#### Cold Outreach

* Completed Deliverable - sent email to set up coffee meeting

I came away with concrete ideas of how to craft an email to propose a coffee or google hangout meeting.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Christine:
I enjoyed working with Christine on 2ToBox. She is talented and knowledgable about testing and refactoring javascript. She is also fun to work with and keeps the work from getting too serious. We really clicked on working through technical problems together and it was one of the few projects where my partner and I got through the extensions, which was awesome! Honestly, I don’t have any big suggestions for improvement. The only thing I may have changed was working on tests earlier in the process.

To Dale:
Dale is methodical and thoughtful. I appreciated how he proposed and we enacted taking a step back from the project at the beginning to sketch out the project, consider how the different components would interact, and draw out the process. In other projects, my partners and I have dived into immediately coding and it was difficult to see the big picture and how the components would interact. Dale is also good at talking through processes, which help lead to a clearer understanding of concepts. It was also useful that we attempted to use agile practices - creating a component, designing, then testing. Although this became difficult to implement when we didn’t fully understand how to do testing in enzyme. One suggestion I have to Dale is to work on asking for help more often if needed. Since at times, it seemed he was hesitant to reach out for help.

To Mike:
I appreciated that Mike was straightforward and honest about his skills when we started working on our project. I know it probably isn't easy to say that you are working on some skill or feel weak on it. Knowing that Mike wanted to work on his React skills, Alex and I pushed him to drive/type during the beginning of the project. I think Mike may have gotten annoyed by this after a while but he toughed it out. I thought he showed great ownership of the testing portion of the app and took steps to problem solve when issues arose. Mike was also really fun to work with on this project - I don't think I have laughed so much during a project.

To Alex:
I enjoyed being able to work with Alex on our budget/betting app. I don't think I'm a great risk taker. Alex's passion and risk taking drive are admirable and pushed me out of my comfort zone on this project. Alex's idea to do a betting app allowed our group to flex our skills, work on challenging problems, and try new ways of thinking. Alex is hilarious and always willing to listen to other people on the team's ideas. This was my first time in a group of three so I think it was a little difficult to know what each of us was working on, how to divide work and what our next steps should be. So I think we could have used more organization of our tasks. Overall, I had a great experience working with Alex, would love to collaborate on another project, and work to refine our app.

To Kristen:
When starting the Verou Posse, we joked that Kristen would be our "community liaison". But it was no joke. From bringing cookies to a posse meeting to volunteering to lead a posse lunch and Friday Spike, Kristen has been a great posse member and community participant. She also asks great questions during posse presentations and always has a positive and cheerful attitude. We are so happy that she joined our posse!

To Lucy:
Lucy has one of the most dynamic, go-getter personalities we've had the pleasure to meet at Turing. We felt incredibly lucky to have her as a part of the Lea Verou Posse. She volunteered to lead sessions, always showed up ready to learn something new, was willing to share her skill-set with the rest of the group, and even came up with a killer proposal to do a Design Hackathon. Overall, we were both super impressed with  not only her attitude, but her desire to be a part of the Turing community. We look forward to getting to know Lucy more, and seeing all the great things she does here at Turing and in life!

To Lacey:
Lacey was an awesome co-posse lead. I couldn't have co-started the posse without her. She was always feeling to step us to lead presentations, take notes, and organize posse meetings. Starting a posse did feel a little daunting, but co-leading with Lacey made it doable and fun. I look forward to our posse adventures next mod!

To Hilary:
I had the opportunity to work with Hilary on Weatherly. Being the first React project, it was difficult and challenging. I admire how Hilary is willing to dive right into a project. We worked through challenges effectively and learned a lot during the project. Hilary has been a great SAB rep - she's been great at communicating information and listening to feedback.

### Being a Community Member

From Lacey:
Everyday I am more and more impressed by Chelsea's interest in the community. I feel so lucky that she was willing to not only spearhead the design posse, but allow me to run it with her. It was a great experience, and I think it was a subject that was severely lacking from our Posse selection, so it was exiting that so many people were so interested. I'm looking forward to refining the classes and direction of the Lea Verou Posse in the Mods to come and couldn't ask for a better partner!

From Laszlo Balogh (1610BE):
Both Chelsea and Lacey bring special energy to the Verou Posse that makes it special. The topics selected on a weekly basis are very interesting, they both do an excellent job to manage the flow of the meeting to make sure the presentation is completed, all questions are answered and still finished within the allocated time. I very much appreciate their effort and Verou Posse will be at the top of my list next Mod. Thank you.

From Graham:
Lacey and Chelsea, great job with the Verou posse! You really stepped up and created something that has attracted great interest in the Turing community. I've really enjoyed being a part of this posse, and I look forward to our activities in the future. Kudos!

From Lauren Pesce (1610FE):
Lacey and Chelsea - You two are truly incredible! The Verou posse was always something to look forward to during my first mod at Turing. Your lessons were well thought out and I was so impressed to see a big push to include back-end students in a group that was so based in design. I think it was a great idea to focus on our personal websites as an ongoing project - it was something everyone could work on and learn from. You were both always so positive and it was apparent that you have a great understanding of front-end lessons as well as design related subjects.

### Playing a Part

This module I co-founded/started a new posse on focused on design principles, data visualization, and developing FE skills. One week during Friday Spike, I presented a workshop on animating SVGs. Additionally, I co-led several posse lunches and Friday Spikes. I also took the opportunity to pair with other students on topics they needed help on. I also actively participated in Productivity Lunch, Joan Clarke Coffee Meetings, Lunch Roulette, and other community activities.
