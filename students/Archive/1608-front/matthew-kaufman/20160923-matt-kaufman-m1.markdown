# Matt Kaufman - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I set out to hopefully find a passion for web software development, which I have found. I have hoped to find work in which I'm consistently focused and working in a "flow state", neither bored nor frustrated but able to work efficiently and happily. I've truly enjoyed helping others learn the material, as well. I love commuting via Bike to Turing every day.

(description)
### Assignment:

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project.

### About Phlying Phish:

The game we made was inspired by the flash classic "Helicopter Game" and more recently, "Flappy Bird". The objective is to keep the fish moving along without hitting any obstacles, and in the process, gain as many points as possible. Hitting the mushrooms will also give extra points as well as start a "rainbow mode" in which the world turns to rainbows and Phish jams out.

# JavaScript Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

# Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## Feedback to me

### Ian Lancaster (Partner for Gametime)

It was a lot of fun to work with Matt on Game Time. I was astounded at how quickly he could write code, diagnose problems, and get things working. There were many instances where we worked together in an effective and collaborative manner. That said, I frequently felt that I was just an observer of this project rather than a partner. The vast majority of the code written by Matt when we were together, and a lot more of it he wrote on his own. I will be spending a good portion of the interim period building a game of my own to ensure that I fully understand the concepts of the project.

## Feedback to Me

### Alex Pilewski (Partner for IdeaBox)

Matt was a fantastic partner on ideaBox. From day one we were able to hit the ground running and had a good rapport knocking out the specs of the project. He is a supremely diligent worker and is very gracious with his time. His work on the extensions impressed me and I would be very happy to work with him again in the future.

# Feedback To Me

### Ryan Westlake (Partner for Number Guesser)

Working with Matt was a good experience. As it was our class’ first project, his knowledge and experience was greater than mine, and yet I felt like I fully contributed. We both had a chance to “drive” and work through the code. The final product was nice.

He was open to different approaches and my ideas. If you have JS questions, you can probably ask Matt :slightly_smiling_face:.

He’s also cool.

# E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

#### Feedback for Ryan:

Ryan was a pleasure to work with. He was well organized, positive and design-oriented.
He did a great job making our Number Guesser look great and we did almost the entire project together.
While I may have been a bit further ahead with Javascript, he showed real effort towards making sure he understood all the concepts and even did the project entirely on his own separately. Ryan shows great initiative towards his own learning and is totally dedicated to his craft. I'd love to work with Ryan again, he's very thoughtful, friendly, and great to get along with - the perfect team member.

#### Feedback for Alex:

Working with Alex on IdeaBox was a pleasure. He has a good knowledge of Javascript and is engaging to work with. Alex focuses well, was always on time, and overall super friendly. Our project went smoothly, we had good communication, and he helped me understand more git concepts that I didn't know before. I hope to work with Alex again in the future.

#### Feedback for Ian:

Ian is super organized and a great team member. I learned a ton of cool workflow hacks from him. He knows his keyboard shortcuts and crushes productivity. Ian plans well, and I learned a lot from his up-front planning attitude, even if we diverged from the plans at some point during the project. Ian was really fun to work with and we had a great time working on our game. I'd love to have Ian on a team again in the future.

#### Feedback for Lacey:

Lacey is awesome. As a graphic designer, she knows how to make things look really damn good - and she's always giving others suggestions for design tools to use. She is great to have real, meaningful and positive conversations with, and overall a pleasure to be around. I wish I had gotten to work on a project with Lacey this module. She has a good knowledge of the class material and shows real dedication to the program. I'm looking forward to working with Lacey more and hopefully picking up some of her design chops.

## Being a Community Member

### Feedback from others

#### Graham

Matt really went above and beyond to help others. Due to his prior programming knowledge and background, he was at a more advanced place than most or all others in the class, and he consistently made himself available to assist others. He is a real asset to the cohort and I look forward to working with him next module.

#### Gabi

Matt has been an amazing teammate and a great resource for when you need help talking through a problem in your code.  Matt is always eager to help another member of the cohort, and also has made efforts to get the cohort together for extracurricular activities.   I've always seen Matt as a truly supportive and vital member of our cohort, and I'm glad to have him around. Thanks for all of your help, Matt!

#### Lacey

Matt is an incredibly bright person, but his humble nature is really what makes him stand out in our community. He is always willing to drop whatever he is doing to help others, and truly wants to see every one in the program succeed. He also has a genuinely positive attitude which is evident in our group retros and in his conversations with others. Overall, Matt adds a great dynamic to our community and I’m excited to see him continue to grow in this program!

#### Maia

Matt is a brilliant member of our cohort!  He clearly has the background to be able to pick up the concepts very quickly, but what I really love is his gentle and humble nature, and willingness to jump in and help whenever he is able.  I feel like I can count on him and we haven't even had the opportunity to partner on a project.  He's always there with a supportive and encouraging word, and is definitely willing to jump into anyone's code and work through a challenge.  I look forward to working with him, learning with and from him, and watching what he creates at Turing.

### Playing a Part

I think I help others with their code quite often. I like to help people and get better at debugging in the process. Being a part of the turing community is very important to me and participating in events and community building activities is very important to me. Next module, I'd like to spend more time building community outside of the classroom and help work towards the greater turing mission of getting a greater amount of people into the software industry.
