# Matt Kaufman - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

For this mod my main goal was to get much better at collaboration with my team mates and working on projects together. I think I accomplished this very well and improved my code explaining skills along with pairing with lots of mod 1 students along the way. I think my development skills have improved along with my workflow. I love helping people and teaching others code.

### Assignment:

## A Nimble Network

Networking is a critical skill, and it can get hard to keep track of everyone you meet when you’re getting established in a new industry. Build an app to help you organize all your contacts and, hey, maybe even do a little job stalking while you’re at it. As a user, I want a networking app that:

At a minimum, allows me to record name, company, email, social media, and phone number of new contacts.
Ideally, I can also add an image (like logo, avatar, biz card snap)
Includes a toggle on/off “followup” indicator on each contact, which will save those contacts in a “followup” list for my quick reference
Permits multiple options for email, phone, and social media, and allows me to specify “primary” where applicable.
Includes an option note field for each contact, so that I can write myself little reminders about how we met, and what we discussed.

### About Netwerker:

Netwerker is an app to add contacts and save all the information related to them, including uploading a picture to firebase.

## Description

Do you remember that project Ideabox?

We thought they were pretty great, but, I think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox. Your projects will utilize webpack & it’s awesome development server. Keeping accessibility in mind we will be grading you based on how accessible your application is. Lastly you will implement feature tests using selenium webdriver.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up Reflections

#### Civic Duty -

#Curriculum for a high school civics class

The class should cover basic topics about voting, why voting is important, and how exercising that right leads to a greater benefit for the whole community. I would demonstrate what happens in our current situation where the citizens don't participate as much as other countries, and how the way the government functions reflects that.

Since citizens can receive benefits from the policy enacted by the government, they should be required to actively participate.



#### Reflection Questions
* Are there organizations that you trust to gather information about candidates or whose endorsements you value? If you don't know, how could you find out?

* politifact is a great resource. I value major journalism endorsements, such as the new york times. The internet may provide lots of good resources, but it's sometimes difficult to check for facts. It's good to use as many sources as possible to find out who really is speaking truth backed by scientific evidence, not just words made up for some alterior purpose or to serve some group.

* Step back and reflect on how your opinion of candidates are shaped. What are your primary sources for gathering an impression of candidates? Reflect on whether and how these sources help you pick candidates most aligned to your goals and values.

* this primary source for me is the candidate themselves. When they speak, how they speak and what kind of thoughts/feelings they inspire. Trustworthiness is hugely important. Also to gather an impression, I'll check out the actual policy goals they want to enact. Do they have a plan, backed with details? Or is it just meaningless words with nothing to back it up with.

* If you dedicate 10 hours before every election to make an informed decision, what would be the best way to use it? For example: Watching the news, reading a voter guide, consulting endorsements from trusted organizations, seeing a candidate speak, etc.

* the best way would NOT be to watch the news. Reading their policy plans, watching them speak for 30 minutes, and checking fact checkers for how consistent their words are would be good resources. Consulting family and friends who I trust as well, would be a good use of my time.

#### Introversion


#Introversion

1. Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What were the benefits and challenges of the styles?
  * Definitely. Most of my work as an engineer was with mostly introverts. Most of the engineers would put their heads down     and do the work without raising much of an opinion. When the leader was more of an introvert, the engineers were more vocal    and proactive in getting their opinions known.
2. How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of introverts? How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of extroverts?
  * Introvert Strengths: Attention to detail, patience, and a quiet reflection to understand themselves.
  * Introvert Weaknesses: Difficulty getting their ideas out in the open.
  * Extrovert Strength: Making friends, having strong social connections
  * Extrovert Weaknesses: May not fully understand themselves or how they are.

3. How can you leverage the strengths of introverts and extroverts in your future projects and future career?

  * Balancing a team correctly with a leader who best fits the needs of the personality types of the team. It's important to establish expectations and get personality types out in the open in the beginning.

4. Do you think our current approaches to group activities at Turing are sufficiently accommodating to introverted personalities? Reflect on how we could reshape team and group activities (pairings, team retros, cohort retros) to create an environment in which introverts’ and extroverts strengths are equally supported.

  * I think extroverts strengths are definitely more supported at Turing. In group projects, it's usually encouraged to pair together and work together. Introverts seem to require more time alone without being in a social setting to contemplate and figure out how things work. Having some more individual projects balanced with the group projects would be a good idea.


#### Resilience


When you first read the title of this GearUp, what were your initial reactions? What experiences have you had that shaped your attitude toward the topic?

- I first thought the title of resilience referred to how difficult Turing can be for many people and how resilience can be culfivated. I've had experiences in college in regards to my engineering major that cultivated resilience as far as learning difficult things on my own.


What did you learn from reading the article? Did this change or affirm any attitudes and beliefs you hold?

- I learned that a lot of people who face resilience early in life either grow up with a bunch of issues or end up becoming super resilient to change as they grow up, and become better for it.

What value do you put on personal resilience? Why?

- I think resilience is extremely valuable. Learning and experiencing struggle puts many things into perspective and can improve response to external change. When someone struggles through difficult times, once the stress is reduced, everything becomes a bit easier. Its all about perspective and where people have come from to determine where they go in their new situations.

Consider Josh Spodek's premise that knowing about resilience is different than becoming more resilient. Identify 3 mental practices and behaviors that constitute resilience skills.

- Being mindful. When external stressors exist, identifying them and responding in a calm/collected manner is important.
- Dealing with stress in a healthy way instead of unhealthy. Making choices to exercise or be social when stressed is much better than using stress as a trigger to drink or engage in destructive behavior.
- Being positive and maintaining an internal locus of control. When you understand that good or bad things happen to you no matter what and that you are the sole person that determines how you react to them, things tend to become less stressful and you become more resilient.

#### Cold Email


Hi Lovisa,

I'm in the Front-end program (mod 2) and reaching out because I've heard/read great things about CA Technologies. It grabbed my attention when I saw a couple of your reviews posted on Built in Colorado and it srikes me like a wonderful place to learn and grown as a new developer.

I'd love to meet you and learn more about what your experience has been at CA, and see if it could be a good fit when I graduate in March. Might you be available for coffee at Little Owl Thursday afternoon at 4:15?

By the way, I was the one who purchased the Chemex/Teapot from Trey and it's been treating me super nicely, so thank you for giving it up!

Matt


# E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Maia:
I love having you around Maia! You keep the instructors true and on their toes by asking the questions that everyone is thinking but might not want to say. You are super valuable to our cohort as an active voice and also having really awesome knowledge outside programming. I really enjoy working with you and you have a really good heart - thank you for always being around and active in our community


#### Lacey:


Matt Kaufman	[7:45 PM]  
For Shoot the Breeze - Lacey was awesome to work with for shoot the breeze. It's not necessary to state, but she's the master of design. Even though we didn't have to actually design the project ourselves, she helped me learn some awesome css tricks and tips that I didn't know before. Lacey is a hard worker, an extremely reliable team member and just generally a pleasure to be around. I hope we can work on more projects together down the road, she is a super valuable asset to any team!

## Being a Community Member

### Feedback from others


### Dan Grund

Matt, thank you so much for taking time out of your lunches and after class to pair with my partners and I. your patience, understanding, and explanatory practices are top notch. Keep doing what you're doing.


### Chelle

Matt was an exceptional help in pairings. He insisted I find the answer on my own, yet furnished guidance in helping me on my way. Additionally, he provided a sense of self-confidence in areas where I was saw I was lacking. I would recommend Matt's approach to anyone seeking further clarity in programming. His knowledge of the subject is unsurpassed.


### Mike L

You have been incredibly helpful. You've given a lot of time to helping us in Mod 1 and we are all better because of it. I especially appreciate you pushing me to keep at something because "the solution isn't as far away as it seems".

My only critical feedback would be to read your audience and slow down at times when it seems that the person/group your helping isn't keeping up. Other than that, keep up the great work, thanks for all the help!

### Elijah Williams

Matt, I paired with you twice during Module 1. Your help was greatly appreciated on both occasions. I think you did a good job of guiding, not giving, during the pairing sessions. I have nothing critical to provide, just wanted to say thanks.

### Kinan

Time after time, Matt has been a huge helping hand for picking out the bugs in my program and for optimizing my software methodology. He has been the overall odds and ends go-to in our mod and has largely participated in helping countless students out with working through logic. Matt has some experience prior to Turing working with software and databases, and for this reason he has been immensely helpful. Our strengths are often times our greatest weaknesses as well, and if there was anything he could improve on it would be slowing down at points and just giving the attention to one group instead of being pulled to others, bouncing back and forth between the two and his phone sometimes. If he is able to focus on one group at a time, that would be ideal, but I also see the benefit of giving a bit here and then over there at the same time. I would also recommend not consistently pairing with 1 person or group over and over again. You're too valuable to the whole of the front-end to just spend time with a select few, even if that's what their preference is! Great work overall, Matt. I am deeply appreciative of the assistance I get from you.

### Sam J

I really appreciated your time this Mod, Matt. You were very patient, helpful and solution oriented during out time pairing together and it helped me get through a lot of the bigger issues/questions I was working through. I know that a lot of other people in 1610 see you as the go-to guy for pairing as well because of this. Cheers!

### Steph

I really appreciated your help with Game Time. In an incredibly short amount of time, you were able to help us properly link our bullets to the rest of the game, separate them into distinct bullets, and refactor them. Also, you were able to describe the code in English, not just javascript, which was really helpful for my comprehension. Also, I was hesitant about staying in Pahlka because as a mod1 student/beginner I wasn't sure what I could offer, but you mentioning the possibility of plugging the gametime project into Pahlka's game and even just the simple task of finding an image for anther game helped me feel better about coming to the spike sessions- so thanks for that!

### Graham

Matt and I worked together in a group of three with Christine on Netwerker, our capstone project for the module. By this time, Matt had acquired a reputation for being the most advanced student in our cohort, and I entered the project hoping to learn a lot from him. He didn't disappoint; I really did learn a great deal during our two weeks working on the project. He encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone and learn more effective ways of writing code. Matt also spent a lot of time helping fellow students in our mod and in 1610, which speaks to his character and to the camaraderie that Turing cultivates.

### Maia

It was wonderful to start of the mod pairing with you, Matt! It was great to see how your brain works, and be able to complete the project specs with ease. I thought our workflow was great, but my suggestion would be to be more of a teacher on your paired projects, and take on some side projects of your own, to continue to challenge yourself. It's both refreshing and frustrating that you are able to go home and complete large pieces of the project. I saw you helping a ton of people this mod, so that's wonderful! You are a leader in our program, and inspire me to push harder to learn more. Thank you for always being willing to jump into my (and anyone's) code and help solve problems.


#### Lacey:

Feeback for Shoot the Breeze --
I really enjoyed working with Matt on our Shoot the Breeze project. He made it clear in the beginning of the project that he wanted to personally work on letting go of the reigns on a project and really empower the other people in the group to contribute and at the very least, take over all of the typing. I think he was really successful in this, and made great strides in personal growth during this project. Some areas of improvement for Matt would be to simplify. I think he is incredibly smart, and the next step for him in his path is a developer is to perform the complex tasks he can do in a more simplified way. Overall though, my favorite part of working with Matt is his optimism and his desire to see every one in the group succeed. Thanks, Matt!

### Notes

Make it easy for people, when you're working together, to say 'no, I don't get it'. 

Keep going down rabbit holes - Taylor

Get your ass kicked a little bit. Trying pairing in rails. Do some open source. Put yourself in situations where you aren't the best dev in the room. Try to work with Lacey. Contribute to exercism. - Meeka

You're doing _great_ work in focusing on pairing. You bring a lot to the cohort and I'm so proud of the strides that you've made. - Jhun
