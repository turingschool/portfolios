# (Matt Kaufman) - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

This mod I really hoped to improve my collaboration skills and expand my development knowledge into back-end territory. I feel like I've grown a lot this module, becoming more of a master of my tools, relying less on examples and more on my own ability to code.

## A: End of Module Assessment


## Rubric
### Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application includes all of the major functionality. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


### Determining the right tools for the job
- 4 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them

### Following Documentation
- 4 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Did not need instructor guidance on how to work with the endpoints.

#### Dale

I was on the first group project of Mod3 with Matt. The project was an enhanced weather application. This was the first time I have worked with him. An area that I think could be strengthened for Matt is bit more self awareness in group problem solving sessions. My sense is that he can come across a bit forceful in some situations.  I believe that is not his intention and more a reflection of his intensity when working to solve a problem. That said, I found him open to discussion and willing to try other’s suggestions and approaches. He was also quick to praise his teammates when things worked out. He is the strongest technically of anyone that I worked with in the cohort. I learned a great deal from Matt and really enjoyed working with him.  I believe he would be an excellent intern/teaching assistant for Turing when he completes the program if he applies.

#### Chelsea

For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application together as a four person team. From this perspective, I think Hilary, Dale, and Matt did a great job working as a team ensuring that everyone had a chance to give input and to drive the project. Although Matt figured out portions of the application individually, he was patient and open in explaining the process and working his teammates through these portions. He also figured out the local storage portion of the application. He is a great teammate - open in sharing his skills and thought process while also dependable in working individually to get his commitments completed.

#### Hilary

t was great working with Matt on my first Redux project because he had a really good working knowledge on how Redux worked. He had the idea to work on the entire project together and it ended up being the best group project experience I have had yet because I learned the most from working on each problem together. We collaborated and shared ideas very well but I would suggest that Matt takes into considerations others ideas and potentially allowing implementation of those ideas more often. Matt did very well at leading the group and making sure each of us knew every single line of code he developed on his own. Matt has a lot to offer a company considering he is a good teacher, leader, teammate, and hard worker.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [GitHub URL]()

As you head into the homestretch of your time at Turing and begin to look toward your job search, it will be helpful to begin to articulate the things that, in Hilmantel's words, you can find "enduringly fascinating."

What parts of your experience at Turing has lit that fire?

  - Turing has provided and perpetuated the idea that even when a concept seems difficult, it is 100% achievable.
  - Being around social justice "do good work" minded people, my passion for code has dramatically increased.

Brainstorm 4-5 descriptions of work that really engages you (algorithmically complex challenges, imagining user needs and creating something elegant and enjoyable to use, designing backend architecture to support open-ended specification).

  - Projects that ultimately create joyful experiences
  - Working with the end user needs in mind and helping them solve a practical problem
  - Helping bring education and justice for under-represented groups
  - Working with people I enjoy spending time with
  - Creating elegant solutions to challenging problems


How can you create opportunities to build around the work that engages you in your remaining time at Turing?

  - Make connections with people I like and that share a similar vision with myself.
  - Give back to Turing to help solve internal problems and create a better student experience, ultimately learning a lot and giving back in the process.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Chelsea:

Chelsea is awesome to work with. She's always in good spirits and bringing a welcome energy to the team. Working with her on our Weather/Redux project was really great. She's super reliable and always pulls through with the work she committed to, even going above and beyond. She made our app look great, and helped write important tests that lead to our project being a great success. Chelsea has a very skilled developer and one of the most enjoyable people to be around in our cohort. I hope we get to work together again soon!

#### Dale:
Dale is one of the most enjoyable team members I've ever worked with. He's always in high spirits, ready and able to always work hard to get the best results possible. Coming from an organizational background, his drive to help manage the team's tasks and keep us on track was a huge benefit. I personally struggle with staying organized, but with Dale's direction I felt like I could let go of the reigns and focus on the task at hand. He asks great questions, and has insight into the whole scope of the project that is very impressive. Working with Dale is pleasent, as he's always on time and on schedule...an incredibly reliable teammate. I love working with Dale and I think he's an extremely valuable teammate in all respects.

#### Hilary:
Hilary is a really great team member. She's assertive, involved and dedicated to the success of the project. Working with her on WeatherDux was really fun, since we did the whole project as a group. Her involvement made me grow as a developer, because she's such a great communicator. Because of that, she helped me to improve my explaining skills. Hilary works hard, is very reliable and pulls her weight as a team member. I look forward to working with Hilary again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

#### Ali:

This module Matt did a great job taking over leadership for some of the Pahlka content. We restructured how our Friday Spike sessions worked and Matt took on leading a couple of these sessions without hesitation. As a backend student, I greatly appreciated the exposure to frontend development tools and workflow. Matt has been a regular presence in our posse community. I greatly appreciate his dedication and commitment to our project and the group as a whole.
