-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluator: Nathanial

###### Spec Adherence

* 3 - The application includes all of the major functionality. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###### Determining the right tools for the job

* 3 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not utilize them as efficiently as possible; demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used.

###### Following Documentation

* 4 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Did not need instructor guidance on how to work with the endpoints.


## B: Group Projects

#### Weather Forecast
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrewLcrist/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

#### Instructor: Brittany

Comments:

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Redux Architecture

4 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
Workflow

3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.
Troubleshooting

4 - Most to all questions were posed to instructors with expected information

###### Feedback:

Christine: I worked with Andrew on the weather forecast project. There was some initial animosity. Andrew mocked the way I pronounce “button”, “mountain”, and other words with “t”. I think he is still bitter that the Cubs won the World Series. Seriously though, Andrew is a really hard worker and a great developer, and this was helpful for our project. One thing I’ve noticed about Andrew is whenever I’m stuck on something and ask for help in Slack or in class, he is one of the first to offer help, and that is a quality that will take him far.

### C: Personal Projects

#### Movie Keeper

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrewLcrist/movie-keeper)

Pivot 2DoBox from one of our Mod 1 IdeaBox. 2DoBox utilized webpack and selenium testing.

#### Instructor: Brenna

#### Feature Delivery

##### 1. Completion

4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

##### 2. Organization

3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

#### Technical Quality

##### 1. Test-Driven Development

// PENDING TESTS 1: Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage).

##### 2. Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

#### Product Experience

##### 1. User Experience

3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

##### 2. Performance

3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

###### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

###### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

###### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Gear Up

######  Grit

I appreciated this gear up because it spoke to something that I feel like I was naturally born with, however, in our discussions, I realized that what I considered to my grit may actually be circumstantial grit. I think grit is being able to stick with something despite your decision to be in that situation. I able able to exhibit grit in these circumstances, but my endurance is also fed by my desire to find myself in different circumstances where grit isn't necessary. Is this grit?

### Professional Development

I worked extensively this mod to improve my resume. I have a lot of work to do on my LinkedIn. I also did some cold outreach to seven companies and have begun applying for jobs.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I participated in community via collaborating with my peers when requiring or providing help with code.

Most proudly, I was excited to see that ironFE, a group I cofounded in Mod2, took off and grew this mod. I cannot take responsibility for this though. The reason this really took off was Taylor. He commited his personal time to ensure that we're prepped for interviews. As easy a time I have giving Taylor a hard time, his worth at Turing is invaluable.

## Final Review

### Notes
Stop being so much like Taylor before he took a mod off. 

### Outcome
Pass
