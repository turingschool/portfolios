## A: End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluator: Meeka

###### Notes:
Work on Codewars or Exercism problems. Quit drawing the owl. Stop more often and just poke the code to see what it is and confirm that it's working. Liberally use debugger, wrapper.debug(), console.log(), if('something'){ console.log() }, eval(locus).

###### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

###### Workflow

- workflow is also great.

###### Specification Adherence

3 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing * 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

###### Accessibility

3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0 - 3 aXe-core violations.

###### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

###### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

###### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

###### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

###### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

2 - Six to ten complaints

###### Design

4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

###### Feedback

Lacey: Andrew was a great partner for Shoot the Breeze. He brought a great dynamic to the group, and his positivity and humor really kept the group going when we felt like giving up. He's also a very adept developer, and I appreciated his ability to take a step back and ask questions if he didn't fully understand something, and his desire to learn and try all aspects of the project. I think one area for improvement for Andrew would be confidence. I think he has a lot of talent that he doesn't give himself credit for. Overall, he was a fantastic contributor to the team and I look forward to working with him again in the future!

#### Budget App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/BudgetApp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

Budget App was written using React Native and testing was done using Jest. This project pushed us to learn a new framework and testing suite that we had not been taught in class.

#### Instructor: Jhun

###### Feedback

Gabi: Andrew follows the ideas and thought processes of others with ease. He possesses great communication skills and does an excellent job with team workflow. During our time spent on Firebae, I appreciated that he would take the time to whiteboard concepts that we were finding difficulty with. Something that Andrew might benefit from could be improving his project time management by working in short sprints (Pomodoro system) versus long, drawn out intervals of work time.  Thanks for being a great partner, Andrew!

Ryan: I really enjoyed working with Andrew on our final Mod2 project (PennyWise). This is the second project I’ve had with him and continue to be impressed with his abilities. I appreciated his willingness to take on risk, grit, and leadership. When I was floundering while trying to set up a plan and design our app, he led the charge and set us on a much better path. He also brings a lighthearted nature to the group, allowing us to enjoy ourselves while dealing with difficult situations. Our personalities and abilities complement each other, and I would gladly work well with him again. My advice for how he can grow and improve is: Get more and more comfortable with syntax. It just takes repetition. Over the course of two weeks, it will save hours in time.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

######  Vote Your Conscience

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I appreciated this gear-up and the neutrality of the conversations that were being encouraged. The fact that Turing found it important to generate these conversations is really admirable.

######  Introversion
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I thought this session was really important to understanding one another's strengths and how to utilize them during a group project.

######  Resilience

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This session felt more theoretical than any of the other sessions. Though resilience is said to be teachable, I'm not really sure that it really is teachable. To me, resilience is based on circumstance and one's decision to be resilient. What that looks like to each person is different. I think, if it is 'teachable', that it is more inherited via example than any sort of traditional teaching method.

I'm excited to continue refining my resume and begin the application process in Mod 3.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

It was fantastic working with Lacey on Shoot the Breeze. She has a calm approach that is very productive, including times when facing specifically stressful problems. Shoot the Breeze was a challenge of logic and required us to write code in a new language and Lacey met it head-on. If something wasn’t clear to Lacey, or if she detected it might not be clear to me, she readily stopped coding to ensure understanding of the process. When it comes to testing and styling, Lacey is unmatched in my opinion. She is a patient teacher and really values the collective knowledge and learning of the group. If I’m forced to give Lacey constructive criticism, it would revolve around her confidence when she feels she has a solution to a problem, but doesn’t speak up. I noticed this hesitance only a couple of times and don’t think it hurt our progress, but I am aware of my own value of Lacey’s opinions and readily welcome any direction she might provide to a project.

Working with Gabi on Budget App was a great experience. Gabi is quick to begin tackling a new problem and is not daunted by any challenge. We were already working with a framework we had not been taught and this was compounded by working with a testing suite we weren’t familiar with either. Gabi led the charge on figuring out how to test and spent countless hours trying to fulfill our testing requirements. Additionally, despite personal circumstances that were without a doubt very distracting to her, Gabi maintained constant communication, professionalism, and maintained availability to continue work on the project. All things that I would not have expected of anyone considering the circumstances. I could dig deep to provide constructive criticism for Gabi, but it would be forced and done so unnecessarily.

This is my second project with Ryan. Again, he is a go-getter. His organization and goals make being on a team with him very easy. For our Budget App, he wanted to write our code using React Native. He led the charge on figuring out how Native works and worked to ensure Gabi and I understood what we were doing initially. With any entrepreneur, I think Ryan would benefit from slowing down, just a bit sometimes in order to show that he’s still human. His strength almost, only almost, presents itself as a weakness in group projects. I’m ready to work with him again in Mod 3.
