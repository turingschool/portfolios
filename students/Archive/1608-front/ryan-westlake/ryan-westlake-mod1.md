# Ryan Westlake - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

When I started at Turing and began Module 1, I had the following goals: 

1. Learn to write beautiful and efficient HTML
2. Begin to understand what it takes to build "delightful" web pages (CSS)
3. Understand foundational Javascript principles. This means a robust understanding of the structure and purpose of the main functions.
4. Get involved with the Bezos posse.

My "Aim High" Goals Were and Remain:

1. Be the *#1* frontend developer to come out of the Turing program
1. Build a MVP to test for a startup idea.

I came into the program with minimal coding experience and was a bit concerned about my ability to absorb and keep up. Steve's talk on the first day was helpful to set expectations. I can honestly say that the first module was an incredible experience. If you would have told me that I would build a fully-functioned 2048 game over 1.5 weeks after only learning about OO three weeks earlier, I wouldn't have believed it. My knowledge of HTML and CSS are certainly greater and I understand foundational JS principles. I am excited to learn about building more advanced web applications.

For the "not-as-positive", I can also say that my knowledge of JS is not where I want it to be. I made it, but want it to be far stronger.

## A: End of Module Assessment

###Notes:

Solid understanding of Javascript, a pleasure to pair with. Picks up on very slight suggestions and runs with it, takes direction and collaborates very well, and understands what each line of his code is doing. He is harder on himself than he needs to be, and I encouraged him to be kind to himself. Well done!

####Progression/Completion

	3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

####JavaScript Style

	3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

####Workflow

	3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

####Collaboration
	
	4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The primary individual project I had was Color Changer. It was not graded, so don't have scores. However, the links are above. I added an "extension" to change the look.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I enjoyed the Mod 1 projects. They were all stretching and had moments of "how in the world am I going to do this?" It's amazing how much we accomplished is such a short amount of time. 

#### Number Guesser ---- Project

* [Live URL](https://rcwestlake.github.io/number-guesser-rw/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first major project. I worked with a student who already had a strong understanding of programming and really enjoyed the process. It was the first time I had done a pair project and it was helpful to gain the workflow and problem solving skills. After completing it with my partner, I went back and built it myself for more practice. 

#####Evalution

Functional Expectations

	4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

Fundamental JavaScript Style

	3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


#####Feedback from My Partner -- Matt
Ryan was a pleasure to work with. He was well organized, positive and design-oriented.
He did a great job making our Number Guesser look great and we did almost the entire project together.

While I may have been a bit further ahead with Javascript, he showed real effort towards making sure he understood all the concepts and even did the project entirely on his own separately. Ryan shows great initiative towards his own learning and is totally dedicated to his craft. I'd love to work with Ryan again, he's very thoughtful, friendly, and great to get along with - the perfect team member.


#### Linked Lists ---- Project

* [Live URL](https://rcwestlake.github.io/linked-lists/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)


#####Evalution

Functional Expectations

	4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
	
HTML Style

	3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
	
CSS Style

	4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
	
Fundamental JavaScript Style

	3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
	
Workflow

	4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
	
#####Evaluation Notes	

Super clear that both parties touched all parts of the code. Design decisions were all very intentional and devs can speak to why they chose to make css decisions they did.



#####Feedback from My Partner -- Chelsea

Working on linked list with Ryan was a good experience, I think he does a good job of thinking through a problem and searching for solutions through google and resources. He works on a problem for a while and then reaches out for help when needed. He was also open to switching driving the program, which was helpful for my learning style.

#### Ideabox --- Project

This is was the hardest project we had (before Gametime). We took a deep dive into object orientated programming and local storage.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)


#####Evalution

Specification Adherence

	3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

	4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

JavaScript Style

	3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

	4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#####Feedback from My Partner -- Andrew


IdeaBox was a challenge exponentially more difficult compared to our previous projects - Ryan wasn’t daunted. He is packed with a drive toward success, a drive that is contagious and provides a healthy energy that fueled us through the problems we encountered. He has a quick mind for catching syntax errors, absorbing problems, and can effortlessly verbalize possible solutions to a problem. It’s easily apparent that Ryan’s education extends further than the classroom as a handful of solutions he provided included concepts not mentioned during instruction. Ryan sets the bar for a passion to learn how to code.

#### Gametime --- Project

This was an incredibly challenging project. I am extremely pleased with the finished product and the work our team did.

Testing

	4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. 	The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when 	appropriate.

JavaScript Style

	3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

	4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

	3 - Five or fewer complaints
	
#####Evaluation Notes

1. be comfortable breaking logic into other classes or functions
2. keep writing tests.
3. group feels comfortable looping through things. Would love to see them move into using more map functions
4. Saw really great instances of good practices. Would love to see more SRP functions	


#####Feedback from My Partner -- Dale/Christine

Ryan, Christine, and I worked the GameTime project. I was late joining the team but he was supportive and hel
pful in allowing me to catchup to the work that had already done.  He has strong leadership skills with a good self-awareness of where he wants to improve. We were able to establish a great balance of joint and independent work that kept the project moving forward without anyone getting left behind.  Ryan was a great listener as well as being good about talking through techinical challenges. I really look forward to working with him through our time a turing.



## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#####To Andrew, partner on Ideabox: 

What can I say? Andrew is da’ bomb. Ideabox was definitely the hardest project we had so far.  We set clear expectations in the DTR and he completely fulfilled them. We had to work the entire weekend, and he was willing to do it. In the midst of a 10 hour bug, he didn’t stress and worked through it well with me. I was impressed with his persistence and desire to see the code through the finish line. I fully believe he will be a great developer with the potential to add value far beyond lines of code. Whatever company chooses to hire him at the end of the program will be blessed to have him. I would gladly work with him again.

#####To Chelsea, partner on Linked Lists:

Working with Chelsea was a great experience. I was honestly not sure how we would work together, but we ended up complementing each other. There were a couple points where I was moving too fast, she simply recommended a different approach and things started to go better.

She seems to have a good grip on JS and CSS.

She also likes Smashburger milkshakes, which is cool, cause I’m a big fan.

#####To Matt, partner on Number Guesser:

Working with Matt was a good experience. As it was our class’ first project, his knowledge and experience was greater than mine, and yet I felt like I fully contributed. We both had a chance to “drive” and work through the code. The final product was nice.

He was open to different approaches and my ideas. If you have JS questions, you can probably ask Matt :slightly_smiling_face:.

He’s also cool.


### Being a Community Member

#####Note from my mentor, Ross Edfort.

Ryan is an extremely adept junior programmer. From my pairing sessions with him, I can see that he his inquisitive, talented, and eager to learn. He asks great questions, and sometimes is even able to answer his own questions with just a point in the right direction. Ryan has a keen eye for code quality and often writes clean, DRY code. He also is great at communicating. He breaks down his approach to solving problems well, making it easy to dive into his code quickly. One recommendation I have for Ryan is to dive deeper into the code he writes, to deeply understand fundamentals of JavaScript, and programming in general.

#####Other

I joined the Bezos possee and attended several times. My biggest disappointment in this area is not helping with Kids Who Code. I was planning on helping George, but spent both of the Saturdays working on projects. 


### Playing a Part

I attended all Friday events. No way around it, this is an area of growth for me in the next module.
