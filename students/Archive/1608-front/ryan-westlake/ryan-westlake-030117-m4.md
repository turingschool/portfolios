####Feedback to me: 

From Kinan: 
```Ryan brought a full set of professional skills to the table during the production of our project. As we were learning a new javascript library called Electron, we embarked on a journey of unmapped terrain. Overall, collaborating with Ryan was smooth on the soft side, with mostly a clear communication of priority items and an ability to voice his idea of directing the next steps of the project. His organizational skills shined here. I do mention that a desire to have control over each stage of the project could be restricting, since a solid collaboration can mean dividing work loads and leveraging strengths to delegate project needs over attempting to have a stake in it all. Yet, this is how a huge amount of Ryan's technical skills have clearly developed, having a knowledge of a broad variety of tools and solutions to complicated problems on the screen and the whiteboard. This came in hand quite well learning a new technology. I am certain Ryan will be an asset to any team as he deepens his career and look forward to any collaboration we may have in the future.```


####Feedback given by me: 

```Working with Kinan was a great experience. I appreciate his methodical approach, which was a nice balance to my work style. We ended with with a very practical and simple Electron app that we're both proud of. My biggest recommendation as he transitions from Turing to the real-world is communication as he thinks through a problem or approach. Can't wait to see where his career takes him.```


### (Jet Fuel)

From Alex: ```Ryan has all of the characteristics of a great partner: intelligent, driven, dependable, patient, funny, and has great music taste. I admire his hustle everyday and I anticipate I'll be picking his brain for some westlake wisdom in the future. Ryan will find immense success```

####Feedback given by me: 

To Alex: ```Alex is a terrific guy. He was also great to work with. He thinks logically and also enjoys the process of work, not simply the end goal. Excited to see where his career takes him!```

####Feedback to me

From Nick:
```This was my third project working with Ryan, and it was a pleasure as always. I believe he has worked hard to grow both his technical and soft skills while at Turing, and I've noticed him improve in both arenas with each project. He's a fun guy to pair with, and I felt like we had a pretty good workflow when working together. I'd encourage him to keep pushing himself to learn new things, but to be mindful of burnout and overworking. Really terrific work over the past seven months, Ryan! ```

From Lacey: 
```Working with Ryan is always a great experience, and the capstone project was no exception. His growth as a teammate has been extremely evident over the course of time at Turing. He's always been a really hard-worker, but has grown into being a really great team player. He's always willing to hear out other's ideas, is humble with sharing his own ideas, and is conistently stepping back to take a look at the bigger picture. Overall Ryan is going to be a phenomenal leader and part of a development team, and any of the companies giving him offers are going to be really lucky to have him. One piece of advice I have for Ryan is that he can be a humble person but also own how awesome he is. I think he'll go a really long ways with more confidence in who he is and what he brings to the table. I can't wait to see what's next for Ryan, and I hope he keeps me in mind when he starts his fortune 500 company. $$```

####Feedback given by me: 

To Hilary: 
```Alex is a terrific guy. He was also great to work with. He thinks logically and also enjoys the process of work, not simply the end goal. Excited to see where his career takes him!```

To Nick: 
```Once again, Nick was awesome to work with! As he moves from Turing to real-world development, my biggest recommendation is to develop a sense for when to stick with a problem himself and when to seek the help of senior or more experienced developers. It's a fine line but believe it would be helpful. Can't wait to see where his career takes him! ```

To Lacey: 
```Once again, it was great to work with Lacey! She is wellrounded, listens well, knows how to make suggestions, and is fun to be around. I honestly don't have any constructive feedback. Can't wait to see where her career takes her!```


## D: Professional Development
Lia and Meg are great. They are really helpful, open, and patient. 

I completed all PD requirements.

#####Emails - Sent all 6 to Meg - she approved (I had great success with these. 5/6 response and 3 meetings.)
#####Turing Alumni - [Link](https://www.turing.io/alumni/ryan-westlake)
#####Tech Interview - with instructors and at company
#####LinkedIn & Github - approved.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to all of my partners (see projects above). I also provided feedback throughout the mod to other mods on my experience. 

### Being a Community Member

I helped other mods. I also helped with IronFE. Here's feedback from Matt: ```Ryan stepped up to lead an IronFE lesson this mod and did an awesome job. He lead the session with an interesting problem regarding stock prices and how to find the greatest return on investment. He did a great job helping others with the problem and I think it was a great exercise for him to become even more confident in his skills. I think he should continue working to improve his mentoring skills by throwing himself into similar situations in the future. ```

### Playing a Part

Given the workload, I wasn't able to spend as much time volunteering as I hoped. However:  participate in Fridays, attend Bezos possee talks. 

### Gear Up

Gears Ups this mod were awesome. Huge improvement over last mods. It's refreshing to be learning about practical issues in the tech world and not simply things Turing thinks are important.

####Automation

Great chat about automation and how it will impact the world. Our group had a spirited discussion about the merits of it.


####Universal Basic Income

Another awesome one. My notes: 

1. Realities: technology is making it’s way into every industry, leading to more efficient output, which may mean less jobs. A lot of the future economy will be digital
2. Elon Musk is a very successful man who has been right about many things. He’s obviously very smart, but like most “great” matters, smart men and women are on both sides of the table. I don’t think it’s a “foregone conclusion”.
3. UBI is a policy or idea where at some point in the future the government would provide an base level monthly “income” to every person. The funds would flow from tax revenues. The need is believed to have arisen because of technology.
4. Yes, it’s absolutely worth being aware of the issues. As technologists, we work in a field that has a significant impact on automation and technology. The impacts, however, are far reaching.

## Overall Feedback

Mod 4 was great. I was pushed and challenged. The workload was heavy. In fact, I believe it was the most difficult mod. 

- Meeka - you are terrific. I admire your willingness to meet students at their level and find solutions to "sticky" situations.
- Alex - thanks for stepping up to fill Steve's shoes. Every lesson you gave was great. Your willingness to help is awesome. I can't wait until I'm able to debug like you can.
- Brittany - thanks for spending so much time in Denver this mod. It was great to have you and value your code feedback. 

Other feedback will be provided in person.
