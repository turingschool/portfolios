# Graham Nessler- M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to gain a firm foundation in essential programming concepts and principles, in addition to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also wanted to start narrowing down my areas of interest, both in terms of skill sets and possible areas of professional focus. I've made progress in both: I've learned that my chief skill interest so far is JavaScript, which I had thought was my weakest area upon entering the program. I've also started to develop a strong collaborative relationship with my mentor, Justin Crawford, who has taught me a lot about the tech industry and possible career paths.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.38 (average of my 4 scores)
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5 (Clear and significant growth in my work, but I feel that I could have pushed myself harder at times)
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 (While I was a fully involved teammate and contributed a great deal to projects in a technical sense, I feel that I need to improve my active listening and group collaboration skills. Though I was a professional teammate in all of my projects and tried to help and learn when I could, I sometimes had a tendency to want to complete much of the project myself, rather than collaboratively with teammates, or to try to control the coding rather than genuinely working as a team. My previous profession was largely "lone wolf" and so I am learning new and important skills in this program when it comes to teamwork.)
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3 (This is an area that was neglected a bit by me due largely to time constraints, but I do know much more about this new profession than I did on Day 1, and I feel that my work with my mentor is especially valuable in learning the professional development side of the field.)
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3.5 (Notwithstanding the points made in C above, I am surprised at how involved I felt as a community- and cohort member this module. Though I sometimes had the tendency to want to retreat into my own work, I often helped others, such as when I taught one cohort mate about debugger before our lesson on that topic and when I helped another set up bash scripts. Though I have a ways to go to reach the gold standard of someone like Andy from 1606 FE with respect to giving my time for others, I do feel like I am making a real contribution to the community, and I look forward to pairing with the 1610 students next module.)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects this module were my professional portfolio site and the color changer.

#### Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

###### Project Description:
I created an app that starts with a white background and contains a button to change the color to a random value except for white. The randomization was achieved by using Math.random() to assign values to each of the three values in an rgb color, with a range of 0 to 254 (not 255 because I wanted to prevent pure white from showing up.) There is also a reset button that reverts the background color to white.

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
N/A

#### Portfolio Site

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/portfolio-site)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

###### Project Description:
This is a website to showcase my professional accomplishments: projects, resume, and links to the book I wrote in another life. The site follows a fairly simple but inviting layout of a blue and white gradient border, dropdown nav menu, and separate pages for home, project menu, showcase for each project, and work/educational background. The site also includes a footer with social media symbols that enlarge when the user hovers over them.

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:
TBD

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

As I indicated above, adapting to working in group/team projects was a bit of a learning curve for me, but I experienced many benefits to working with a partner(s). In addition to learning a lot from my partners, I also built friendships that I might not have forged had all or most of the work been individual.

#### Number Guesser

Partner: Kinan Whyte

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [My Blog Post on Number Guesser](https://gness1804.github.io/Personal-Blog/number-guesser-08-25-16.html)

This was our first big JavaScript project. Our objective was to create a program that compares a pseudo-random number between 1 and 100 to a number that the user inputs. The program offers feedback as to whether the number is too low, too high, out of the accepted range, or not as number. If the user correctly guesses the computer's number, the program informs the user and chooses a new number within a new range of +10 and -10 of the original range. The user can also manually adjust the max and min range of the random number.

In part because we were both fairly green, Kinan and I encountered a few stumbling blocks, but we created a respectable final product. After our post-submission evaluation, I had a very productive pairing session with Brett Hevia from 1606, and I then refactored a lot of our JavaScript to make our functions more efficient.

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:

Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

Fundamental JavaScript Style

2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

Jhun's comments:

"notes: lots of globals could refactor with a mentor on how to utilize closures and reuse functions.

strong effort. you've established some good rhythms"

From Kinan: "During the times we have paired, Graham has always been a focused, well-articulated, organized, and thoughtful partner to have. He has consistently presented himself as eager to learn, kind, and very well attuned to the details of work at hand. Overall, I can say Graham will be an asset to any team he ends up on and look forward to our future collaboration during Turing!"

#### Linked List

Partner: Alex Pilewski

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [My Blog Post on Linked List](https://gness1804.github.io/Personal-Blog/linked-list-09-03-16.html)

This project involved the creation of a program wherein users could enter in a title and bookmark for their favorite sites, which would then be populated on the bottom of the page. The user can mark the bookmarks as read or unread, remove all bookmarks, and remove read bookmarks. The program keeps track of the number of bookmarks on the page and the number that are read and unread at any given point in time. Since there was no server side component to the project, all the data was lost whenever the user reset the browser.

As I indicated in my notes to him, Alex and I had pretty close to a perfect rhythm and workflow for this project. When we encountered a snag, we'd be able to talk it out and come to a solution. I felt that this project was less difficult than the prior project, in large part I think due to my prior experience and the fact that abilities were greater than they had been when I did number guesser.

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:

Functional Expectations: 4
HTML Style: 4
CSS Style: 4
Fundamental JavaScript style: 3
Workflow: 4

Notes from Jhun:

"developers are referencing the document multiple times
could refactor to use closures
good solid effort.
great workflow! Bazillion commits for the win!
no globals for the win!"

From Alex: "Graham was an absolute pleasure to work with. Very empathetic with my initial git discomfort and a very disciplined worker. 10/10"

#### Idea Box

Partner: Adam Rice

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This was a rough project in places because it centered around local storage and JSON, which involved a steep learning curve and considerably increased the program's complexity. The project involved a program wherein the user entered an idea title and idea body, which were both then transferred to the bottom of the page--similar to Linked List, but this time, the data was to be stored by the browser and persisted after page reload. Ideas could change in "status" (quality) per user input and be deleted from the app with the click of an X box. Our biggest single obstacle was keeping up with the items in local storage, particularly as relates to the deletion of items from local storage. The talk by Steve on the "monstertorium" helped immensely, and we were able to power through the issues to create a solid project. The project also enabled me to become friends with Adam, as we discovered that we had a lot in common and spent some quality time watching football once we had finished the project. We worked well together, and I hope to work with him again.

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

From Adam: "Graham is a great partner. He is flexible in regards to setting up times to meet and friendly during discussions. He is willing to help when you have questions and shows a strong interest in being a team player."

#### Game Time

Partners: Lacey Knaff and Gabrielle Procell

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gprocell927/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Wow...Game Time was a doozy. The project involved a very large learning curve, combining Webkit, canvas, and testing, plus the many other challenges of producing a fully functioning and attractive game in less than two weeks. Along with almost every other group, we struggled a great deal, especially the first week, but we were able to push through the challenges to produce a project that I am proud of, and I am confident that my teammates share my sentiments. I feel that our skills in JavaScript and in understanding program state significantly improved. In particular, I have a much better understanding of object-oriented programming and its advantages than I did when I started the project. I was also fortunate to work with both Lacey and Gabi, who contributed many critical insights, including many JavaScript fixes that I couldn't see. We are also lucky to have Lacey's design skills on our team, as one can see from the game's graphics and interface.  

###### Evaluation Comments and Scores:

Evaluator: Brenna

Notes:

Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

From Gabi: "I had a great experience working with Graham on Game Time. He is a true master of git commit, and I aspire to be at his level of commits in Mod 2. Graham is very calculating in his approach to programming. He was amazing at communicating with the team on updates that he had made to our program, if he was having an issue with an area of the program, or if he had suggestions for features to implement in our program.  Graham was also very approachable when I was having issues with our team's workflow, and I appreciated him listening and understanding my needs. I appreciate everything that you have done to contribute to our team, and our cohort, Graham!"

From Lacey: "I really enjoyed working with Graham on game time. He's an insanely hard worker and often would work late into the night fixing bugs and implementing code and functionality that was above and beyond the expectations of the spec and our group. His workflow style is also one of the best things about working with Graham. He is a constant reinforcer of making frequent commits, something that I usually forget to do. Overall, I had a great experience working with Graham, and hope we get paired together again in the future!"

My required DTR is the one that the three of us created for Game Time, which provided a good road map for the project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJbaKRqudf4Eyl7FzgJ3HsUBb9TglRdeiMMa_g2bYLw/edit?usp=sharing

## D: Professional Skills
(Not required for Mod 1)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Alex: "Alex was my partner for Linked List, the second team project of the mod. From day 1, we seemed to be on the same page; I found that my workflow with Alex was the best of all of my team experiences for the mod. Alex had a lot of insights and has a great sense of humor to boot. I hope we are paired up again in the future. "

To Kinan: "Kinan was my partner for Number Guesser, the first team project of the module. As my previous career was largely a “lone wolf” endeavor, I had some growing pains in adjusting to the group dynamic, but Kinan was a patient and thoughtful collaborator who always had an ear to listen. He also taught me a lot about using Git and Github, as this was my first group experience with this type of version control. I feel that our end project was strong and that we worked well together. Nice work, Kinan!"

To Gabi: "Working with Gabi on game time was great! She is concerned with the feelings of each person in the group and makes sure that every one is allowed time to play their part in the group. She is excellent with writing tests, and driven to accomplish anything she sets out to do. If she couldn't get a test to pass, or debug lines of code, she was asking for help within the Turing community and always had the best intentions for our group in mind by sharing her take aways in a clear and easy to understand way. Overall, she is a great team player and I really enjoyed working with her."

To Lacey: "It was a pleasure working with Lacey. Her knowledge of design is unparalleled, and she also had a lot of useful insights on JavaScript. The project hit some significant snags, but Lacey was always there with good insights to help us move forward. Nice job on a great game!"

To Adam: "I really enjoyed working with Adam. We were paired together for Idea Box, which was the most challenging project we'd had to date, and the most challenging project of the mod aside from Game Time. Adam made a lot of excellent suggestions and did a very good job with the design. It was a pleasure and I hope to be paired with him again."

To Devin: "Devin is a great asset to our program. She is a consistently positive presence in our cohort and always strives to bring out the best in her peers. I’ve been happy to be her colleague and friend during this module, and I hope to be paired with her in the future."

In addition to my feedback to former partners for projects, I also offered feedback to others in the form of looking over others' code and portfolio sites at times, speaking up at retros and other group events, and offering tips from time to time on the module Slack channel.

### Being a Community Member

From Devin: "Graham is always willing to stop what he’s doing and try to help problem solve. I even saw him get up a few times during project work time and go around and ask if everyone was okay or needed help. I’m very appreciative of his efforts to make sure he was answering questions for people when he had the ability to.
"

In addition to feedback received from project partners, I also learned a ton from 1606ers like Brett and Kyle, who were pairing buddies, as well as Andy, who at one point spent at least an hour and a half going through our Idea Box troubleshooting when he surely had many commitments of his own. That type of dedication serves as an inspiring example for us as we prepare to welcome the new 1610 cohort.

On a related note: some of my best learning experiences have come from pairing sessions with 1606 students. In addition to learning a great deal myself, the fact that they knew so much yet were only a few weeks ahead of us is encouraging.

### Playing a Part

As I alluded to above, I feel that I did a fairly good job of contributing to the Turing community, but there's definitely room for improvement, especially as concerns the world beyond "160gr8". For one, my posse activity was limited. That is in part because my initial posse proved a poor fit and I chose to switch, but I could have done more regardless. I look forward to becoming involved in my new posse (Bezos) starting in Mod 2.
