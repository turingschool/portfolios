# Graham Nessler - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goals for this module were to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and to gain more proficiency and confidence in testing, an area that I felt I was weak in at the end of Mod 1. I also wanted to increase my community involvement and to do more with professional development. I was generally successful in these goals, though testing is still something that I struggle with.

The module got off to something of a rough start with a difficult first project and then facing React, which was definitely the biggest challenge of the module. Nonetheless, I feel that I grew a great deal as a developer and as a teammate this module. I plan to focus next module on improving my React skills and on refining my focus within tech.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: ~3 9(see below)
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3 (I feel that my individual work was strong, but due to time constraints, I feel that I did not put forth my best efforts on the small styling projects.)
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 (I grew as a teammate this module, but a teamwork issue with one of the projects reminded me that I still have a ways to go in this area.)
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5 (I feel much more comfortable about my efforts this mod than last mod; my company tracker is a useful tool and I wrote a couple of cold emails and went to a meetup.)
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3.5 (I feel that I was more involved in the community this mod)

This was a rebuild of Number Guesser, a Mod 1 project, in React. It was meant to prepare us for our individual assessment for this module.

# Evaluator: Jhun

**Comments:**

- great naming
- loved small dumb components
- would benefit a lot from moving state from one componenet doing the logic to other components helping
- developer seems comfortable creating small components. Has opportunity to move logic to those components
- 3 in Fundamental JavaScript is a little soft.

## Functional Expectations

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [GH Pages](https://hilarylewis92.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)

This was a pivot of our Mod 1 project Idea Box. It allows a user to enter tasks, delete them, order them, and rank them by five levels of importance. It was essentially a rehash of Idea Box with some extra features and testing.

# Evaluator: Jhun
# Comments:

* code could use some refactoring.
* SRP ops
* beef up tests
* a couple of bugs with adding more todos to the page / hiding completed.

* 3 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing * 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.


# Accessibility


* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0 - 3 aXe-core violations.


# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than * 3 aXe-core violations


# HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

# CSS/Sass Style


* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

Feedback from Hilary: "Graham was wonderful to work with on 2DoBox. He is very smart and makes sure to get the job done quickly and efficiently. He is good a talking me through every aspect of the project and he consistently makes sure we are on the same page with every single line of code. I wish we had more time for the project so Graham and I could have more time to refactor and shorten our code. Graham has a lot to offer a team and he is one of the hardest workers I have worked with yet."

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
* [GH Pages](https://gness1804.github.io/weathrly/)

This is a weather app using a fake API. It was our first project in React, so it involved a steep learning curve. It allows the user to view weather forecast data for four cities and sends the user to an external site for additional cities.

Evaluation scores: N/A

Feedback from Kristen: "I was so pleased to be paired with Graham for our first forray into writing React components, working with API data, and testing with Enzyme. The learning process and implemenation of the new tools used in the Weathrly project were fundamental for the the rest of the module, and Graham was a great partner for laying that foundation. I often learn new concepts best when given the opportunity to dig into  them on my own, and then convene with my partner to discuss my findings/process/progress. Graham was encouraging to this process, and furthermore, he was able to effectively help me fill in several gaps in understanding. He is exceptionally bright, and while sometimes his code gets particularly complex, I never felt like we were disconnected in the process. Graham has an unparallelled work ethic that he delivers with a positive and pleasant outlook. He would be a remarkable asset to any team, and I hope we have the chance to work together again sometime! "

#### Shoot the Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)
* [Firebase Live Site](https://shoot-the-breeze-b5e3f.firebaseapp.com/)

This project involved building a chat room where multiple users could interact. Users can enter messages, filter messages by user, and sort messages. This was our first Firebase project, which allowed us to see the possibilities of storing data in this database (a much better alternative to localStorage!).  

# Evaluator: Meeka

# Comments:

All components must be tested using Enzyme - You do not need to test authentication. - Note: sort is tested through application but ChatMaster is not tested.

Submit and Clear are disabled when there is no content in the message input - Note: visual change for disabled buttons would make things clearer

Submit is disabled when the message is over 140 characters: Character count color change is a really nice touch

### Based on comps - the following differences are noted:
- Change of text for users in the user component (reads: 'Users Present in the Chat Room')
- List of users is shown as button
- Logged in user does not have a red indicator beside their name in sidebar user component
- Email is shown for users
- Text instead of arrows for the sort buttons
- displays first and last name and not just first name
- Log out was not in the spec but was added
- Messages should still show if logged out (currently don't)
- Mobile view - the name of the app is still present
- Mobile view - date should be shortened
- Mobile view - character count should be beside the message bar

# Specification Adherence

* 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

(extension was done (log out) but not communicated - however, we have not communicated very well that communicating should be communicated)

# Component Architecture

* 3 - Application is broken in out into at least 8 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

# CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

# Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

Note: 1 uniq complaint

# Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

Feedback from Gabi: "Graham is the ultimate code workhorse. This was my second project working with Graham, and he is still 100% all-in to the project. I am always impressed with his ability to quickly grasp and implement new concepts. Graham still remains the git workflow and console.log master. An area that Graham could benefit from working on would be communication workflow. It seems easy for Graham to get consumed by the project, but the project partner(s) may sometimes suffer in this situation. Navigating or ping-pong pairing may slow down workflow a bit, but could also help to open up Graham's communicative workflow in the future.  Thank you again, Graham, for your hard work!"

#### Netwerker/Fire-Bae/Tier Two Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gness1804/netwerker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)
* [Firebase Live Site](https://netwerker-3d622.firebaseapp.com/)

In this capstone project for the module, we chose to create a networking app to store professional contacts. The app stores info such as names, company, and social media; allows users to flag contacts for follow-up; contains a search feature; and allows the user to upload images for each contact. While this app used the React and Firebase technologies that we'd been introduced to earlier, the implementation of both was much more complex because the app had so many more moving parts than previous ones. I really learned a lot from my partners and also made my own distinct contributions to the project.

# Evaluator: Meeka

# Comments:

# Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.

# Risk Taking and Creativity

* 4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

# Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

# HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

# CSS/Sass Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Accessibility

* 3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has * 0-* 3 aXe-core violations.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints


Feedback from Matt: "Working with Graham on our last project was a treat and a priviledge. He's an extremely hard worker and a super reliable teammate. Graham is a good programmer with a lot of knowledge of Javascript. He's clearly very smart and an asset to any team. If I had any tips to help him, I'd recommend that he tries to program with fewer comments and try to pay attention to some more modern styles of websites when designing. Graham is a really great dude with a wonderful sense of humor, I love spending time with him in class. Thanks Graham!"

Feedback from Christine: "I worked with Graham, along with Matt, on the fire-bae project. I thought the three of us worked really well together. It is clear that Graham has a solid understanding of React and Javascript. I was especially impressed with his workflow and hope to implement some of those practices in my work."

## D: Professional Skills
I really feel like I improved my professional development skills this mod. In addition to going to my first meet-up, I completed a useful company tracker, got favorable feedback on my resume from Meg, and wrote a couple of cold emails. I also contributed a lot of my Gear Up groups.

### Gear Up

#### Resilience (11/4)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This was an interesting session (interesting in a good way). I learned a lot from the others in my group, and I also contributed a lot, especially when I made the point that one way to actively exercise resilience is to seek out constructively uncomfortable situations such as partnering with someone who is more technically advanced. Also, given recent national events, this session ended up bring unintentionally well-timed. All in all, I got a lot out of this session.

#### Introversion (10/21)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This session hit home for me because I am an introvert and I identify with many of the challenges identified by the material that we read/watched. I was surprised that so many others in our cohort identify as introverts and face many of the same challenges that I do. I also appreciate that Turing seems to be implementing more introvert-friendly practices following this session such as designating quiet spaces and offering more independent learning opportunities.

In terms of feedback for Turing, I think that there was still too much reading and not enough discussion time in this session and too many questions to discuss or write about in depth (though I appreciate that at the following Gear Up, Ellen Mary made a special point that we could focus on only one or two of the discussion questions rather than trying to tackle them all). In spite of the issues, I feel that this was the most valuable Gear Up of this module.

#### Vote Your Conscience (10/7)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This election-themed session was obviously very timely and helped us think about some of the broader implications of our work. It also reminded us that our work does not take place in a vacuum. I like the fact that we had an informed and respectful discussion, and I learned a lot from the others, especially one who is a former lawyer. This was a valuable session, though there were issues with too much reading and not enough discussion.

### Professional Development

## Company Tracker:

This project involved finding ten companies of interest and creating a Trello board with details such as pros, cons, and one contact at each company. It has proven useful in my preliminary job exploration.

* [Link to Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/puwSzkqy/graham-nessler-company-tracker)

## Cold Email:

I sent a cold email to a person at CaptainU; full text is available upon request.

## DTR:

[Here is a DTR from the 2DoBox project with Hilary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UKh547f9EXn_RwLTpZ-UqR6S08GRjIxEnRL7GqIGYic/edit?usp=sharing)

## Reflection:

*Two paragraph reflection on:
Details on project management strategies you used in your projects; What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?
How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.*

In our projects, we attempted a variety of strategies to manage the various moving parts. With Hilary, it seemed like we often adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy, which to some extent played to our individual strengths but also hindered communication at times. Kristen and I worked more closely on our project, but still could have done more collaborative coding. With the exception of the production bugs in 2DoBox, I feel that all of the projects that I worked on resulted in a solid mvp. I think that things went best when I was in a group that was on the same page and actively coding together, like the collaboration with Matt and Christine on the final project. By contrast, communication sometimes broke down when I tried to take on too much by myself and my partner sometimes did not raise a red flag early enough to signal that a change of direction was needed.

Along the same lines, I feel that I started to really develop as a team programmer in the project with Matt and Christine. As I mentioned in the portfolio for Mod 1, my background is in solo work, and my inclination has been to try to do a lot of the work myself rather than collaboratively. I think that I turned a corner in this respect toward the end of the mod, though, and I look forward to continuing to build my teamwork skills next mod.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Hilary

I enjoyed working with Hilary on 2DoBox. Though we had a few bumps in the road, such as my getting food poisoning the night before the project was due, I feel that we had a good workflow. In a future project, though, I think that we would benefit from starting testing and refactoring earlier. In particular, I think that some of our production-stage bugs could have been avoided if we'd begun testing earlier. Overall, though, it was great to partner with Hilary, and I hope to work together again.

#### Feedback for Kristen

Kristen, I enjoyed working with you a lot on Weathrly. You were consistently upbeat and contributed a great deal to the project. We really struggled at first with React, but your positive attitude and sense of humor helped see us through. Hope we can work together again in the future!

#### Feedback for Gabi

Our third major project of the mod, Shoot the Breeze, was my second project working with Gabi. We could both tell that our skill had definitely improved since Game Time, but we also hit some communication problems in staying on the same page and in sync with regards to both workflow and making sure that each partner understands all of the code. I feel that we worked through these problems well, though, and by the end we were "clicking" much more effectively (and we also turned in a really solid final product to boot). Gabi has always been a positive presence in our cohort, and I've been happy to have been able to work with her twice now. I hope that the matching algorithm makes it a hat trick in the future.

#### Feedback for Matt

Matt and I worked together in a group of three with Christine on Netwerker, our capstone project for the module. By this time, Matt had acquired a reputation for being the most advanced student in our cohort, and I entered the project hoping to learn a lot from him. He didn't disappoint; I really did learn a great deal during our two weeks working on the project. He encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone and learn more effective ways of writing code. Matt also spent a lot of time helping fellow students in our mod and in 1610, which speaks to his character and to the camaraderie that Turing cultivates.

#### Feedback for Christine

Christine was my partner, along with Matt, for Fire-Bae/Netwerker. I found her to be a good listener and patient with me when I made coding mistakes or waded into problematic territory. I learned a lot from them both about teamwork and group/partner coding. I thought that Christine and I worked particularly well together near the end of the project when we were doing final CSS/SASS refactoring together; we established a nice rhythm and got a lot done.

### Being a Community Member

From Anonymous Mod 1 Student (probably Elijah): "Graham was a huge help in bridging a gap between concepts that I couldn't seem to wrap my head around.  It is clear he has a concern for helping others along their way and makes it abundantly clear through his patient guiding and last minute pairings."

From Ian: "Graham has been an excellent addition to the Turing community this module. He is a kind person that genuinely cares about the success of others. He did a great job helping start and run IronFE, and does not hesitate to help other students and post solutions to common problems."

### Playing a Part

I feel like I contributed a lot to the Turing community this module. I paired several times with 1610 students and also helped others in my own mod when they were struggling. I also participated in the Verou posse and gave a talk at IronFE on localStorage. I plan to continue my community involvement next module by giving a talk for Verou on Canvas, continuing to help fellow students, and hopefully pairing with mods 1 and 2 (though geography might make this difficult).
