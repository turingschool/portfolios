#### Comments: Try not to push up entire files that have commented out code. Start to feel comfortable just deleting code. Should not append a <li> to a <section>

##### Specification Adherence

* 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing * 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.
  - "The application should only show the ten most recent TODOS."
  - The application should contain a button labeled “Show more TODOs …”

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### FeedBack from Gabi Procell
Working with Dale has lead me to gain a newfound appreciation for one's ability to destructure bigger problems into smaller components. Dale has also shown great leadership within the cohort by spearheading our front end Iron FE daily study group.  From our time on the 2DoBox Pivot project, I do remember Dale expressing some frustration with OOP. I hope that OOP began to come to him more naturally as he was able to implement it throughout the module. Thanks, Dale for being a great partner and cohort member!

##### Feedback from Kinan Whyte
Working with Dale has been a great pleasure. His ability to plan ahead with projects and to approach the software process is strong and indicates a healthy background in project management. This has made workflow very effective and smooth. He has taken initiative for our cohort to host review sessions nearly every morning on the weekdays, which has certainly strengthened bonds among students and solidified concepts for our group. Indeed the name of these groups, IronFE, has stayed true to its meaning. Dale is approachable and patient with learning concepts and progressing through the software development process, both vital to setting and constructing a classroom for optimal learning. If he could improve on anything it would be to increase his speed and workflow skills. His pace to thinking is refreshing and ultimately his process is clean and efficient. While implementing features and writing code, however, I could see some room for learning more shortcut keys and gaining some time with the keyboard to increase muscle memory. I suggest typing.io for this. Overall, I am confident Dale will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with him.

### Shoot the Breeze

* [Shoot the Breeze]()
* [Code Base](https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/shootthebreeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

#### Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot the breeze
#### Instructor: Jhun

- more conversations in the pr
- great components
- great tests!
- ui issues with the button
- also messages are still submitted without any text in the field.

#### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


#### Component Architecture

* 4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.


#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application (aside from logging in).

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### Design

* 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.


##### Feedback from Chelsea Skovgaard
Dale is methodical and thoughtful. I appreciated how he proposed and we enacted taking a step back from the project at the beginning to sketch out the project, consider how the different components would interact, and draw out the process. In other projects, my partners and I have dived into immediately coding and it was difficult to see the big picture and how the components would interact. Dale is also good at talking through processes, which help lead to a clearer understanding of concepts. It was also useful that we attempted to use agile practices - creating a component, designing, then testing. Although this became difficult to implement when we didn’t fully understand how to do testing in enzyme. One suggestion I have to Dale is to work on asking for help more often if needed. Since at times, it seemed he was hesitant to reach out for help.

#### MoMoney (Fire-Bae)

* [Code Base](https://github.com/dshendrickson/mo-money)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

### Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
#### Instructor: Meeka

##### Specification Adherence

* 4 - Bumped to a 4 with the zero value fix!

##### Risk Taking and Creativity

* 4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

##### Design

* 3.5 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

Notes: Sign out should maybe be above or below
Grey space on the sides
Indication of sample card being a sample card

##### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

##### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### FeedBack from Lacey Knaff

##### Feedback from Ian Lancaster
I truly enjoyed working with Dale on Mo Money, and would gladly work with him again. Dale is not only an exemplary member of the Turing community, but also a great leader. Dale worked collaboratively and effectively with both Lacy and myself from start to finish for this project. I especially appreciated the experience and knowledge about SCRUM and agile methodologies that he brought to the table, and his calm and focused demeanor in the face of gitastrophe. While Dale wrote a substantial portion of the code for this project, most of the React portion was done as a group. I think it would have benefited both the project as a whole and Dale's confidence working with react if he went in and did a bit of react refactoring on his own.

##### Feedback from Lacey Knaff
I had a fantastic time working with Dale on our group project, MoMoney. He is an incredibly efficient planner and manager. Throughout the project he made sure to facilitate checkins with the group, utilized waffle effectively, and shared his skills in Agile work methods. I learned a lot from his leadership in the project. Some things Dale could work on are confidence in his abilities as a developer, I think he knows more than he gives himself credit for and I sometimes think it makes him question himself when he doesn't need to.  I also appreciated his feedback in our final review about focusing on areas of weakness in projects. I hope that we can work together on future projects to have the opportunity to share more of our strengths, as I think we could learn a lot from each other. Thanks Dale!

### Playing a Part

Andrew Crist and I formed a study group called 'ironFE' that meets at 8:00AM on Monday-Thursday.  The intent was an informal community driven session to present and discuss changes that people were facing with code and approaches. Matt Kaufman became a regular attendee and presenter/trouble shooter, and along with Gabi Procell, we developed a core group. Though the sessions usually don't have large attendance, I sense that the cohort likes knowing that they are being held and can attend as needed.
