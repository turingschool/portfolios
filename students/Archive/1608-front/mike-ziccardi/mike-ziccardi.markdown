# Mike Ziccardi - M1 Portfolio

 ## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of HTML CSS JQuery and Javascript. My main goal for this module was to pass and understand what I was doing, and why I was doing it. I had a few rough weeks, but the last 3 weeks I feel I improved more than I expected

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

 Here are some of the cool projects we did this module. During each project, We would focus on adding another development tool. We started with a number guesser game in order to practice using Javascript. from there we learned JQuery and implemented that on our second project of linked list. Our third project built off of the previous two and added setting and getting items out of local storage. Our last project added everything together in order to make our very own game.

#### NUMBER GUESSER

 * [GitHub URL](https://mziccardi.github.io/number-guesser/)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

 Our first project was a Number Guessing app. We used Javascript in order to grab HTML elements on the page and create a working game.

  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

  Functional Expectations:4


  Fundamental JavaScript Style:2.5

 notes: Excellent effort to refactor code. Love that you pulled out methods and conditionals to separate functions. I think there is room for refactoring. Some smelly long functions


Dale Hendrickson [2:42 PM]  
I worked with Mike on Number Guesser, the first project for 1608-FE.  We worked effectively together and did most of the work in joint pairing.  I came to the project with more knowledge of the command-line and git and Mike was eager to learn those tools.  Though he often said he, "wasn’t getting it,” he kept working hard and understated what he was learning.  I was great to work with him on my first Turing group project.

#### LINKED LIST

 * [GitHub URL](https://mziccardi.github.io/linkedList/)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

 The Second project we were assigned was a Linked List. This project focused on jquery and building on the JavaScript knowledge that we had been working with for the first project.

 Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Working with Mike on Linked List was a joy. His sense of humor (oddly similar to mine) provided comic relief during the many troughs of this project. Mike has an eye for syntax which indubitably prevented stressful bugs we would have faced down the road. This was the first project that really forced us deeper into jQuery and using github for versioning. Mike plunged head first into wanting to figure out github instead of using hacks to version our code. Additionally, Mike sacrificed a lot of private events to complete our project. His selfless dedication is an example I want to personally live out.

#### IDEA BOX

* [GitHub URL](https://mziccardi.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

  Idea box was our third project where we focused on using JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON in order to store data into the browsers local storage and to get that data out of storage and to render it back onto the page.

  Evaluator: Bree

 Specification Adherence

 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

 User Interface

 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

 JavaScript Style

 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

 Workflow

 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

 Mike was a really great partner to have on the challenging Idea Box project. We faced a lot of difficulties in this project, but we were still able to maintain a positive attitude as we took on numerous hurdles. Mike has exceptional problem solving skills that are are very valuable when writing code as a pair. I felt like we commuinicated well throughout the project, and we both learned a tremendous amount that served us well as we finished the module. I genuinely enjoyed having Mike as a partner, and I hope that we are a pair again in the future!

#### GAME TIME

* [GitHub URL](https://maiastone.github.io/game-time/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

 for the last project we were assigned Game time. This was the final project for the module and most definitely the hardest. For this project Maia and I chose to do the game 2048. Not only did we use the information that we learned in the module, we also took it upon ourselves to learn about linked lists and how to implement it within our game.

 Evaluator: Taylor Moore

Student: Maia & Mike

Notes: Scores are based off the continued work on this project. Maia and Mike are meeting Taylor to review the work over the break on Wednesday, 12pm. Super impressed with the group for taking on the challenge to create a quad linked-list. Things to look for on Wednesday - Testing, more instructions, 'you lose screen', more organization. Nice job!

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

Working with Mike was awesome.  He was willing and eager to take on the challenge of learning the linked list structure which was outside the scope of our curriculum, and that required even more work for an already tough project.  The only constructive advice I would say is to have more confidence.  You know way more than you think!  You did stay positive though, and I really appreciate that, because we had some tough days and moments.  We were able to express that we were frustrated, but stay motivated and keep working until we had our game working!  I love that neither of us settled for mediocrity.  Our workflow was great and I really enjoyed pairing together for most of the work but dividing when needed.  It was a great team experience for me, and I learned a ton!  I look forward to continuing to refine the project. Thank you.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

feedback given

To Dale:  Dale was my partner on our very first project. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around javascript and Dale helped me to get a better grasp. He would always help explain things when I had questions, and was always happy to repeat himself. For our first project I was happy to be paired with Dale. He’s the Git master and is always happy to help when anybody has questions.


To Andrew:  Working with Andrew on the Linked-List project was a very good experience. The first few weeks of the module I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the content we were learning and Andrew was very helpful in explaining fuzzy concepts to me as we worked through them on the projects. Andrew was great at communication and really explaining his vision for the project, and was also open to suggestions and seeing things in different perspectives. 10/10 would work with him again.

To Kristen:  Working with Kristen was great. She really understood what we were doing when working on the Idea Box project. We worked a lot together through tough problems and got some pretty good work done. I would be happy to work with Kristen again especially now that I’m feeling more confident with the work we have been doing!

To Maia:  I really enjoyed working with Maia on game time. We tackled something that we didn’t fully understand, and through that we were able to grow our working knowledge of Javascript and the other concepts we have learned in this module. We communicated well and worked through and pushed both pairing together and on our own. She was always available to play “rubber ducky” and help to bounce ideas and concepts off of. We kept our spirits high though a tough project and I feel that I will be a stronger team mate and partner after working with maia

### Being a Community Member

From Lacey: Mike is probably one of the funniest and most genuine people I’ve met. He has a great way of making people feel included in conversations and expresses interest in getting to know each and every person. His ability to make others feel comfortable is a great addition to our community, and I feel very lucky to have him in our cohort. I haven’t had the opportunity to work on any projects with Mike, but am hoping to in the future!

### Playing a Part
