Edited version for your portfolio

It was a pleasure to work with Mike. I appreciate his willingness to work through tough issues. I was impressed by his grit, and willingness to not give up when things aren’t working. He is also an enjoyable guy to pair with. My advice for areas to grow and improve are: 1) stay positive… the only impact negativity can have is, well, negative. Don’t doubt your abilities, IQ, or knowledge. You are a smart guy, and I totally believe you can do it. When you feel like saying something that will not help, remember, all the things you have gotten through before and just break it down to it’s simplest form. 2) Write more and more code to get more comfortable with syntax. It’s one of those things that just comes with repetition, so do whatever you need to get more and more comfortable with it.
##Nick Chamber
I had a lovely experience working with Mike. He's a fun guy to share a project with and is always up for injecting a bit of levity into the experience of solving frustratingly complex problems. Mike has a solid work ethic and isn't afraid to put in long hours and grind through tasks. I think his grit and work ethic are going to help him continue to evolve into a truly adept programmer. While it's completely normal and expected to doubt oneself and feel hesitant when figuring out how to write software, I think Mike could benefit from trusting in his intelligence and work ethic. Sometimes when working to come up with a solution to a difficult problem, Mike will default to hesitation and lose his confidence. I think the one thing Mike could benefit most from is trusting that he is super smart and totally knows what he is doing. When working with Mike, I saw him come up with lots of elegant solutions to tough problems, but I think he sometimes needs a reminder that he’s truly a strong problem solver and smart dude. He should embrace it!

# Specification Adherence

* 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


# Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.


# User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


# HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


# CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.



# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

Mike has been a great person to work with. He offers an ideal approach to project management which goes a long way in the the software development process. He is approachable, able to see what work we need to accomplish, and what timelines make sense to accomplish them. On times where we were stressed or under-estimated work time, Mike has remained calm, collected, and encouraging. He is able to hold concepts in his mind well, and is able to give honest feedback when needed about where he is. If he could improve on anything it would be to give himself more credit. He can be hard on himself, but for what has been put on the plate, he is doing great and is definitely suited for this work. I would also say that he should take more opportunities to solidify understanding by supplementing learning with typing and re-writing projects if necessary just to get the muscle memory. I am confident Mike will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with him.

#### Feedback from me
I really enjoyed working with Ryan. His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into small speed bumps during our time working on 2dobox. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. One thing that I feel would be beneficial to Ryan is to take more breaks. for me the long stretches of coding would cause me to have worse focus and not get much progress. Ryan has really been killing it lately and i’m happy to be in class with him

I really enjoyed working with Chelsea on Firebae. She was able to help us create an awesome wire frame for our app and help us visualize the direction we wanted to go! Chelsea kept the group positivity up while running into problems. Her strengths in styling helped me to become better at styling my own things.

Working with Alex on FireBae AKA BetsketBall was great. Since i’m not a huge sports fan, Alex had to explain the basics of sports betting and all of the things to think about when betting on a winning team .  We had some tough logical problems to think through and alex never lost sight of the problem to solve. it was hard for me to follow along with some of the logic but alex never stopped trying to explain what we were attempting to do.
