# Michael Ziccardi - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I feel like this module gave me the opportunity to see my full potential and I feel as if I have seen the most growth
in mod 3. During this mod we focused on refining skills learned in earlier mods. We worked on fundamentals like object and array manipulation
as well as getting better with react and react router, learning to use redux with larger react apps and even got a look into MVC style frameworks with our Ember project. I enjoyed working on my personal project, however I feel like we didn't get much time to work on it. I didn't quite get as far as I would have liked but this gives me a chance to go back to my project and work on implementing more features and fine tuning the ones that I did manage to get in there.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS

## B: Individual Work & Projects

 the first project we were assigned was an individual assignment to learn router. We did the chuck noris joke maker in order to learn router and get more comfortable with api calls and fetch requests.

#### Chuck Noris
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mziccardi/chuck-norris)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

Student: Mike Ziccardi

Notes:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested  

 I really enjoyed working on my personal project. Firebase and designing what it was supposed to look like were the two things that I found most challenging. I am in no way an artist. I realize that i'm in the frontend program and I should be learning how to style, but designing what the app should look like was/is very difficult for me. It's not the best looking app and its not fully functional but i'm proud of what i did and am excited to keep working on it.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

 We worked on 2 group projects this module. The first group project was Redux weather forecast project. Our second group project was the Ember project.

#### Weather Forecast
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mziccardi/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

  in this project we were tasked with using a geo location api that gets the users current location and to make api calls based on zip code as well. this project focused on learning redux. We learned about actions, reducers and containers and how to deal with larger react apps.

  Specification Adherence

  4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
  Redux Architecture

  4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
  Routing

  4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
  JavaScript Style

  3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
  2: ALMOST A 2.
  Testing

  2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
  Workflow

  4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

  from DAN: Mike Z, what a champ. stays up late and wakes up early, always troubleshooting bugs and issues. Keeps moral high and the stress low. Possibly sucks at testing, but we have that in common. We'll call that a shared growth opportunity!
  from NOAH: Mike was one of the best partners I had. I really felt like our learning curve was about the same and when Mike would grasp a concept before me he was happy to help, and when the same thing happened to me he was able to grasp the concept quickly. He was always willing to get what was needed done, and even when something was super frustrating or difficult he'd just keeping pounding away at it. Mike is an excellent programmer, teammate, and friend. Also he kills it at Redux.


#### RemEMBER
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mziccardi/1610-remember-4)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

Remember is an app where users can create reminders for themelves. this project helped us to learn MVC frameworks and to get better at a real style work flow of prs and comments on them.

Mike, I had fun working on the Ember project with you because our personalities are very similar and we both have such a dry sense of humor. I really enjoyed working through the flow of the project and switching off between issues. We talked out loud a lot during this project which was really great for my learning. You helped me a lot trying to figure out how to set upstream stuff for the repos and you got stuff rendering on the page after a half a day of being unable to do during our first set of issues, which was super frustrating. And also our jokes were on point!

## D: Professional Skills
 - Profession Development is beneficial in module 3. I enjoyed learning about how to figure out what I want in a job and what is important for me. Now I have a better understanding of what i want and where i want to be when i grow up(graduate)  
 
### Gear Up
#### (commons )

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/mziccardi/4eb6a8100129db6e9238ed3617486a9b)

  diversity is important in order to get different types of thought in the team environment

### Gear Up
#### (automation)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown))

automation is pretty cool but it is scary that almost every job can someday be automated. Its important to be informed about this so we can figure out a way for the folks who lose their jobs to get educated to have a job when theirs gets automated.  

### Gear Up
#### (basic income)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown))

 UBI gear up goes along with the automation gearup. once everybodys jobs get taken by robots, its important to find a way for humans to keep making ends meet. Its tough to say what will fix it, but it's important to thing about it


### Professional Development Workshops

Trello(you're already apart of it but here is a link anyway)

https://trello.com/b/a1c8UI8d/mike-ziccardi-company-tracking

Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):  I'm going to focus mainly on module 4 curriculum and to continue working on my personal project from module 3 to keep skills in React and Redux.

Opportunities Research:

I have been utilizing my trello board by searching for companies and then look at the company on linked in and look for software developer who works there, and reach out to them to ask about coffee meetups or gchat meetings.

Cold Outreach/Network:

I have joined the seattle alum slack channel and have been introduced to a few turing grads who are currently in the PNW. When looking at companies, if there is a turing grad working there, I reach out to them first.

Timeline:

I will be doing assignments as they are assigned. Trying to dedicate 4 hours a week to job search, cold outreach, coffee dates etc..

Module Tasks:

I will mostly be focused on working on assignments and trying to stay on top of the work and to not get overwhelmed by not getting work done

Weekly Tasks:

I want to try to get to more meetups. They make me feel a little uncomfortable, but i know how important they are for networking.

What I Will Work on with Meg

I want to work on cover letter stuff.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

-Devin:
I had a great time working with Devin on the RemEMBER project. I appreciate how patient you were patient when I was having trouble conceptualizing one of the issues we were given. You were easy to communicate with both in person, and over slack. If we were planning on meeting up you communicated when you would be there and were on time and that is greatly appreciated. The work flow of this project made me more comfortable with PRs and working on issues. Writing jokes in our tests made the project less boring and I even had some fun. Why does a chicken coop only have two doors???? IF IT HAD 4 IT WOULD BE A CHICKEN SEDAN!!

-DAN:
Working with dan on the weather forecast project was great. He made the sadness of learning Redux more fun by implementing a secret code into the app. Dan was always ready to work on the next parts of functionality, and was always ready to help when Noah or I was having any problems with our assigned parts. One important thing I learned from Dan was to "NEVER FORK THE REPO" just clone it down and make a separate repo so making PRs isn't as awful.

-NOAH:
I really enjoyed working with Noah. His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into small speed bumps during our time working on redux. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. We would work for long stretches and Noah would help remind me to take a break. the long stretches of coding would cause us to have worse focus and not get much progress. Noah has really been killing it lately and iâ€™m happy to be in class with him
