# Michael Ziccardi - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Mod 4 was a disaster for me and I did not enjoy any bit of it. I started off super confused with node and express. It hurt my confidence early in the mod and it was hard to bounce back from that.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Working on BYOB by myself was okay. It was a good project to help learn some of this back end stuff, but it was poor timing. I missed 2 days due to a family emergency, and didn't get as far as i would have liked. The instructors for mod 4 were super helpful in letting me get my things done after the due date, and letting me fix the broken pieces of a majority of my work.

Jet Fuel Submission form


Mike wants to shout out to Anna and Alex. Anna was very patient with me while I was/am struggling with wrapping my head around a lot of these concepts. she was this groups MVP. Thanks for being awesome Anna. Thanks to Alex for the early morning help and trying to help me understand these things.

##### feedback from Anna

Annastasia Psitos ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·  
Feedback: I enjoyed working with you on Jet Fuel. Iâ€™m sorry that I wasnâ€™t able to explain things well enough for you to understand earlier in our project. But Iâ€™m really proud of you for pushing through and working really hard on this project. You definitely understood what we were doing by the end of the project which is great!

Specification Adherence

40 points: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
All functionality was met except for the following:

Can only sort in one direction (not both ASC and DESC for both date and popularity).
User Interface

12 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
The application is easy to use and looks fairly decent. The improvements I would like to see is the URL table. The table could be better layed out with more space, the created date could be formatted better to be more human readable, and I would like to less white space.

The Folder list is also kind of a hot mess once it get's past 4 or 5 folders. It's hard to read the grey text on light blue background.

Data Persistence with SQL Database

20 points - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.
Testing

12 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
All endpoints are tested but only for happy path. No unit tests.

JavaScript Style

15 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
I really liked how you broke out your client-side code into really small, single responsiblity functions and had comments describing them. I would have liked to seen the DOM appending in it's own functions as well (displayUrls...).

Server-side code looks good for the most part. I would delete those app.locals at the top so you don't get confused if you are using them or not. Also, NO CONSOLE.LOGS IN PRODUCTION CODE!! EVER!!!!

Workflow

20 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Lots and lots and lots of commits and branches. Looking through the commits it looks like Anna did a majority of them, which is fine because Mike you indentified that and called it out.

Projects are due on Friday 3/17, 12:00 p.m. We will provide a submission form for all teams to submit their repos.

Project is worth 150 points with 15 extra points possible

To get a 3 on this project, you need to score 110 points or higher

To get a 4 on this project, you need to score 135 points or higher

Final Score: 119 / 150


### BYOB

#### ORIGINAL-> Thanks to the instructors who let me get it finished and passing.
Instructor Feedback

Points: 65 / 150
Endpoints

Do you know what might be happening with your patch endpoints that is causing them to be so problematic?

Notes: 3 Put/Patch endpoints present but broken. 2 Custom endpoints missing

10 points (60 - 10)

Data Persistence with SQL Database

40 points - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

Testing

12 passings tests - 3 tests failing - 19 tests missing

Notes: You can avoid repeating this before block by having all of your tests wrapped in a top level describe('Server'... with that beforeEach in it - that top level will touch all tests

0 points

JavaScript Style

Notes: All code lives in the server file - server code is much easier to break out, would like to see some logic broken into separate files.

Code formatting is off in multiple places. See example

Otherwise, code is in good shape and is using best practices!

15 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.



### ColorDrop
* [ColorDrop](https://github.com/mziccardi/colorPicker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

Blog Post (45 Points - 15 points per post)

JavaScript Style (40 points)

35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
User Interface (10 points)

7: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
Can't select color in top left where the color zone is.

Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/developers will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
Workflow (20 Points)

18: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches. Your team uses Waffle effectively to create small, single functionality user stories that are assigned to team members.
Better commit titles, more consistent use of Waffle

Extensions (20 points each)

Developer packaged their application for distribution aka you can send me a zip folder with your app and I can use it on my computer.

To get a 4, you need to achieve 160 points

To get a 3, you need to achieve 130 points

Final Score - 165 / 175



### Adopt Fund

##### Feedback
-Lauren Pesce
* Mike and I have never worked together on a project until mod 4, where I was lucky enough to work with him on two projects in a row! He is one of the most caring team players Iâ€™ve ever had the opportunity to work with and I truly enjoyed our time together. Mike is very practical and is a problem solver. Whenever I needed help or came to him with a problem, there was no hesitation to help me out and work on it until it was solved. Our Electron app was definitely a challenge for both of us, but I felt good knowing I had Mike on my team for support and we ended up with a pretty cool color picking app. While working on AdoptFund, Mike was willing to work on whatever needed to be done and accomplished those tasks very well and efficiently.  Mike was definitely one of my favorite people to work with!

-Noah Peden
* Working with Mike in Mod 4 after learning Redux with him Mod 3 was awesome. Being able to see his growth from front end to full stack developer has been a privilege for me.  His and I's learning curve is always on the same path and his attitude when it comes to working evenings and weekends is incredible. I can't wait to see where he lands after Turing because no matter what he might think, he knows a lot, and can do even more in the tech world.

-Josh
* Mike Z was great to work with on the Capstone project. Aside from providing comic relief when things got stressful, he was a spectacular communicator. If something wasnâ€™t clear to him, he wasnâ€™t afraid to reach out for help. He was very clear about his intentions and always followed through with what he said he would accomplish.

-Chelle
* Mike and I have gotten to work together in the past and this is no different than last time:  I love this dude.  His drive is one that cannot be matched.  He works until he understands exactly how something works and then is able to implement it immediately.  My only recommendation would be that he not be so hard on himself!  Heâ€™s an outstanding individual and programmer and itâ€™s disheartening to see his lack of confidence.  I wish Mike the absolute best and know someone with his ambition is gonna make it damn far in this field.

### Giving Feedback

- ANNA:
Working with anna was a real joy. We worked together on JetFuel and I had absolutely no idea what was going on. She was the real MVP. She was patient with me when i was slow to understand what was going on when building an api. She works incredibly hard and has become a very strong developer. Thanks for being patient with me Anna. I'm sorry It took until after the project was due to really start to understand node. You're awesome!

-CHELLE:
 Adopt fund was the second time I worked with Chelle, and it was just as good the second time as it was the first. She is a great developer and really knows how to keep the team focused on the task at hand. She was helpful and patient when I was struggling to figure out problems and was able to explain things in a way that I could understand. Chelle is an awesome programmer and I know she's going to find a Job quickly doing what she's doing. Keep it up Chelle you're the best!

-DAN:
Working with dan on the Color Drop project was great. He made the sadness of learning electron more interesting by helping get us back into canvas. Dan was always ready to work on the next parts of functionality, and was always ready to help when Lauren or I  had any problems with our assigned parts.

-NOAH:
I really enjoyed working with Noah on Adopt Fund. His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into small speed bumps during our time working on redux, back ends, styling, and AWS S3. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. We would work for long stretches and Noah would help remind me to take a break. the long stretches of coding would cause us to have worse focus and not get much progress. Noah has really been killing it lately and i'm excited to keep working on Adopt fund with him and build it into something serious.

-LAUREN:
I had the pleasure of working with Lauren for TWO WHOLE PROJECTS this module. With our Electron app, Lauren was able to keep our spirits high when we were having problems with understanding electron and struggling with Canvas. I also got to work on the capstone project with Lauren. She was super helpful with answering many of my design and UI questions, since i'm not one with much of an eye for design. Lauren is super easy to work with and I appreciate her ability to work hard even when that burn out feeling is looming. You're awesome Lauren!

-JOSH:
Josh has been a great person to work with. he always manages to generate a positive attitude during the times we have worked together, especially during stressful times. he is also realistic about managing work and is able to understand well-balanced timeframes for completing features on projects. he will be an asset to any team in the future.
