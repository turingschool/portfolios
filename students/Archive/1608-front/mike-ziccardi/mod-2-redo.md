# Michael Ziccardi - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I decided to redo module 2 and i think that it was the right choice. Being able to focus on basic javascript and really start to understand React.js has helped me to gain some confidence and be able to feel like i'm contributing more in group projects.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

 The three big projects that we worked on this module were 2dobox pivot, shoot the breeze, and tier2 (networkerz)


#### 2do box pivot
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mziccardi/2DoBox_Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

  in this project we were tasked with taking a previously made application and pivot it to something else. it was hard to jump back into jquery and getting food poisoining on selenium testing day was a bit of a problem, but we did what we could.

  Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
Instructor:
Comments:
code has opportunities to refactor
beef up tests
some glimpses of great code! would like to see more.

3 spec deliverables missing.


Specification Adherence

1 - The application is missing * 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.

Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


Utilization of es6
2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.


Testing
1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Working with Mike is great, he’s patient and great at finding new ways to tackle complex problems. I especially enjoy taking a walk and discussing new approaches to problem solving. He & I share a strong standard for quality and I, with no doubt, see Mike as the backbone to many elegant design solutions.

#### Shoot The Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mziccardi/shoot-the-breeze-)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

shoot the breeze is an instant messaging app using firebase and react.

Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot-the-breeze
Instructor: Meeka
Comments:
Make it so it is atleast usable in responsive (FIXED DAY OF)

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Component Architecture

3.5 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application (aside from logging in).
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints
Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

 MIKE ZICCARDI  Mike is the IDEAL collaborative partner.  He insists on clean code, thorough research, and presents himself in a cool, collected way that encourages growth from himself and others( meaning me, in this instance, of course).  Communication was a breeze, as Mike was always quick to respond which allowed for us to be on the same page at all times.  Additionally, Mike was able to show me some things that I wasn't privy to, such as breaking out testing components.  He's patient, positive, and demands only the best from himself.  I work would with Mike again in a heartbeat.  We put out a chat app that I'm proud to have completed with him as my partner.

#### FIRE BAE (NETWRKR)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/networkr)

4 - Zero complaints

I thought you were also a great partner to work with.  This was a tough project and I think I probably introduced some complexity early on that was tough for both of us to work through - I definitely have learned a few things on that front through this project. Despite our challenges, I really appreciated the positive/optimistic tone you gave our work together and hope you’ll continue to grow that strength.  Having worked on a number of teams in my past life, I can tell you that optimism and positivity is an incredibly important skill set to have in team work. Cheers!

## D: Professional Skills

 - learning project management was beneficial in module 2 i enjoyed learning about scrums and scrum cycles. while i feel that our projects arent big enough (yet) to implement these skills, it's good to know about AGILE and things like that, especially after looking at job postings and how AGILE is required knowledge for many developer positions

### Gear Up

#### (micro-aggressions)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I’ve known about many of the micro aggressions that are listed and many of them make sense to me. In the third article that talks about what is said, and translates it to what it means really shows what it means. Many of them I agree with that this is a problem with what is being said.

### Gear Up
#### (grit)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain? it is possible to interpret the experience but it may be a little skwed. Looking back on projects that were difficult seems hazy. you push through the shitty parts and get the thing done, but it's hard to see what you've learned until you need to do it 10 more times

Is that lens helpful? experience is helpful. pushing through and finishing what you start is what is important

Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)? grit isn't pushing through when you need a break. grit is taking that break and coming back to think of the same problem in a different way.

rethinking to try to be more filled with purpose, to me is not grit. grit is getting things done when frustrated/ hazy and being open enough to be able to learn and use what youve learned in future


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)
Hi meg!

for the cold out reach i have emailed Parick Martin who is a developer at Sphero up in boulder. I'm still waiting to hear back from him to set a meeting to chat about the industry over coffee. I have also reached out to Adam Porter at Cochlear  I have been chatting with him over email, and have set up a time to chat in person with him over intermission. My third  outreach is a developer who I recently met through some friends while visiting the bay area. I have been talking with him over email as well as google hangouts.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

  -Andy:  [10:34 AM]
working with Andy on the 2dobox pivot was an experience. Andy was patient as we had to dig into some old code from module 1. Since it had been so long since either of us had looked at Jquery it was a bit of a slow start. Andy works hard and is able to grind until we get something working, or until we run out of time.

  -Chelle:

  -Sam: I really enjoyed working with Sam His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into  speed bumps during our time working on firebae. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. He was patient when I would get lost in our mess of components and I really appreciated it. One thing that I feel would be beneficial to sam is to take more breaks. for me the long stretches of coding would cause me to have worse focus and not get much progress. sam has really been killing it, and i'm happy to be in class with him.
