## A: End of Module Assessment

### Specification Adherence
3+ All requirements done with minimal guidance
- 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
- 3 - The application includes all of the major functionality. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


### Determining the right tools for the job
- 3 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not utilize them as efficiently as possible; demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used.

### Following Documentation
- 4 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Did not need instructor guidance on how to work with the endpoints.

##### Petals
###### My favorite people to work with
- Places I have worked so far in my life : Nowhere serious
- Kinds of people from column one who I did not enjoy working with and why: No one and no reason
- Kinds of people I want to work with and be around : People that I admire and respect
- Kinds of people I want to serve in my industry : People who want to be treated with dignity
1. I prefer to float at parties. No point in limiting oneself. I contain multitudes
2. I prefer to float at parties. No point in limiting oneself. I contain multitudes
3. I prefer to float at parties. No point in limiting oneself. I contain multitudes

###### Transferable Skills
1. To earn a promotion from a program I was required to submit a portfolio with project scores, feedback, and professional development parameters. My goal was to complete the portfolio as honestly and quickly as I could so that I could return to, as is my prerogative as someone incurring debt to fund this program, activities that could more directly aid my ability to become financially independent and begin my career. The obstacle was the mental exhaustion caused from considering how long the portfolios took to complete relative to the time that was spent on reviewing them. What I decided to do, step by step, was to write my consciousness in full. The outcome will be determined sometime in the near future, but the benefits to my mental health are immeasurable
2. As my story shows, I can... [1. Follow Through, get things done; 2. Motivate; 3. Heal, cure; 4. Assess, evaluate, treat; 5. Serve, care for, follow instructions faithfully; 6. Use my intuition; 7. Think critically; 8. Prioritize; 9. Solve Problems; 10. Control, expedite things]

###### My values and goals
1. The Mind: I strive every day to think broadly and deeply about subjects that interest me. Something that I feel is very important is that no one ideology has a monopoly on good ideas or bad ideas and to consider an argument flawless is a lack of will to see its flaws. It is not recommended (the world is a much simpler place to navigate with a consistent outlook on the world) but there are distinct advantages to being an ideological chameleon and at this point in my life I wouldn't have it any other way
2. The Body: I want to be as healthy as I can while thinking as little about nutrition as possible. My goal is for my soul to guide my mind as to what is the best route at any given moment. The key is trusting that my soul is correct. It requires years of calibration, but the reward is peace of mind
3. The Eyes and Other Senses: I love music. Going to a concert of a band that people *really really* care about (i.e. people get band name tattooed to their derriere, etc) is effectively funding group therapy sessions that I would argue are more important / more effective than actual therapy, for many. I highly value artists that take creative risks or serve an audience that *needs* their work, and will strongly support those artists in the ways I can (mostly by buying records and going to their shows). I also love film dearly. Roger Ebert was described films as machines of empathy and I have never forgotten that description. Nothing can evoke emotions in me like being manipulated by a good film
4. The Heart: Ultimately, we're all in this together. If I can do anything to decrease divisiveness in this country, I hope I will make it my life's purpose
5. The Will or the Conscience: I do want to increase Social Justice in this world. But what I do not admire are people who pay lip service to Social Justice without paying any attention to the optics. If being honest is my crusade it is a cross I am willing to die on
6. Entertainment: I hope to enrich the lives of those around me every day. If I could find an outlet to perform or otherwise flex some smile-inducing talent, I will do so
7. The Earth: Our greatest responsibilities are to: those who brought us into this world, those who we see and touch everyday, the planet which we stand on, and those who are less fortunate than us. Sometimes care for one group comes at the expense of another group, but I seek to live my life considerate of all of those factors in any major decision I make. It is not easy to care for any of those groups, all anyone can do is do our best to positively influence what we can control

###### Preferred places to live
- Places I have lived: Suburban Atlanta; Northampton, MA; Charlottesville, VA; Asheville, NC; Denver, CO
- Factors I disliked: All of the places I have lived have been wonderful for the exact moment in time I was living there
- Translating the negatives into positives: The only negatives about those places was that I was not financially independent. If I were to be gainfully employed, my life would have been different. But it is a different calculus when one is paying for oneself, those places were wonderful places to live in part because of how much I could do without an income
- Ranking the positives: I didn't really list any positives because the last column was worded in such a way where it did not fit in context. What I do value is novelty and experiencing all of the wonderful people and culture that makes this country the best place in the history of time to live as a human (despite (or maybe because of??) the best/worst efforts of our chief executives)
- Austin, TX; Seattle, WA; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Lexington, KY; San Diego, CA; Durham, NC; Nashville, TN; Albuquerque, NM; Denver, Co [...]

###### My preferred pay and level of responsibilities
- In an ideal job I would be a partner in the top decision-making role of a company with few employees and billions of dollars under management
- I am aiming for a salary commensurate with the value I bring to an organization. No more, no less
- The rewards I would hope for in a new career outside of money would be the ability to work with and for people that I would be willing to risk my life for in the context where our lives were in danger. Though we are just tiny pebbles in floating in the sands of time, it would give my life meaning

###### My favorite working conditions
- Places I have worked so far in my life : Nowhere serious
- Column A: I have learned in my past that my effectiveness is decreased when I have to work under these conditions... (1) When I am not working for a team that I care about or (2) a cause that I do not believe in or (3) activities that should not be compulsory are treated as compulsory
- Column B: Ranking of the items in Column A in order of increasing dislike ... (3) (2) (1)
- Column C: I believe my effectiveness would be at a maximum if I worked under these conditions... I am working for a team that I care about and I cause I believe in and activities that should not be compulsory are treated as such

###### Most valued knowledges/fields of interest
1. I have not had a (serious) previous job
2. I am a generalist and know a little about a lot. A life goal of mine is to appear on Jeopardy
3. Industries that sound interesting to me are jazz club ownership and steel drum manufacturing
4. I am a curious person and will always want to learn in the future. However thinking about predictions I would have made in the past about the relative future, I would have been very off, for the most part, so to me there is not much value in making a prediction that will most likely be untrue

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

Ian: "Alex was a great partner to work with for the reminders project. Learning ember while also adhering to a structured pull request workflow was challenging in ways that I think neither of us expected. That said, we worked very effectively by individually tackling issues but still maintaining a tight communication loop. We ended up with a some merge conflicts and a couple of different version of the app, but facing these challenges was easy working with Alex. He always kept his cool and kept the project moving forward. One thing I think Alex could work on is coding speed. Alex’s approach and and knowledge of the code seems on point which makes me think he could be a much faster coder."

### Playing a Part

- willing to make a fool of myself
- being a good roommate
- helped several Mod 2 students at various points throughout the module
- was part of a sustaining group of those who participated in Friday afternoon culture
- attended Productivity Lunch regularly

### Gear Up

### Gear Up
#### Micro-aggressions
- I learned that my group was eager to criticize the notion that "Turing has a mission-critical responsibility to create a culture in which the messages behind microaggressions are consistently named and challenged." In particular, our group was critical of the idea that a culture of naming and challenging microaggressions is progressive  

#### Journey Mapping  
- I was glad to have been grouped with Mike, Noah, and Susi on this Journey Mapping Gear Up. We had a wonderful discussion of the experience of playing a game of Monopoly and most of us agreed that we were very happy to have had such a discussion in the context of the week and our time at Turing

#### Grit
- I was extremely pleased that Nate was our Gear Up lead for talking about Grit. I was also pleased to have had a discussion with Nick and Hillary about what our goals were and how important goals are as a functional input to how gritty one can be
