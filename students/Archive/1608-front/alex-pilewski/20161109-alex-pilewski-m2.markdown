##### Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot the breeze
##### Instructor: Jhun
##### Comments:
- great architecture
- would look into breaking large function in messagefield out
- look into stubbing tests.

##### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Component Architecture

* 4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

##### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### 10/7 Voting
- I learned that I enjoy Susi's company and I am happy she gave me one of her knit coozies as I use it just about every day. It reminds me of the very funny / personal conversation we had about how to be (and when not to be) honest with one's children.

#### 10/21 Introversion
- I can't say I was surprised that the convesation between Nick, Kinan, Mike, and myself was a memorable one, but it is rare that people are given opportunities to talk in a group of like-minded peers about how to value solitude. I am very glad to have had the discussion with those men.

#### 11/4 Resilience
- I was very glad that the Resilience repo prominently featured Ed Harris from Apollo 13. I remember the first year of the George W. Bush presidency my family went together to Best Buy to purchase our first DVD player. When my dad asked the clerk for recommendations what should be the first film that we watch together as a family, the clerk suggested Apollo 13. It was great advice and I remember watching that film as a family very fondly.

### Company Tracker
- I have made personal connections with companies in Boston (Price Intelligently), Charlottesville (WillowTree), DC/World (ICF International) and Atlanta (Yik Yak).

### Project Management Reflection
- I find that I struggle to maintain enthusiasm for using tools like Trello or Waffle. I have yet to be a part of a project where using Trello or Waffle improved the workflow of myself or the group. I find regular, honest communication is the most important thing a group can do to stay on task and productive. Without it, prioritizing efforts is a fool's errand.

- The most important feedback I see is body language. It is far more telling than any feedback I have received prior, after, or during a project. I have also learned a lot about myself this module but as someone who prefers to keep my personal introspection private I don't believe it's worth sharing in a public repo.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Andrew: "Working with Andrew for the ideaBox pivot project after our first break from Module 1 was a great experience but it also featured its share of challenges. Those challenges primarily stemmed from how our personalities enabled the less-productive sides of each other. However, that same chemistry led to Karaoke Wednesdays... which not only ended up being extremely memorable but I would argue is more responsibe for bringing our cohort closer together than any attempt at community building Turing attempts to do on Fridays. Indeed, I would give Andrew as much or more credit towards building the cohort culture as anyone else in the module. It's the culture that is responsible for motivating us all to spend so much time with each other working extremely hard, which after a slow start I believe was the same for Andrew and myself on the ideaBox pivot. I would trust that if we were to work together again we would make for a solid team and I would certainly endorse Andrew's approach solving problems / being a web developer."

Maia: "I very much enjoyed working with Maia on Weathrly. I thought we had a great mental approach to the project, it being an ungraded project definitely allowed us to take our time diving into tutorials that semi-inadvertently deepend our understanding for how webpack worked in addition to making our first React App a much less painful experience. I would love to work with Maia again in the future, if only to put a real API into the weather app for our portfolios!"

Mike: "Working with Mike on our pseudo-budget app was a great experience. Though our app proved rather difficult to take from ideation to execution I found Mike to be a very willing and capable contributor. I don't think Mike gives himself enough credit for what he does know and should feel more confident in his ability to solve problems. Speaking for myself, I know it was difficult to manage what to prioritize on our app, but knowing where the app started and where it went over one weekend I am certain given a few more days we could have made the app 3x better than it currently stands."

Nick: "Working with Nick on shoot-the-breeze was a distinct pleasure. I found it was easily the most painless workflow of the module. We never lost days to due to being unproductive and it is definitely a testament to Nick's foresight that we had some strategic pairings to keep us on track throughout the week(s). I believe we paired together for just about the entirety of the project and I thought we had a really nice rapport when working through the more difficult pieces of logic / debugging. I really don't have any sort of constructive criticism because Nick is a diligent worker and fine collaborator, just about everything you could ask for in a pardner. In addition to  all of that Nick is a meme for a reason."

Chelsea: "Working with Chelsea on our pseudo-budget app was a great experience. Though our app proved somewhat difficult to take from ideation to execution I found Chelsea to be a very strong collaborator with many great ideas/opinions/perspective on designing our app/component architecture/design/you-name-it. Also Chelsea's bouncing basketball animation on the sign in page I think proved to be the best, well-functioning part of our app. Speaking for myself, I found it was somewhat hard to always know what our working priorities are, but I think that was the nature of working on an app unmoored by specifications as well as the difficulty of managing the mental energies of a three-person group. That being said, I would be happy to work with Chelsea on any future project :)"

### Being a Community Member

Nick: "Working on Shoot-the-Breeze with Alex was a real good time. His technical abilities are strong, he's good at finding solutions quickly, and our personalities jived well. The entire process was generally free of stress, and we kept on the same page by reviewing our Waffle page twice daily.  We sought help when we needed it, paired with students in higher modules than us, and worked through many of the technical problems as a duo. It was a solid learning experience, and I was impressed by the way Alex approaches coding. One suggestion I would make to him would be to logically break down and pseudo code before diving in to writing it. There were a few times when Alex would tackle a problem by beating it into submission with complicated logic and code. I think this is a great quality for coming up with a solution and achieving functionality, but a couple times it led to some unwieldy code. This could totally be remedied by either refactoring or taking more time to plan out a simpler solution ahead of time. No matter what, I was always impressed by his logic and had a great experience working with him."

Maia: "It was a pleasure working with you, Alex.  I'm glad we got to work together on an "ungraded" project, because we really took the time to learn the concepts and had interesting discussions around UI/UX.  I really appreciate you answering any questions I had about the work you did.  My only suggestion would be to try forcing yourself to explain your thoughts and steps better when you are pairing, and if you do jump ahead and do work on your own, to make that clear with your partner, and make sure to go over what you did thoroughly.  All in all it was great teamwork, and I'm happy with our app - although we need to put in the real API!! I'd happily work with you again anytime."

Mike: "Working with Alex on FireBae AKA BetsketBall was great. Since i’m not a huge sports fan, Alex had to explain the basics of sports betting and all of the things to think about when betting on a winning team .  We had some tough logical problems to think through and alex never lost sight of the problem to solve. it was hard for me to follow along with some of the logic but alex never stopped trying to explain what we were attempting to do."

Chelsea: "I enjoyed being able to work with Alex on our budget/betting app. I don't think I'm a great risk taker. Alex's passion and risk taking drive are admirable and pushed me out of my comfort zone on this project. Alex's idea to do a betting app allowed our group to flex our skills, work on challenging problems, and try new ways of thinking. Alex is hilarious and always willing to listen to other people on the team's ideas. This was my first time in a group of three so I think it was a little difficult to know what each of us was working on, how to divide work and what our next steps should be. So I think we could have used more organization of our tasks. Overall, I had a great experience working with Alex, would love to collaborate on another project, and work to refine our app."

Andrew: "Working with Alex is what I imagine it would be like working with the ‘me’ from a parallel universe. The difference being that he’s much quicker to work through logic, more comfortable with syntax and his humor is more creative. Alex is able to balance productivity with an enjoyable working atmosphere. I’d argue that the balance was perfect, but being paired with me probably through off the natural harmony that he seems to have achieved between the two. I think Alex could benefit from slowing down just a bit more to explain a complicated chunk before moving to the next problem. That said, he was never impatient to explain anything - it was just explained at the speed with which he thinks, which is a bit faster than my speed of thinking. I’m ready to pair with him in Mod 3 and hope we’re able to do so."
