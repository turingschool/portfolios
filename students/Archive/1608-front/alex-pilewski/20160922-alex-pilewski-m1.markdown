# Alex Pilewski - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wrote in my goals gist from the beginning of the module that I would like a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQUERY. Whatever 'solid foundation' really means is a matter of perspective but I feel good about how much I have learned thus far. I also mentioned that I would like to work on a D3 side project, familiarize myself with good workflows, and start building a tech network. On all of those fronts (some more than others) there have been steps in the right direction.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 4 evaluated projects this module. In order of completion: number-guesser, linked-list, idea-box, and game-time. There was also one un-evaluated project, color-changer.

**number-guesser**
* https://github.com/Pilewski/number-guesser

- Three button interface game that checks if a user guesses a randomly generated number.

**Evaluation**

**Functional Expectations**
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

**Fundamental JavaScript Style**
2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

**jhun notes:** Strong effort towards writing good javascript. Some opportunities to refactor and reuse code. Would be beneficial for devs to go back and refactor with a mentor.

***

**linked-list**
* https://github.com/Pilewski/linked-list

- Application with two input fields that adds bookmarks to a page.
- Bookmarks feature the title, URL, and buttons to "mark as read" and "remove".

**Evaluation**

**Functional Expectations**
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

**HTML Style**
4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

**CSS Style**
4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

**Fundamental Javascript Style**
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

**Workflow**
4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**jhun notes:**
developers are referencing the document multiple times
could refactor to use closures
good solid effort.
great workflow! Bazillion commits for the win!
no globals for the win!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Maia:
Maia is the bomb. Always exudes kindness and joy (even when she has not had her morning cup of joe!) I relish the opportunity to pick her brain and we have had great conversations about the communities we belong to and our responsibilities to them. Very gracious with her attention and I imagine I would enjoy being paired with Maia on any  project!

Feedback to Kinan:
Kinan was a fantastic member of the cohort and the larger Turing community. Always brings a calm demeanor to the proceedings and did a great job kicking off our group retros. It is obvious Kinan is a very intentional listener and I am certain I would enjoy being paired with him on any project. A+

Feedback to Dale:
Dale has been a wonderful, wonderful member of the cohort. He is extremely gracious with his time and has helped countless members of our group with git issues time and again. It is easy to notice his excellent work temperament that helps make problem solving and collaboration frictionless. I would be delighted to be paired with Dale on any project.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Kristen:
I was incredibly lucky to work with Alex on our first project of the module, Number Guesser. He is an exceptional student of this trade that works hard to master the craft of writing code. Alex had such a stronger grasp on the workings of Javasript than I did at this early point in the program, and I cannot express enough how much I appreciated his patience with me throughout the project. Not only is he impressive as a student, he's also a great teacher. He painstakingly walked me through every line of code that was written, helping me establish my foundationional understanding of JavaScript. In additon to being a partner who is intelligent and insightful, Alex is also highly entertaining. Whether struggling through a problem in the code or explaining an overarching concept, his demeanor and verbiage is always engaging and delightful.  

Feedback from Matt:
Working with Alex on IdeaBox was a pleasure. He has a good knowledge of Javascript and is engaging to work with. Alex focuses well, was always on time, and overall super friendly. Our project went smoothly, we had good communication, and he helped me understand more git concepts that I didn't know before. I hope to work with Alex again in the future.

Feedback from Maia:
Alex is a wonderful member of our cohort.  He’s super smart, funny, and all around pleasant.  He’s willing to jump in and help others and really cares about our community.  His attitude is always positive, and he likes to engage in thoughtful meaningful discussion.  I really enjoy his presence and I look forward to getting to know him better, growing in the program and experiencing Turing together.

Feedback from Graham:
Alex was my partner for Linked List, the second team project of the mod. From day 1, we seemed to be on the same page; I found that my workflow with Alex was the best of all of my team experiences for the mod. Alex had a lot of insights and has a great sense of humor to boot. I hope we are paired up again in the future.

Feedback from Adam:
Alex and I were paired for the Gametime project. Alex is a very hard worker and great team player. He was willing to slowly breakdown any problems that he solved if I did not understand how he got to a solution. Alex does not get frustrated easily so it is easy to work with him.

Feedback from Kinan:
During the times we spoken during this module, Alex has always held the exact kind of enthusiasm you would want most during times of high stress. His ability to articulate complex social topics, cultural understandings, and current events translates well in tackling complicated technical problems. During our time together, he has held an open ear to many perspectives and is generally very pleasant to around! Alex has consistently presented himself as eager to learn and remain focused at a problem at hand. Overall, I can say Alex will be an asset to any team he ends up on and look forward to our future collaboration during Turing!

Feedback from Dale:
Alex is great to have in the cohort. He has a great sense humor that helps keep the group in a good mood. From my view, his technical skills are near the top of the class.  He has always been willing to help and to share his knowledge which I have benefited from.  I look forward to pairing with Alex in the future.  I just hope I can keep up with him.

### Playing a Part

Creation of Dale memes, willingness to make a fool of myself, willingness to teach and help others, commitment to growth mindsets, being a good roommate, and making deliberate choices.

## Final Review

### Notes

Feels good about building a solid foundation this module, as we agree.

Gives great positive feedback, but we encourage him to give good constructive critical feedback to help peers grow and improve.

Alex is a great member of this cohort and our Turing community and we’re excited to see how he grows over the next three modules.

Wants to be a part of building front end focused posses, step into a leadership role in the Turing community.

### Outcome

PASS
