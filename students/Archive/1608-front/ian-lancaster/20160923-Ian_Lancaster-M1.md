-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Bree
### Student: Ian Lancaster
### Notes:
Very good job at collaborating on different ways and ideas to approach the problem. Solid understanding of what's going on in the code at all times, along with a strong grasp of terminology and ability to write without having to constantly look things up. One area of improvement, which will increase efficiency, is finishing the step you are on. You did not quite complete the function you were writing before moving onto the next one. The functions were coupled, and you were great at letting me know what you were doing, but efficiency and ability to keep things straight could be increased if you reigned in the "bouncing around". Again - not drastic, just a minor nitpick that is worth being cognizant, so it doesn't become a debilitating habit.

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I completed the color changer and my personal portfolio site.

#### Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ianlancaster/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

Creation of a simple web page with two buttons. One that randomized the background color of the page when clicked, and one that reset the color to white.

#### Portfolio Site

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ianlancaster/personal-portfolio.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

A personal portfolio site to show off my projects and progress at Turing.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module I worked with a partner on multiple projects including the number guesser, linked list, ideabox, and gametime.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Creation of a game that generates a random number in a range, that a user then tries to guess. The game throws errors if the user does something that is invalid, and gets harder the more it is played. The game was all coded in vanilla JavaScript.

Specification Adherence: 3, User Interface: 4, JavaScript Style: 3, Workflow: 4

I really enjoyed working with Ian on number guesser because he is a really good teacher. Considering it was the first project, I looked to Ian for a lot of help because he had more experience. Ian did a really good job in letting me drive as he asked questions to help lead me to the correct solution. I look forward to working with Ian again.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kansasraptor/linkedListProject)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Creation of a one-page app that takes a website title and url then saves the elements onto the page as a bookmark. Created with JavaScript and jQuery.

Functional Expectations: 4, Fundamental JavaScript Style: 3, Workflow: 3, HTML Style: 4, CSS Style: 3

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ianlancaster/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

The ideabox was a simple application that took an idea name and description, stored it in local storage, and rendered the idea on the page. An idea was editable and had remove, promote quality, and demote quality buttons. The ideabox was written in JavaScript and jQuery and utilized object oriented methodologies.

Specification Adherence: 3, User Interface: 4

Ian and I worked on the IdeaBox project.  He was a couple of steps ahead of me on JavaScript skills but took
the time to walk me though and explain the where and why he was moving in a particular direction.  We had a great balance of pair and independent work time and were able to bring together our work effectively. Ian was
a solid pair and I look forward to working with him through our time at Turing.

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ianlancaster/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

We created a side scroller game much like the popular helicopter game. The game used object oriented javascript and HTML5 canvas to create a fish that moves up and down on keypress. The goal of the game is to dodge the incoming objects and eat bonus mushrooms. The game gradually gets harder over time, but will never be impossible.

Nice job guys! Some room for reorganizing classes. This would help testing be lest entangled. Overall, excellent job.

Functional Expectations: 4, User Interface: 4, Testing: 4, JavaScript Style: 3.5, Workflow 3, Code Sanitation: 4

Ian is super organized and a great team member. I learned a ton of cool workflow hacks from him. He knows his keyboard shortcuts and crushes productivity. Ian plans well, and I learned a lot from his up-front planning attitude, even if we diverged from the plans at some point during the project. Ian was really fun to work with and we had a great time working on our game. I'd love to have Ian on a team again in the future.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Hillary – Number Guesser
Hillary was great to work with on the number guesser project. We worked well together while pairing to create the HTML and CSS for the project. The JavaScript portion was a bit more challenging, but we fed off each other’s work to get to a final product. There was a bit of duplication of work with JavaScript, but that was ok because we both got to get reps in writing code, and ultimately merged our work into something greater than the individual parts. In hindsight, I wish we would have spent more time tackling the JavaScript together.

Dale – Idea Box
Dale was a pleasure to work with Dale for the Idea Box project. He had great insights as we worked on the project and was very receptive to me coaching him through parts of the code that we were having trouble with. We worked in an effective and collaborative manner for most of the project, but also effectively divided and conquered features toward the end.

Matt – Game Time
It was a lot of fun to work with Matt on Game Time. I was astounded at how quickly he could write code, diagnose problems, and get things working. There were many instances where we worked together in an effective and collaborative manner. That said, I frequently felt that I was just an observer of this project rather than a partner. The vast majority of the code written by Matt when we were together, and a lot more of it he wrote on his own. I will be spending a good portion of the interim period building a game of my own to ensure that I fully understand the concepts of the project.

### Being a Community Member

Ian is a great classmate. He is always positive and helpful if you have questions. -AR
