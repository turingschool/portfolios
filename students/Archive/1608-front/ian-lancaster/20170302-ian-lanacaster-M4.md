Excellent project Ian, great work.

## feedback to me

Feedback from Graham:

I had the privilege of working with Ian on two projects: the Electron project and our capstone. I had an excellent experience with both. I think that he may have been my best partner at Turing (nothing against any of the others), perhaps in part because we have similar personalities and work styles in many ways. He did a lot of wizardry with the server and the SVG, and he was super collaborative and helpful when we went through our build nightmares with React Native. In terms of code, I think he should work on writing shorter, more modular functions and breaking code into more files. Overall, though, it was a great experience working with Ian.

Feedback from Lacy:

It's been really great to see Ian's growth over the course of Turing. He is an incredibly sharp and highly motivated person, who enjoys sharing his perspective and knowledge with others. I've mostly been impressed with his ability and willingness to accept feedback, positive or negative, from others and actively work on changing. I think he had some occasional struggles with group work over the course of the 7 months, but by the end it was evident that he took that feedback to heart and became a really great teammate. I think Ian is going to go on to do great things, and main hope for him is that he continues with the same penchant for continual learning and growth.


Feedback to Graham:

Finally getting to work with Graham on a couple of project this mod was a true pleasure. I don’t think I have worked a more focused and diligent individual that Graham. I think he will be a true asset wherever he ends up working. Graham has found a method for writing and refactoring coded that end in a solid final product. My only, piece of advice for him would be to stop coding at certain key decision points, and consider the costs and benefits of different options. Doing this rather than taking the first path that works, could save a lot of development time down the road.

## Gear Up

### Tragedy of the commons:

This one one of the coolest visualizations of a complex topic that I have ever seen I have since showed this to multiple other people. I never knew how even a small bias could lead to such segregation over time. It may be a while until I am in a hiring position, but when I am I will seek diversity.

### Automation:

I am really glad that we did a spike on this topic, and would recommend Turing cycle it through every 4 mods so that every student is exposed to the topic. The automation of 20-60% of our workforce is going to be one of the great challenges of our generation. It was not surprising to see the pro automation bias among the Turing students, but however someone felt about automation we all agreed; it is happening.

### Universal basic income:

This was a great spike to have after automation. My automation group actually talked about UBI as a potential solution to the automation problem. I was surprised by the amount of opposition to UBI however. The ideal that you should work hard to be compensated still rings strong with many students, and some feel the UBI would endanger that value. I personally think the rise of automation will lead to unemployment levels that can only be solved by a program like UBI. Time will whether America will accept the idea or not.

## Professional Development

I completed all professional development requirements and have been cleared by Meg. Rather than sending out the cold emails, I proposed the plan below.

Outbound:
* ✅	Prepare lead pool
  * ✅	Identify prospects. Looking to join product team for marketing tool company. Wrote a node app that scraped the company info of 800+ marketing apps off of GetApp.
  * ✅	Prioritize and organize prospects into buckets based on category and matched project. Scraped app category off of GetApp, and scraped Alexa traffic and trend data in order to prioritize and bucket.
*	Repeat following process for each bucket (1st bucket SEO/SEM tools)
  *	Complete bucket project (free smb ranking tracker powered by Google Search Console)
  * ✅	Identify potential warm intros and feed into CRM (Using the free HubSpot CRM)
  * ✅	Identify potential cold email targets and feed into CRM
  * ✅	Compile basic company and opportunity info and feed into CRM
  *	Reach out to network for warm intros
  *	Send cold email
  *	Add targets MAS (phase out over time)

Inbound: (Using Wordpress site as CMS and HootSuite as MAS)
*	Identify most ideal projects and content to attract potential employers
*	Identify and mitigate potential land mines
*	Create content production calendar
*	Implement CMS / CRM / MAS. Conversion optimize site.
*	Set up lead forensics & site analytics for tracking and follow up

Acronyms:
* CRM - Customer Relationship Management system
* CMS - Content Management System
* MAS - Marketing Automation System
* SEO - Search Engine Optimization
* SEM - Search Engine Marketing
