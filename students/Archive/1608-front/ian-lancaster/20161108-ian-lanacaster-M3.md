# Ian Lancaster - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I had a few different areas that I sought to focus on. Using documentation and self-reliance when learning something new was an important emphasis. I also wanted to work on filling in the gaps in my knowledge when it comes to production applications. My work this mod with node, express, and redux has greatly widened my understanding. I also wanted to spend some time away from class focusing on application design and prototyping. The invison prototype of my personal project was the results of my efforts.

Moving forward I am going to be focusing much more on searching for a job, refining my pairing and teamwork skills, and mastering the fundamentals and design patterns of JavaScript.

We The People is an app that makes keeping up with congress and voicing your opinion on legislation easy and meaningful. Enter in your voting address to identify your representatives, then choose categories of legislation that you care about. View all of the bills proposed by congress and track them along their journey to becoming law. Follow a bill that you are especially invested in to receive notifications when the bill's status changes. Easily and effectively voice your opinion about a bill by using the bill's 'take action' button. The best representative to contact about a bill will change depending on the status of the bill. The 'take action' button does the hard work for you by showing you which representative you need to contact and by offering multiple ways to contact the representative right from the app.

We The People is a concept app created in January of 2017 as Ian Lancaster's personal project for the Turing School of Front-End Engineering. The app is built using davezuko's react-redux-starter-kit and is powered by Firebase & the Sunlight Foundation API (now managed by Propublica). The web app was designed predominantly for mobile devices and uses redux to support an smooth transition to react native.

A rough interactive prototype of the application can be found at the link below. The prototype was created using sketch and invision.

### Projects

#### Weather Forecast

##### Overview:

In this project we built a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.

##### Main Goals:

- Retrieve and display forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Use the Geolocation API to determine the weather in your current city
- Save “pinned” or favorite cities to display their extended weather forecasts

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

##### Scores:

Specification Adherence: 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Redux Architecture: 4 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

Routing: 4 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

JavaScript Style: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing: 4 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

Workflow: 4 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

Troubleshooting: 4 - Most to all questions were posed to instructors with expected information

##### feedback to me


From Kinan:

Working with Ian on our first project was great. We had already familiarized with each other from our Module 2 first project, so the general understanding of how each other operates was there, and we definitely work well together. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Implementing features on a project is not problem for Ian. This is definitely his strong suit. During this project, he set an intention to slow down and allow other team members to drive the project, since he often knows the next direction and can easily get ahead of other team members. I would have to say he was very successful at this, and was available to collaborate and work on problems with smoothness. The only improvement I may suggest for Ian is to ensure ownership over a role. Although he met a goal to allow others to lead, he may have picked a particular area explicitly to focus on so that other team members are aware of where he is. I'm' sure this really only applies to the context of this project. I'll be happy to work with Ian in the future.

From Maia:

Working with Ian on our Weather App was great!  He had more experience writing Redux than the rest of us, and he did a great job at letting us drive, while gently steering us in the right direction. In hindsight, it would have been great if he had taken more time to pair with each of us individually on this project, because I certainly benefitted from his solid understanding of the code base and his help getting additional tests to pass.  I'm constantly amazing at how quickly Ian picks things up and how hard he works (seemingly effortlessly) to become a great developer.  I would be happy to work with Ian anytime.

From Kristen:

Ian was a tremendous asset for our group on the Weather Tracker project. He had a much stronger command of Redux going into this project than the rest of us, but he certainly did not let us use him as a crutch during the project. Ian really proved himself to be an excellent teacher in this project, and I was really impressed with how he would often guide us to an answer as opposed to just giving it to us. When he would explain difficult concepts to us, he was able to do so very effectively. Whether that meant walking through console errors or drawing out a picture, he made sure that all of us were on the same page throughout our Redux struggle. Thank you so much, Ian, and I hope we can work together again in Mod 4!

### Giving Feedback

To Alex:

Alex was a great partner to work with for the reminders project. Learning ember while also adhering to a structured pull request workflow was challenging in ways that I think neither of us expected. That said, we worked very effectively by individually tackling issues but still maintaining a tight communication loop. We ended up with a some merge conflicts and a couple of different version of the app, but facing these challenges was easy working with Alex. He always kept his cool and kept the project moving forward. One thing I think Alex could work on is coding speed. Alex’s approach and and knowledge of the code seems on point which makes me think he could be a much faster coder.

To Kristen:

I really enjoyed working with Kristen on the weather forecast project. She works effectively with teammates and is also very capable of crushing solo work. Kristen seems to be very comfortable with react and is a go-to resource when it comes to testing. One area I would encourage her to work on is styling, as it seems to eat more of her time than than is desired. Additional practice and repetition is an easy remedy.

To Kinan:

It was great to work with Kinan again on another project. Kinan was a key contributor in our group pairing sessions and was good at keeping the group on track and making sure we take breaks. I especially appreciate Kinan’s attention to detail and ‘see things through’ attitude. This was apparent when he spent a chunk of his weekend polishing the styles of the app and creating a better readme even after the project eval. One thing I think Kinan could work on is making his voice more heard. Kinan is relaxed, respectful, and a great listener but this often leads to others interrupting him and drowning out his voice.

To Maia:

I really enjoyed working with Maia on the weather tracker app. Maia is one of the hardest working individuals I have been partnered with, and it is obvious to me how that perseverance is making her a very capable developer. I thought that Maia was a great pairing partner when we worked on tests together and I would gladly work with her again.

### Gear Up

#### Microgressions
I enjoyed reading about microgressions. I was also surprised at what all was considered a microgression and how many people serve them without trying. I was in a group with 3 redheaded girls and learned that even the term 'ginger' could be a microgression.

#### Journey Mapping
Journey mapping is actually something that I am quite familiar with. It was a big par of my job at a marketing agency. I think the gear-up was run really well and the material was spot on. I also noticed how well the concept of the conversion funnel in marketing and the journey map worked together.

#### Grit
This usage of the term 'grit' was new to me. I enjoyed the perspective it gave and liked that the gear-up also included an article with an opposing stance. It is important to acknowledge that you will never be your best self running on talent and potential alone. Hard work and perseverance is just as if not more important. I personally believe that grit is closely tied to personal motivation.
