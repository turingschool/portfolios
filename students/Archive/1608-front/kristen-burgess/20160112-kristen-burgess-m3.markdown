#### Partner Feedback from Ian
* I really enjoyed working with Kristen on the weather forecast project. She works effectively with teammates and is also very capable of crushing solo work. Kristen seems to be very comfortable with react and is a go-to resource when it comes to testing. One area I would encourage her to work on is styling, as it seems to eat more of her time than than is desired. Additional practice and repetition is an easy remedy.

#### Partner Feedback from Kinan
* Working with Kristen on our first project was great. We had already familiarized with each other from our Module 2 capstone project, so the general understanding of how each other operates was there. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Communicating is no problem for Kristen. At times, I feel she really enjoys communicating, which is awesome, as do I, but some fluff and buff or filler talk could be reduced simply because of stressful and pressing time conditions while in Turing. This skill will become a great asset in the real, balanced world of software development. Kristen was also adamant about keeping in touch over individual progress over SLACK, which made our collaboration as a team more seamless. She was also sick during part of it, and truly did well completing her side of things considering the inherent loss of energy.

#### Partner Feedback from Maia
* It was a pleasure working with you again!  I love your positive attitude, and willingness to take on any challenge.  You contributed greatly to the project when we were all pairing, and on your own.  I do wish, since you took on the styling, that you had put in a bit more effort, or reached out for help, but also, since we weren't scored on that component, I can understand why it was more or less last on the priority list.  Overall, you are a great addition to our cohort and the community, and I look forward to another great mod ahead!

#### Partner: Chelsea Skovgaard

#### Partner Feedback from Chelsea
* I really enjoyed finally getting to work with Kristen on a project! She is wicked smart and always upbeat. I think when pairing she achieves a good balance between driving and listening, which I appreciated in a project partner. She is also knowledgable about testing. Concepts I had not previously fully grasped she explained and helped me implement for my self-directed project. I enjoyed working with Kristen and hope I get the chance again. Can't wait for her to explain the stock show as well as she explains testing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Maia on Weather Tracker
* I loved having the opportunity to work with Maia again on our first Redux project.
Maia is, as I've said before, a tenacious learner with an unparalleled work ethic. She fearlessly jumped into testing with Jest in this project, and while I wish I could have explored that with her, I was so impressed with her grasp on testing with Jest by the end of the project. Maia is very organized and is a great asset in facilitating the workflow of a project and keeping everyone in touch/on the same page. Maia can be very assertive at times, and this can sometimes be difficult for more laid back partners to work with, but overall, I think this is a positive quality and part of what makes Maia the rockstar she is :)

#### Feedback to Ian on Weather Tracker
* Ian was a tremendous asset for our group on the Weather Tracker project. He had a much stronger command of Redux going into this project than the rest of us, but he certainly did not let us use him as a crutch during the project. Ian really proved himself to be an excellent teacher in this project, and I was really impressed with how he would often guide us to an answer as opposed to just giving it to us. When he would explain difficult concepts to us, he was able to do so very effectively. Whether that meant walking through console errors or drawing out a picture, he made sure that all of us were on the same page throughout our Redux struggle. Thank you so much, Ian, and I hope we can work together again in Mod 4!

#### Feedback to Chelsea on remEMBER
* I have wanted to work with Chelsea since our first module, and it was so great to finally get that opportunity on the Ember project. Chelsea has such a positive attitude and exceptional communication skills, which were tremendously helpful for this project whose prime focus was a smooth workflow. Furthermore, I was out sick when my cohort was introduced to Ember, and Chelsea was able to get me up to speed and understanding the structure of an Ember app and our project in an hour over Sceenhero. Chelsea is great at debugging and problem solving, and I felt like between the two of us, we could work through any problem with little to no outside help.
My only constructive feedback is to not be afraid to call me (or anyone else) out when I'm being difficult or stubborn on working through a problem :) I truly hope we get to work together again in our final mod!


### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Dylan Avery, 1610-FE
* Kristen is such a helpful person to have at Turing, and I’m so glad for her. She reached out to me after she saw a tweet that I wrote while in distress. She recommended React Router 4 and helped me to install it and get it up and running. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without her! She is great at telling her “Turing Story” and it really helps me to put things in perspective as well. I look forward to pairing more with Kristen in the future!

#### Feedback from Verou Posse leads, Chelsea Skovgaard and Lacey Knaff
* When starting the Verou Posse, we joked that Kristen would be our "community liaison". But it was no joke. From bringing cookies to a posse meeting to volunteering to lead presentations, Kristen has been a great posse member and community participant. She also asks great questions during posse presentations and always has a positive and cheerful attitude. We are so happy that she joined our posse!

#### Gear Up Reflections Recap

When I think back on Gear Ups from this module, two discussions are most memorable: responsibilities of citizenship && introversion vs extroversion.
* I'm generally very enthusiastic about politics, and I have always made a point to promote political involvement and appreciation of our rights and responsibilities as American citizens. However, I'm very cognizant of the fact that there are many who don't appreciate these responsibilities or even give them much thought. The political climate of this country has been obscenely charged this year, but it was as important as ever to stay invested and involved in the process. We, in fact, saw an even lower level of voter turnout than in years past. Personally, I am very disappointed by this. However, through the discussion that took place at this Gear Up, I also have a higher level of empathy and understanding towards disenchanted voters who felt it was their right to not participate this year. American politics is a highly divisive subject, but I think it's so important to encourage intelligent and open conversation of the subject. I deeply appreciate Turing making a point to facilitate such a discussion.
* Although most people that know me would classify me as VERY extroverted, I would actually give myself more of a 60/40 split on extroversion to introversion. However, part of the reason so many people would classify me to be heavily extroverted is that tends me to be how I present myself, because, as we discussed at this Gear Up, educational and work environments do seem to unfortunately favor extroversion. Even at Turing, which is populated with many self-described introverts, encourages us to work and learn in a highly collaborative way that is not necessarily ideal to the introvert learning process. Even as an "extrovert," I definitely learn more effectively in an introverted manner, when I'm allowed to really dig in to a topic or problem on my on own. That learning is better cemented when I am come back to a partnered or group learning environment and discuss my findings/process after my individual struggle. This Gear Up discussion came at an ideal time, when I was first learning React. I truly feel like I understood React so much better after working with a partner - Maia- who also wanted to have a more introverted learning process at the front of the project. I think it's great that the response to this discussion led to more opportunties for working and learning quietly on our own, not *always* having to work and learn with others.
Overall, I think Turing chooses relevant, meaningful Gear Up topics, but these two topics were particularly resonant.

### Reflection
##### Details on project management strategies you used in your projects; What went well? What didn’t go well?
* The key to success with any project I've worked on is consistent, open communication. I feel like all of my partners and I have had no issues letting each other know about tasks/concepts we're struggling with, addressing scheduling conflicts, and checking in on how we feel the project is progressing.  Using waffle.io definitely brought a higher level of organization and management to my projects this module!

##### How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
* Three key pieces of feedback I've received from team members have been to work on my code sanitation, be more willing to take risks, and better verbalize my though processes when pairing. The first is something I have been able to implement immediately; I am starting to really appreciate the necessity of having clean, "pretty" code. As my confidence in writing code grows, I'll be willing to take more risks, and I think this is a definite shift that will take place in the next module. I feel like working with some very verbal partners has definitely helped me improve my ability to talk through my process. It's something I've really tried to focus on, and it's something else that's improving as I become more confident.
