# Kristen Burgess - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At this point in my coding career, I don't really have an area of emphasis. I went into
this module just wanting to absorb as much information about as many different concepts
as possible. I have now reached a comfort level where I am not afraid to dig in and try things and probe
deeper into things that were formerly so uncomfortable that I didn't even want to touch those concepts.
I'm so excited to move forward!

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Notes:
Kristen is not afraid to try things out and experiment, but needs to work on fully and deeply understanding exactly what the code she is writing is doing and why it’s doing what it is. She knows how to get things to work, but when pressed can’t always explain what is going on under the hood. She absorbs information, direction, and explanations very well, is an absolute pleasure to work with, and I expect that she will quickly improve on deeper understanding. Good job!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kristenburgess25/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

Color Changer was a great opportunity for me to exercise my ability to work alone! I really valued this
project because it confirmed that I am capable of working through these problems on my own.

## Personal Portfolio

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kristenburgess25/portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

My personal portfolio is a serious work in project that has not received nearly enough attention in the last two weeks.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Game Time

* [GitHub URL]((https://github.com/devinmarieb/game-time))
* [Original Assignment]((http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html))

Game Time was our last project of the module, and I felt like it was a truly perfect little capstone.
I felt like I was able to apply a wide variety of skills I gleaned throughout the module, as well as seek
out a number of new methods. I felt like the length of this project gave me the needed chance to dig into something deeply and get closer to truly understand how all of the moving pieces of a project interact with one another.

### Notes:

- developers feel comfortable with loops
- for loops and arrays seem solid
- would like to see uses of map.
- great use of charAt()

### Functional Expectations
3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
### Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

### Partner Feedback
Kristen was a great partner to have going into Game Time (which was both an exciting and stressful project)! We took the time to discuss how we were both on a similar level of knowledge and easily picked a game to make that involved concepts we both felt we wanted a better understanding of. We broke down the project into small first steps and ultimately ended up scrapping our original set up and going with another. Our setup switched on a day Kristen had to be absent and I was impressed with her ability to quickly understand the new set up and be able to work with it right away. Kristen and I worked well keeping each other in check and making sure we were never stressed out. Kristen does a great job of not getting overwhelmed when things don’t work and has a great ability of taking a step back from the problem and looking at it from alternative solutions. Overall, this was my favorite project and a lot of it had to do with our partnering!

## Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kristenburgess25/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box was the most challenging project of the module for me. I probably learned the most from it of any of the projects, but it was indisputably the most painful. Working more heavily with object oriented JS and with local storage was a lot to take on in one project, but I definitely finished this project well prepared to take on the challenges of the end of the module.

### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
### User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
### JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
### Partner Feedback
Working with Kristen was great. She really understood what we were doing when working on the Idea Box project. We worked a lot together through tough problems and got some pretty good work done. I would be happy to work with Kristen again especially now that I’m feeling more confident with the work we have been doing!

## Linked List

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/kristenburgess25/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked list was probably my favorite project of the module, largely because I had such an amazing collaboration experience on this project. I generally like to work alone or divide up tasks, but I know that is not the best way to work or learn in this program or even in this industry. Working with Hilary on our second project really made me more comfortable with and excited about working in partners and on team projects. We paired through almost every step, and I felt like we struggled together so much and learned that much more from the project for allowing ourself to openly struggle and talk our way through our throughts and logic and approaching that struggle. 

### Evaluation Notes:
- solid second attempt at javascript
- could use some refactoring. some small syntax stuff but overall solid
- look into javascript closures( you were really close to using one.)

### Functional Expectations
- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
### HTML Style
- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
### CSS Style
- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Partner Feedback
I really enjoyed working with Kristen on Linked List. We collaborated very well together. We were able to struggle through very complex concepts together, break them down, and eventually come to a solution. Our project ended up being a huge success. I look forward to working with Kristen again in the future. I know she will find huge success as a developer because her great collaboration skills and positive attitude.

## Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/Pilewski/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three
### Fundamental JavaScript Style
2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
Notes: Strong effort towards writing good javascript. Some opportunities to refactor and reuse code. Would be beneficial for devs to go back and refactor with a mentor.
### Partner Feedback
Working with Kristen on the first project of the module was a great way to get introduced to pair programming. Being able to talk through code with her allowed me to get an idea of exactly what the fuck is happening at any given time in this weird language burdened with a large amount of punctuation. She is super clever and I would be happy to be paired with her on any future project.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

### Feedback to Devin on Game Time
I had such a pleasant experience working with Devin on our final project, Game Time, for Mod 1! I felt from the beginning that we were on the same page- from our individual skill levels to our vision for the project- and that held for the duration of the project. I was absent for a work day where there was pairing time with Mod 2 students, and Devin did an impressive job of keeping me informed on changes that were made. Furthermore, she was able to effectively communicate to me the things she learned on the day I was gone and how we would be able to apply them moving forward in the project. Devin is a very direct communicator, and I think this was a major contributor to the success of our partnership. We paired through the toughest parts of the project, and I always felt like we were working cohesively, largely a result of solid communication. When we were not working as a pair, Devin consistently communicated her thoughts and approaches via Slack. I truly hope we get to work together again soon!

### Feedback to Mike on Idea Box
Mike was a really great partner to have on the challenging Idea Box project. We faced a lot of difficulties in this project, but we were still able to maintain a positive attitude as we took on numerous hurdles. Mike has exceptional problem solving skills that are are very valuable when writing code as a pair. I felt like we communicated well throughout the project, and we both learned a tremendous amount that served us well as we finished the module. I genuinely enjoyed having Mike as a partner, and I hope that we are a pair again in the future!

### Feedback to Hilary on Linked List
I had such a great experience working with Hilary on the Linked List project! I felt like we communicated and collaborated particularly well, and through that communication and collaboration, we had an exceptional learning experience. Hilary has a true talent for breaking down problems and effectively working and talking through them. She can explain her thought processes and logic as well (or better) than anyone I've worked with. Furthermore, she is pleasant to work with, bringing a great attitude and brilliant smile to class every day. She's been an outstanding partner, cohortmate, student rep at SAB, and friend, and I look forward to working together more in the future!

### Feedback to Alex on Number Guesser
I was incredibly lucky to work with Alex on our first project of the module, Number Guesser. He is an exceptional student of this trade that works hard to master the craft of writing code. Alex had such a stronger grasp on the workings of Javasript than I did at this early point in the program, and I cannot express enough how much I appreciated his patience with me throughout the project. Not only is he impressive as a student, he's also a great teacher. He painstakingly walked me through every line of code that was written, helping me establish my foundational understanding of JavaScript. In addition to being a partner who is intelligent and insightful, Alex is also highly entertaining. Whether struggling through a problem in the code or explaining an overarching concept, his demeanor and verbiage is always engaging and delightful.  


### Being a Community Member

I've worked with Kristen several times over the module and am impressed with her acumen and drive.
I've watched her attack problems in creative ways while pivoting to new strategies should an impasse loom.
She's cheerful and compassionate. A few times I've shared some difficult feelings and she was patient and attentive.
Kristen is, on her own merit, the arbiter of her future. And the grace with which she balances life's undulating challenges remains an art of itself.
--Andy Young


### Playing a Part

I don't feel like I did an optimal job of participating in the Turing community this module. I had some heavy responsibilities outside of school, but these will be much less moving forward, and I am looking forward to becoming more involved. I think that the community here is what makes this such an incredible place to learn and grow into a person that is going to thrive in life after Turing. The true benefits of this system can't be reached without my conscientious effort to be an active contributor in the culture and community at Turing.
