Get your .jshintrc right plz.

#### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Accessibility
* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

#### User Interface
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than * 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style
* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style
* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### JavaScript Style
* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### Workflow
* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### Partner Feedback from Lacey
* I really enjoyed working with Kristen on 2DoBox. She is a super hard worker, and I was really impressed with her drive to   delve into testing. Even though unit testing in Selenium wasn't very much fun, It was great to see her find something she was passionate about learning, and then continue on to be a kickass enzyme tester. I think we had a great group dynamic and I'd love to work with her again in the future!

* It was a pleasure working with you Kristen!  You are a hard worker and I love that we both learned so much and had a great workflow.  We were able to troubleshoot and figure things out and gain confidence.  Thanks for being the testing master!  My only constructive advice would be, while pairing, be better at communicating your problem solving approach.  However, I do also love that we split up to dig into the code as individuals.  Thanks for bringing your happy, upbeat personality to the project and the community!

#### Partner Feedback from Hilary 
* Kristen is always fun to work with on projects. She always has a positive attitude, good communication, and she is really good at testing. I appreciated that Kristen worked so hard on testing constantly throughout the project. Although we had a couple of bumps in the road at the end of the project getting everything merged, I found my experience working on this project with Kristen particularly successful. 

#### Partner Feedback from Kinan  
* Kristen has been a great person to work with. She always manages to generate a positive attitude during the times we have worked together, especially during stressful times. She is also realistic about managing work and is able to understand well-balanced timeframes for completing features on projects. Kristen worked out test suites for the large end-of-module project and was able to help implement major components for our application. She will be an asset to any team in the future.
* I think Kristen's biggest room for improvement is in risk-taking. I feel like she has a lot of talent and skills, but could just go out on a whim to use those skills more often than she thinks.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Lacey on 2DoBox 
* I had heard positive reviews from cohortmates on Lacey as a partner, and I was so excited to be paired together for 2DoBox! Her repuation did not falsley precede her! Lacey has a great attitude, and she approaches difficult problems with a calm, positive demeanor that is really pleasant to work with. She is well organized, a strong communcicator, and a hard worker. I think she writes very clean, logical code, and I felt like we paired together very well. Furthermore, in spite of all her modesty, she is so incredibly talented with creating beautifully designed layouts through exceptionally well written CSS! My only critique- and it's hardly a critique- is to be more confident! I feel like there are times you doubt yourself more than you should; you have no reason to with as talented as you are! I look forward to working together again in the modules ahead! 

#### Feedback to Graham on Weathrly 
* I was so pleased to be paired with Graham for our first forray into writing React components, working with API data, and testing with Enzyme. The learning process and implemenation of the new tools used in the Weathrly project were fundamental for the the rest of the module, and Graham was a great partner for laying that foundation. I often learn new concepts best when given the opportunity to dig into  them on my own, and then convene with my partner to discuss my findings/process/progress. Graham was encouraging to this process, and furthermore, he was able to effectively help me fill in several gaps in understanding. He is exceptionally bright, and while sometimes his code gets particularly complex, I never felt like we were disconnected in the process. Graham has an unparallelled work ethic that he delivers with a positive and pleasant outlook. He would be a remarkable asset to any team, and I hope we have the chance to work together again sometime!

#### Feedback to Maia on Shoot the Breeze 
* It was such a pleasure working with you, Maia! You are a tenacious learner with such a strong work ethic. Neither of us were feeling particuarly confident with React when we started, and that definitely changed in the course of this project! Your dedication to really understanding these new tools we are working with was contagious, and it definitely contributed to my learning process. I feel like part of how/why we both learned so much was allowing ourselves to really individually dig in deep to some features. You did a great job of explaining things as you figured them out, something I'm really trying to improve on, and I think you provided a great example.

#### Feedback to Kinan on Final Project - Nimble Network
* It was such a pleasure to finally get to work with Kinan on our final project for Mod 2, Nimble Network. Kinan brings a lot to the table as a team member. He is a very thoughtful individual, and this shines through in both the work he produces, as well as the way he interacts with the team. I felt like, from the beginning, Kinan had a strong vision for our project. Even with the usual stress and being ill during our project, I never once felt like his enthusiasm or work ethic waned. He is a great communicator, and I felt like whether we were pairing or working separately, we never really felt off base/out of touch with each other. I would definitely love to work together again!

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Verou Posse leads, Chelsea Skovgaard and Lacey Knaff 
* When starting the Verou Posse, we joked that Kristen would be our "community liaison". But it was no joke. From bringing cookies to a posse meeting to volunteering to lead presentations, Kristen has been a great posse member and community participant. She also asks great questions during posse presentations and always has a positive and cheerful attitude. We are so happy that she joined our posse!

### Professional Skills 

#### Gear Up Reflections Recap 

When I think back on Gear Ups from this module, two discussions are most memorable: responsibilities of citizenship && introversion vs extroversion. 
* I'm generally very enthusiastic about politics, and I have always made a point to promote political involvement and appreciation of our rights and responsibilities as American citizens. However, I'm very cognizant of the fact that there are many who don't appreciate these responsibilities or even give them much thought. The political climate of this country has been obscenely charged this year, but it was as important as ever to stay invested and involved in the process. We, in fact, saw an even lower level of voter turnout than in years past. Personally, I am very disappointed by this. However, through the discussion that took place at this Gear Up, I also have a higher level of empathy and understanding towards disenchanted voters who felt it was their right to not participate this year. American politics is a highly divisive subject, but I think it's so important to encourage intelligent and open conversation of the subject. I deeply appreciate Turing making a point to facilitate such a discussion. 
* Although most people that know me would classify me as VERY extroverted, I would actually give myself more of a 60/40 split on extroversion to introversion. However, part of the reason so many people would classify me to be heavily extroverted is that tends me to be how I present myself, because, as we discussed at this Gear Up, educational and work environments do seem to unfortunately favor extroversion. Even at Turing, which is populated with many self-described introverts, encourages us to work and learn in a highly collaborative way that is not necessarily ideal to the introvert learning process. Even as an "extrovert," I definitely learn more effectively in an introverted manner, when I'm allowed to really dig in to a topic or problem on my on own. That learning is better cemented when I am come back to a partnered or group learning environment and discuss my findings/process after my individual struggle. This Gear Up discussion came at an ideal time, when I was first learning React. I truly feel like I understood React so much better after working with a partner - Maia- who also wanted to have a more introverted learning process at the front of the project. I think it's great that the response to this discussion led to more opportunties for working and learning quietly on our own, not *always* having to work and learn with others. 

Overall, I think Turing chooses relevant, meaningful Gear Up topics, but these two topics were particuarly resonant.

### Reflection 
##### Details on project management strategies you used in your projects; What went well? What didn’t go well?
* The key to succuess with any project I've worked on is consistent, open communication. I feel like all of my partners and I have had no issues letting each other know about tasks/concepts we're struggling with, addressing scheduling conflicts, and checking in on how we feel the project is progressing.  Using waffle.io definitely brought a higher level of organization and management to my projects this module! 

##### How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
* Three key pieces of feedback I've received from team members have been to work on my code sanitation, be more willing to take risks, and better verbalize my though processes when pairing. The first is something I have been able to implement immediately; I am starting to really appreciate the necessity of having clean, "pretty" code. As my confidence in writing code grows, I'll be willing to take more risks, and I think this is a definite shift that will take place in the next module. I feel like working with some very verbal partners has definitely helped me improve my ability to talk through my process. It's something I've really tried to focus on, and it's something else that's improving as I become more confident.
