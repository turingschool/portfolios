# __Kinan Whyte - M2 - Front-End Portfolio__

### **_Areas of Emphasis_**

> During Module 2 I mainly sought out to refine fundamental skills and knowledge about Javascript and CSS. This time I was able to refine these skills in ReactJS while using Firebase.

> I also sought out to work hard while keeping a good life balance, keep stress levels low, and participate in outside community events, such as Meet-ups that would enable better networking and job opportunities.

> Work Ethic at Turing can be summed as follows: "ABC" - Always Be Coding.

> Turing highlights an educational approach in which an applicative discipline dominates. The number 1 Goal has been to get programming as much as possible. This is what occurred here in this module. I have been stunned to see the progress that has unfolded on the first 6 weeks of the front-end program.

---

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### **_Solo Projects_**

> Projects invited all students to test skills they didn't know they even had. Much of our learning was self-resourced through online components, community interaction, and experience in writing a lot of code. Often we were given lessons after our self-learning. This reinforced concepts and shed light on particular tools in a way that wouldn't be as beneficial otherwise.

# _NumberGuesser-React_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser-react)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/number-guesser-react/)

**Description:**<br>
Here, I re-built a small game where the user picks a number between 1 and 100, this time using ReactJS and ES6. Upon entering the number, the application displays feedback indicating how close their guess was to a random number that was generated. 

After the guess is submitted, the 'max' and 'min' were increased and decreased respectively to add a greater difficulty after each successful guess. Users were also able to customize the range at their own volition.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
### Evaluator: Taylor Moore
### Kinan Whyte

#### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### **_Team Projects_**

> Pairing with team members to work through implementing an idea from start to finish is essential for the growth of a software engineer. Approaches to writing and building software may bode well in the land of one, but our true skills and prose were tested under the fires of approaches and perspectives colliding during group projects. Communication skills, workflow, strengths, and work styles all mixed and mingled. Many gems were born under these temperatures.

# _2DoList-Pivot_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)

**Description:**<br>
In module 1, we focused on building an 'ideaBox' in which users could record and archive their ideas (good and bad alike). The idea behind 2DoList was to take the code base from one person's repository and pivot: Re-create this app with added features, this time with a spin that ideas are now to-do items on a list. 

Ian and I took an approach that caused us to refactor all of the code under the MVC model in which a controller handles all the function calls, and components on the DOM (or Model) are updated and created with their own logic separated. All of the UX/UI was handled in the View in which we housed our JQuery calls. We also used sass for the first time to organize our CSS styling.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>

# _Shoot the Breeze_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)
* [Live Version](https://shoot-the-breeze-b2fe6.firebaseapp.com/)

**Description:**<br>
In this project we set out to build a chat-box style app in which users could shoot the breeze with each other from a sign-in with google accounts on Firebase. Within each users account, upon sign-in, they are able to save up to 100 messages and view a list of users that are present in the chat room. Users are also able to filter through messages by message content, username, and date/time. They can sort messages by new or old, and can also sort messages by clicking a user that is present on the user-list. If you're feeling chatty, maybe it's a good time to shoot the breeze.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)
* [Live Version](https://nimblenetwork-d13c3.firebaseapp.com/)

**Description:**<br>
The goal of this app was to refine our craft in developing software--to not just stick to original assumptions, regardless of how much friction those decisions cause down the road. Another goal of this project is to push and test your ability to adapt your project as we learn new skills and topics over the course of the rest of the module. Planning, design, and overall user experience of the application are highlighted in this app.

We chose to create a contactlist for users to house information of potential employers, clients, or whatever category of connections desired. Networking is a critical skill, and it can get hard to keep track of everyone you meet when you’re getting established in a new industry. Build an app to help you organize all your contacts.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Consience

* [Gear-up Details - Vote Your Conscience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Rights and Responsibilities of a US citizen to their country and fellow citizens can be summed up as being an *ACTIVE* member or participating/engaging member of an organizational body, in this case the USA. Membership or citizenship is contingent on each member following the group's rules, actively participating, and contributing to the group's health and strength. In sum, rights of citizenship are balanced by responsibilities.

In the absence of such self-governance, without the collective willingness to live virtuously, participate intelligently in the public sphere, perpetuate the greatest good for the greatest number, and serve each other and our communities, more and more regulations and laws must be passed to compel behavior and maintain order, curtailing liberty. Freedom paradoxically cannot endure without constraints.

No matter how smart, dazzling-to-the-interviewers, or well-educated someone is, if employees haven’t accepted that person as a leader in the past, and given him or her their support and allegiance, it’s unlikely they’ll do so now.

In line, Freud argued that the psychological process of leadership occurs because a group of people — the followers — have replaced their own narcissistic tendencies with those of the leader, such that their love for the leader is a disguised form of self-love, or a substitute for their inability to love themselves. “Another person’s narcissism”, he said, “has a great attraction for those who have renounced part of their own… as if we envied them for maintaining a blissful state of mind.”

* [Gear-up Details - Inroversion and Extroversion on Teams](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

Strengths and Weaknesses of Introversion:

Strengths of introverts lies in revelations and insights that come from deep thinking, reflection, and contemplation that result from solitude and time outside of the influence from others, which can be biased, and persuasive for the group and collective in general based on natural human tendencies. These insights have the potential to contribute to innovations and socio-cultural influences that potentially contribute to the growth and progress/evolution of consciousness.

Weaknesses are that they are less able to share these ideas and insights because of social anxiety, shyness, or other preferred ways of being that don't involve extroverts as much, which can lessen the impact of great thinking in our world.

---
* [Gear-up Details - Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

Resilience is largely a concern of attitude towards approaching life. It can be summed up as strength and courage during times of difficulty, coming out better than you started, despite the challenges.

One take away I had was that it is important to be resilient when going through experiences such as Turing that are very challenging but have positie outcomes, especially if it is aligned to your passion.

On the other side, sometimes resilience could be a weakness if you perceieve resilience as tolerance of conditions that may not be aligned to your passion and positive outcomes but seem to strengthen character because you can say you endured through it, regardless of how damaging it was.

## Community

### E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### Giving Feedback

**To Matt Kaufmann**:

Time after time, Matt has been a huge helping hand for picking out the bugs in my program and for optimizing my software methodology. He has been the overall odds and ends go-to in our mod and has largely participated in helping countless students out with working through logic. Matt has some experience prior to Turing working with software and databases, and for this reason he has been immensely helpful. Our strengths are often times our greatest weaknesses as well, and if there was anything he could improve on it would be slowing down at points and just giving the attention to one group instead of being pulled to others, bouncing back and forth between the two and his phone sometimes. If he is able to focus on one group at a time, that would be ideal, but I also see the benefit of giving a bit here and then over there at the same time. I would also recommend not consistently pairing with 1 person or group over and over again. You're too valuable to the whole of the front-end to just spend time with a select few, even if that's what their preference is! Great work overall, Matt. I am deeply appreciative of the assistance I get from you.

**To Kristen Burgess**:

Kristen has been a great person to work with. She always manages to generate a positive attitude during the times we have worked together, especially during stressful times. She is also realistic about managing work and is able to understand well-balanced timeframes for completing features on projects. Kristen worked out test suites for the large end-of-module project and was able to help implement major components for our application. She will be an asset to any team in the future. I think Kristen's biggest room for improvement is in risk-taking. I feel like she has a lot of talent and skills, but could just go out on a whim to use those skills more often than she thinks.

**To Mike Ziccardi**:

Mike has been a great person to work with. He offers an ideal approach to project management which goes a long way in the the software development process. He is approachable, able to see what work we need to accomplish, and what timelines make sense to accomplish them. On times where we were stressed or under-estimated work time, Mike has remained calm, collected, and encouraging. He is able to hold concepts in his mind well, and is able to give honest feedback when needed about where he is. If he could improve on anything it would be to give himself more credit. He can be hard on himself, but for what has been put on the plate, he is doing great and is definitely suited for this work. I would also say that he should take more opportunities to solidify understanding by supplementing learning with typing and re-writing projects if necessary just to get the muscle memory. I am confident Mike will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with him.

**Ian Lancaster**:

Working with Ian has been a great pleasure. He offers many skills to the table, especially an ability to plan projects and organize software tools that make workflow very effective and smooth. He also approaches project management with clean eyes and an ability to foresee future problems with preparation and confidence. He is approachable and articulates well. His patience was vital to setting a stage for learning. I was impressed at how well he has been able to meet people where they are but also bridge understanding to boost team performance. On times where we were stressed or under-estimated work time, Ian has remained focused and positive about project outcomes. He is able to hold high concepts well and communicate steps to implement features with prose. If he could improve on anything it would be to give himself a break more often. He can work hard over long hours and has awesome stamina, but burnout may leak around corners if not managed with preventative measures. I am confident Ian will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with him.

**To Dale Hendrickson**: 

Working with Dale has been a great pleasure. His ability to plan ahead with projects and to approach the software process is strong and indicates a healthy background in project management. This has made workflow very effective and smooth. He has taken initiative for our cohort to host review sessions nearly every morning on the weekdays, which has certainly strengthened bonds among students and solidified concepts for our group. Indeed the name of these groups, IronFE, has stayed true to its meaning. Dale is approachable and patient with learning concepts and progressing through the software development process, both vital to setting and constructing a classroom for optimal learning. If he could improve on anything it would be to increase his speed and workflow skills. His pace to thinking is refreshing and ultimately his process is clean and efficient. While implementing features and writing code, however, I could see some room for learning more shortcut keys and gaining some time with the keyboard to increase muscle memory. I suggest typing.io for this. Overall, I am confident Dale will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with him.

**To Hilary Lewis**: 

Working with Hilary has been a great pleasure. Her ability push through projects and features in uncanny, as she is certainly determined to succeed accomplish as much as possible. Hilary's understanding of approaching the project from individual and group perspectives made for a nice balance between both work styles. During some stressful moments of getting features implemented, Hilary offered a supportive approach. If she could improve on anything it would be to slow down to go faster. At times I felt like she wanted to get things on the app before we wrote a line which made for some potentially unneeded pressure. I think there is some room for communicating more effectively with teammates while in the nitty-gritty of collaborating and being more open to the benefits of pairing as a team. Overall, Hilary offers a healthy pace to her process and works very well individually. This allowed for a sense of real ease into dividing and conquering which was definitely refreshing. In our team, she demonstrated strong initiative and skillful planning. Overall, I am confident Hilary will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with her.

#### Being a Community Member

**From Ian Lancaster**:

I really enjoyed working with Kinan on the 2DoBox-Pivot. I think we worked very effective together and I appreciated your desire to learn and to tackle new and difficult challenges. One area that we could have both improved on for this project was proper planning. We were both busy the first couple days the project, and may have underestimated the time investment that was going to be required on the weekend. We put in long hours and got the project done, but we could have made the process much easier on ourselves by better spreading out the work over time. I most appreciated your calm demeanor even as we got down to the wire, and your open and honest communication style.

**From Mike Ziccardi**:

Working with Kinan on Shoot the Breeze was a pleasure. We worked well and paired for most of this project. When we were down to the last day Kinan's grit was seen. We worked right up to the assessment time. Good work Kinan. Way to kill it! For imporovement: I think we worked well. communication was great but its something that we can always make better

**From Hilary Lewis**: 

Kinan is always fun to work with on projects because he is very careful and mindful of his work. He is able to think very logically about problems to find the best solution. He worked very hard on the image function and I really appreciated it. Although we had a couple of bumps in the road at the end of the project getting everything merged, I found my experience working on this project with Kinan particularly successful. Communicate with each other earlier on merging. I think it was difficult and different having three people in the group.

**From Dale Hendrickson**:

I worked with Kinan on the weathrly project. Since it was an ungraded project, we took more time up front discussing approaches to meet the spec. I appreciated how he was willing to take some risks and try new things as we worked through the project. I also appreciated the balance individual and pair work time. Kinan brings a calm and reflective vibe to the cohort. I look forward to working with him in Mod3. An area of strengthening may be communicating verbally where he is with a problem as he is working through it in pairing sessions.

**From Kristen Burgess**: 

It was such a pleasure to finally get to work with Kinan on our final project for Mod 2, Nimble Network. Kinan brings a lot to the table as a team member. He is a very thoughtful individual, and this shines through in both the work he produces, as well as the way he interacts with the team. I felt like, from the beginning, Kinan had a strong vision for our project. Even with the usual stress and being ill during our project, I never once felt like his enthusiasm or work ethic waned. He is a great communicator, and I felt like whether we were pairing or working separately, we never really felt off base/out of touch with each other. I would definitely love to work together again! I really can't think of any major suggestions for improvement! I wouldn't have traded you and Hilary as partners for anyone :)

### Playing a Part

**Ways I supported the larger Turing community by:**<br>

I am a student-advisory board member, along with Hilary Lewis, who attends weekly meetings with other students who represent their cohort. Over the course of module 2, we have discussed ways in which community members can support each other and take actionable steps to improve qualities in the academic arena, facilities, and social spheres inside and outside of Turing.

During the module, I have lended a hand to Module 1 students that may be in need of assistance. I have been open to lend a hand to others during any struggles, and share my knowledge freely in order to support any members of the cohort and greater community in ways that they need it. We have also represented our cohort at SAB meetings in which we can bridge the needs of many cohorts under one roof.

During this module I have co-led group retros for our cohort, in which we discuss things that went well during the module, and how to improve things that didn't go so well. and other activities and meetings outside of the classroom. 

I have also made an effort to create more opportunities for networking outside of the classroom and have attended meet-ups. I created 2 channels in Slack: one to facilitate a greater social scene for the front-end program that is being co-created right now by totally new student experiences called #front-end-social, and another that improves chances to meet employers and network with other developers outside of the school to make transitioning out of Turing smoother, called #off-campus.
