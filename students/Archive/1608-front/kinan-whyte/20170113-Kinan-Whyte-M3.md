# __Kinan Whyte - M3 - Front-End Portfolio__

### **_Areas of Emphasis_**

> During Module 3 I mainly sought out to refine fundamental skills and knowledge about Javascript and SASS. This time I was able to refine these skills in ReactJS, learn a new framework, EmberJS, and apply my front-end skills during a 3-week personal project with another back-end student, Vido Seaver, in which we build a digital globe (interactive map) with d3, JS, and Ruby on Rails.

> Work Ethic at Turing can be summed as follows: "ABC" - Always Be Coding.

> Turing highlights an educational approach in which an applicative discipline dominates. The number 1 Goal has been to get programming as much as possible. This is what occurred here in this module. I may have coded more than ever during my personal project, and have certainly spent the longest hours in a day working on projects.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### **_Solo Projects_**

> Projects invited all students to test skills they didn't know they even had. Much of our learning was self-resourced through online components, community interaction, and experience in writing a lot of code. Often we were given lessons after our self-learning. This reinforced concepts and shed light on particular tools in a way that wouldn't be as beneficial otherwise.

# _World-Data Correlator_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/correlator)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

**Description:**<br>

The goal of this project was to create a successful web application from a project idea. The idea was for this app to be able to solve an actual problem. 

Because I love traveling so much, sometimes when you are researching places to visit, whether for vacation or for living, it's hard to find solid information that is consolidated in one place, that makes researching easier. 

The idea behind this app was to build a hub of consolidated information for countries and cities worldwide. I wanted to provide some visuals for data representation and create a unique UI experience for users. Being able to spin up a world "globe" that allows you to click on countries was very challenging, since d3 requires such a high learning curve. 

Overall, it has been awesome to see how so much data can come together in one place, that may lend lasting hours to a true wanderlust doing diligent research.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### **_Team Projects_**

> Pairing with team members to work through implementing an idea from start to finish is essential for the growth of a software engineer. Approaches to writing and building software may bode well in the land of one, but our true skills and prose were tested under the fires of approaches and perspectives colliding during group projects. Communication skills, workflow, strengths, and work styles all mixed and mingled. Many gems were born under these temperatures.

# _Weather Tracker_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/weather-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/weather-tracker)

**Description:**<br>
In this project we built a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page. One of the main goals included retrieving and displaying forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API. We used the Geolocation API to fetch weather from a user's current city. 
          
When using this app, a user is able to save “pinned” or favorite cities in order to display multiple extended weather forecasts at ease. The OpenWeatherMap API does not use security precaution, and thus has enabled cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on their servers. Thus when testing this app, it is necessary to allow your browser to load "unsafe scripts" in order to render fresh weather information and current weather data.

# _remEMBER_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/remEMBER)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

**Description:**<br>
The idea behind this app was to create a notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality. On top of the fact that Ember was a entirely new framework to work with, developers were not to have commit rights to the master branch. 

Thus, all changes had to be made through pull requests that were reviewed by instructors and merged into master when approved. Aside from learning a new JS framework, this project was largely focused on dialing development github workflow, ensuring a smooth process of communicating what new features are made or worked on in all future projects. Some examples include, structuring a commit message properly, pulling down master a master version of the app as it is officially approved, and cherry-picking old commits to merge into the latest version of the app. I have never been so confident with and grateful for how github works. This has been a great lesson in learning how real projects are managed and seeing which methods of working through issues and features works most seamlessly.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
### Evaluator: Brenna Martenson & Nathaniel Foster
### Kinan Whyte & Graham Nessler

This project was graded as new PR's were submitted. Since all required PRs were submitted and approved, this project is considered a "PASS".

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### MicroAggressions

* [Microaggressions 101: Building Understanding Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

It seems microaggressions are really a form of passive aggression. They consist of content in a message that is in passing, as to indicate or imply a categorization of someone based on race. They have emerged as a sort of Racism 2.0, a new form of racist lingo that is much subtler. From the article, [Students See Many Slights as Racial ‘Microaggressions’](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/us/as-diversity-increases-slights-get-subtler-but-still-sting.html), it seems most of these comments are subtly damaging because they can be easily internalized because of their slight nature. They indicate something peculiar about a person's ethnicity that sets them apart or makes them unequal. 

Ultimately, although it may seem harmless, these comments can be harmful. People may be also unknowingly making these comments because of social construction and reconstruction of language that gets passed from multiple cultures colliding and intermixing, i.e. picking up lingo from a minority group in popular culture. What may be also worth noting is a potential oversensitivity that may result on the receiving end, in which it's important to simply recognize inherent good intention of people (if it so persists at the moment).

####Journey Mapping

* [Journey Mapping Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Feelings and thinking as part of a user's experience are often most important in driving actions and motivating people through a particular task or goal. When mapping a journey, it is important to break down an experience into phases in which each phase has a particular action step or process criteria that allowed them to move forward. It also seems that the best way to leverage applications or digital technologies is to take a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal approach, in which companies not only can improve UI and UX, but can also help "create new business models, drive operational excellence and enhance employee engagement," as talked about in this article: [Customer Journey Mapping Is at the Heart of Digital Transformation](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/customer-journey-mapping-is-at-the-heart-of-digital-transformation/).

I will certainly be sure to take in UI and UX 'journeys' rather than specific pieces of information that me be less relevant and powerful out of the context of the entire process.

####Grit

* [Grit Mindset](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit consists of a nice mix of persistence and passion. Without passion, persistence may not be enough in sustaining the determination you may have for something that doesn't hold a high value, which automatically motivates you intrinsically because you are inspired by it. Because grit is a function of behaviors and attitudes, it is dynamic. Behavior and behavioral change are largely dependent on attitudes/minsets, which are constantly changing. Thus, grit is certainly not a fixed quality.

In fact, having a growth mindset is largely partial to facilitating healthy grit and the kind of behavior that is conducive to success and excellence. The concept of grit applies directly to the Turing exeperinence, because success demands high logical thinking skills and perseverence through projects/curriculum that may not be initially present, but are required in order to succeed here at Turing. Using a "grit lens" when operating at Turing or generally throughout life is essential for overcoming challenging experiences, especially if they require stamina.

All in all, it may be problematic pushing through something, when keeping a balance is also vital to success, since burnout is inevitable if all biological resources are exhausted, even at the cost of maintaining gritty.

#### Giving Feedback

**To Kristen Burgess**:

Working with Kristen on our first project was great. We had already familiarized with each other from our Module 2 capstone project, so the general understanding of how each other operates was there. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Communicating is no problem for Kristen. At times, I feel she really enjoys communicating, which is awesome, as do I, but some fluff and buff or filler talk could be reduced simply because of stressful and pressing time conditions while in Turing. This skill will become a great asset in the real, balanced world of software development. Kristen was also adamant about keeping in touch over individual progress over SLACK, which made our collaboration as a team more seamless. She was also sick during part of it, and truly did well completing her side of things considering the inherent loss of energy. 

**Ian Lancaster**:

Working with Ian on our first project was great. We had already familiarized with each other from our Module 2 first project, so the general understanding of how each other operates was there, and we definitely work well together. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Implementing features on a project is not problem for Ian. This is definitely his strong suit. During this project, he set an intention to slow down and allow other team members to drive the project, since he often knows the next direction and can easily get ahead of other team members. I would have to say he was very successful at this, and was available to collaborate and work on problems with smoothness. The only improvement I may suggest for Ian is to ensure ownership over a role. Although he met a goal to allow others to lead, he may have picked a particular area explicitly to focus on so that other team members are aware of where he is. I'm' sure this really only applies to the context of this project. I'll be happy to work with Ian in the future. 

**To Graham Nessler**: 

Graham and I worked on our very first project together, so it was a long time coming to work again. We definitely felt new again, since we were building a reminder list with a new framework, Ember. We had a hard time learning the ins and outs of the framework, but overall, working together was easygoing. We were able to stay on the same page relatively, and divide and conquer well. I found our collaboration meaningful and successful. If Graham could work on anything, it would be to communicate better while getting stuck. We both may struggle with this, actually. I feel we could just at least work on conjuring up some words into what might be going on and where to go. I will be happy to work with Graham in the future.

**To Maia Stone**: 

Working with Maia on our first project was great. We had not worked together before, so it was nice to finally work together. This time we were building a weather app with in React, with the additional learning needed for implementing Redux. The project workflow as a whole was a bit more challenging this time because we each had never worked in a group of 4 together. This posed some challenges in communicating efficiently with each other and finding a general management skill set that would help us complete the project with all goals in mind. Overall, Maia did a great job with taking ownership over all of the testing in React. She had not focused on that much before, so the goal that she set out for this project surely was met. If she could improve on anything it might be rounding out to other corners of the project despite wanting to learn testing. She might have explained more about how she went about the testing process and shared more of her learning, but we were all hard-pressed with time to be able to share so much as well. Working with 4 people also made this less possible. I would be happy to work with Maia in the future.

#### Being a Community Member

**From Ian Lancaster**:

It was great to work with Kinan again on another project. Kinan was a key contributor in our group pairing sessions and was good at keeping the group on track and making sure we take breaks. I especially appreciate Kinan’s attention to detail and ‘see things through’ attitude. This was apparent when he spent a chunk of his weekend polishing the styles of the app and creating a better readme even after the project evel. One thing I think Kinan could work on is making his voice more heard. Kinan is relaxed, respectful, and a great listener but this often leads to others interrupting him and drowning out his voice.

**From Graham Nessler**:

**From Maia Stone**:

I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with Kinan. He really pushes hard to develop and deploy a top notch product. He's always up for taking on a tough logical or technical challenge, and also has great design sense and skills. In hindsight, it would have been great for us to all pair all around more, to better exchange ideas and techniques. However, we did a great job managing the project, considering the timeline, and that it was our first group of 4. I really appreciate your continued hard work on the design and completion of this project. Love the design! Thanks for being a great partner and classmate!

### Playing a Part

**Ways I supported the larger Turing community by:**<br>

During this module, much more responsibility and freedom were present. Turing instructors dub module 3 as the module in which much less hand-holding is present, a time in which there is a freedom and responsibility to learn and grow, answer questions, solve problems, and code more independently. This is to ensure a smoother transition post-Turing. 

During this module, I have offered my hand to students in lower modules, and have made myself available to them as needed for pairing. I have not missed any class time, fridays, etc. during this module and have been present and participating during class. I have set out to engage with the community in social fridays at Pourtions, having met many people across cohorts and back/front end programs. I believe this is enriching for the Turing community as a whole, since many of us receive great assurance of conditions, confidence in skills, and relief from stress.
