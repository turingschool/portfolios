# __Kinan Whyte - M1 - Front-End Portfolio__

### **_Areas of Emphasis_**

> Upon beginning Module 1 of the Front-End program of Turing: School of Software and Design, I was eager to continue refining and strengthening my skills as a student learning software development.

> One of my foremost goals for this module was to fill any gaps I had in working with an entirely new object-oriented language, Javascript. Having some experience working with Ruby in the backend of the program already, I was ready to understand how to write software from a different lens.

> Since I had placed more emphasis on community and events from the last module, I wanted to take the time to truly understand the content on my own and take on roles that demanded more leadership and confidence with my craft. This module was the first in which I have represented my cohort as a member of the student advisory board (SAB). Although this has demanded more of my attention to issues surrounding community here at Turing and the coherency of my own cohort, it has been a great focal point of organizing myself around all the various aspects of growth as a professional in this field, not just as an engineer. Feeling natural at facilitating and mediating others, I have felt great satisfaction taking on this role.

> Work Ethic at Turing can be summed as follows: "ABC" - Always Be Coding.

> Turing highlights an educational approach in which an applicative discipline dominates. The number 1 Goal has been to get programming as much as possible. This is what occurred here in this module. I have been stunned to see the progress that has unfolded on the first 6 weeks of the front-end program.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### **_Projects_**

> Projects invited all students to test skills they didn't know they even had. Much of our learning was self-resourced through online components, community interaction, and experience in writing a lot of code. Often we were given lessons after our self-learning. This reinforced concepts and shed light on particular tools in a way that wouldn't be as beneficial otherwise.

# _Number Guesser_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/number-guesser.md)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/number-guesser/)

**Description:**<br>
Here, we built a small game where the user picks a number between 1 and 100. Upon entering the number, the application displays feedback indicating how close their guess was to a random number that was generated. Upon guessing the number, the 'max' and 'min' were increased and decreased respectively to add a greater difficulty after each successful guess. Users were also able to customize the range at their own volition.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
### Evaluator: Jhun de Andres
### Kinan Whyte & Graham Nessler

# Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

# Fundamental JavaScript Style
2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

NOTES: lots of globals could refactor with a mentor on how to utilize closures and reuse functions. Strong effort. You've established some good rhythms.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/ideabox.md)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/idea-box/)

**Description:**<br>
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses was on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we relied on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
### Evaluator: Bree Thomas
### Kinan Whyte & Gabi Procell & Laura Sellers

## Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

# Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kswhyte/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/game-time.md)
* [Live Version](https://kswhyte.github.io/game-time/)

**Description:**<br>
Build a game that is playable in the browser. This was the sole purpose here, aside from focusing on OOP in JS. There was no server-side component. This project was inspired by [Minicade](http://minica.de/).

We needed to make our game full-featured and playable—not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features. To this end, we made sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This included:

- Indicating when the game is over and won or lost
- Allowing the user to start a new game
- Including a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
- Creating multiple rounds of difficulty (we increased game speed and amount of blocks to destroy).

We built Papaya Whipper, a new take on the classic Breakout arcade game. Its name carries on the legacy of building games as tributes to the finest Hex code colors, which began with Casey Metz and Jeff Duke's timeless classic, "Blanched Almonoid". To pay back our debt to these visionaries, there are hints of Blanched Almond throughout the games' styling.

Papaya Whipper is built entirely with Javascript and HTML5 Canvas, was tested using Chai, and is our humble tribute to one of the most powerful colors humankind has ever created - Papaya Whip.

#### Being a Community Member

**From Alex Pilewski**:<br>
Kinan was a fantastic member of the cohort and the larger Turing community. Always brings a calm demeanor to the proceedings and did a great job kicking off our group retros. It is obvious Kinan is a very intentional listener and I am certain I would enjoy being paired with him on any project. A+

**From Chaz-Mykl Gormley:**<br>
Kinan provided more than just insight and assistance with the projects and work assigned during Module 1, he was also a good friend during times of doubt, and overall a great person to be around - whether on campus or in social settings. Having experienced the Back-End Program, Kinan provided insight into how to succeed while here at Turing and maintain a positive school/life balance. Our time working together was during the 'Linked List' assignment, during which I was still attempting to grasp the JS language. Knowing this, Kinan was extremely patient and willing to take “baby steps” in reference to aiding me in understanding the “How” and “What” of the task at hand. Above all else, Kinan made the transition into this new period of life easier than expected, as he provided not only assistance in a school setting, but also the camaraderie that one may seek when in an unfamiliar environment.

**From Gabi Procell**:<br>
Things that I appreciated during our project: You ask LOTS of questions--and good questions! You also took the time to really soak up the project spec and what we needed to do. You know how to take your time on a project, and not race to the finish.

I'd recommend speaking aloud when working through a problem with others--only because it was sometimes difficult to see where you were going with an idea. Overall, I had a great experience working with you, Kinan! Keep up the great work!

**From Graham Nessler**:<br>
Kinan was my partner for Number Guesser, the first team project of the module. As my previous career was largely a “lone wolf” endeavor, I had some growing pains in adjusting to the group dynamic, but Kinan was a patient and thoughtful collaborator who always had an ear to listen. He also taught me a lot about using Git and Github, as this was my first group experience with this type of version control. I feel that our end project was strong and that we worked well together. Nice work, Kinan!

**From Nick Chambers**:<br>
Kinan and I worked together on Game Time and our collaboration yielded "Papaya Whipper", a thrilling new take on the classic arcade game, Breakout. From the outset, Kinan was a clear and honest communicator, which I valued greatly throughout such a large and daunting project. More than any other partner I have worked with to date, Kinan was dedicated to crafting artful code and mantaining good style. It was very inspiring to work with someone who approached their craft with such keen attention to good practice and logical elegance. His technical chops have certainly benefitted from this dedication, and I know I learned a lot from pairing with him. Throughout much of our time working together, Kinan helped make working hard feel easy. I had a tremendously positive experience working with him, and I know his future partners will as well.

#### Playing a Part

**Ways I supported the larger Turing community by:**<br>

I am a student-advisory board member, along with Hilary Lewis, who attends weekly meetings with other students who represent their cohort. Over the course of this module we have discussed ways in which the school culture and community is strong, needing improvement, and where it is lacking. We discuss in which ways we can take actionable steps to improve the state of Turing and then lead our cohort through a retro in which we discuss among ourselves.

During the module, I have been open to lend a hand to others during any struggles, and share my knowledge freely in order to support any members of the cohort and greater community in ways that they need it.

Taking part in discussion has been important to me, so I have participated in all Gear-ups, group retros, and other activities and meetings outside of the classroom. I unfortunately missed one gear-up on the discussion of bridging the gender gap, but actively participated in a discussion over lunch with other classmates in order to assure I am playing a part wherever I can.
