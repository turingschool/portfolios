# Hilary Lewis - M4 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis
During module 4, my goal was to master concepts with JavaScript and become strong with building an api using Express with Postgres. I also wanted to network a lot and find a company that I could work closely when leaving Turing. I was able to achieve all of these goals and I feel very prepared coming out of Turing and going into this career.

## A: End of Module Assessment
### Evaluator: Meeka and Alex

#### Specification Adherence
* 3: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above. Application is in production.

Can click on any's name to navigate to their specific information at any point. Forgiving them updates the count of forgiven vs. unforgiven. If forgiven, the button updates to say 'unforgive'. One minor UI bug remaining:

* Unformatted time stamp of grunge date.

### Javascript Syntax & Style
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests and a few unit tests where appropriate.

Client-side testing complete with unit tests on functionality to sort grudges by name and date and to test data of grudge list. All endpoints tested.

### CSS Style
* 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### User Interface
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### Workflow
* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Real Time
* https://github.com/hilarylewis92/polling-app
* https://real-time-polling-app.herokuapp.com/form/

##### Evaluator: Alex

#### Summary
In this project, I used client-side security to build a real time application with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients. I used AuthO to authenticate users when a user wants to take a poll that is already create.

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Jet Feul
* https://github.com/kswhyte/jet-fuel
* https://jetfuelshortener.herokuapp.com/

##### Evaluator: Brittany
##### Student: Hilary, Ian, & Kinan

#### Summary
This application allows users to create folders (like bookmark folders) to store long, ugly URLs as shortened URLs through our service.

The main goal of this application was to redirect a request at the shortened URL to a user's long URL equivalent. Each shortened URL is belong to a unique folder which is capable of storing "n" URLs.

The secondary goal was to track URL usage and provide popularity statistics.

### Volit (capstone)
* Production URL: https://www.volit.herokuapp.com
* Github Repo: https://github.com/hilarylewis92/volit

##### Evaluator(s):
##### Group Members: Hilary, Lacey, Ryan, Nick

#### Summary
The goal of Volit is to create a simple way for organizations and volunteers to coordinate scheduling. Volunteer coordinators will be able to setup different roles that need filled at events and volunteers will be able to easily manage which roles they can fill. The system will also provide a convenient reminder system with the ability to confirm or decline a volunteer opportunity and allow for easily swapping volunteer assignments in the event a role is not able to be filled.

### Feedback from Lacey
This was my first time working with Hilary on a project and I was really blown away by her project management skills. She has a unique ability to break down larger tasks into, smaller, more manageable pieces an divvy out those tasks accordingly so that things stay on track. She conistently checks in with her teammates to get a pulse on how things are going with the group and makes suggestions and changes to the workflow accordingly. If I could suggest one thing for her to work on, and this is something I also need to work on, is being more consistent with her use of es6 (using const or let vs. var, destructuring, etc). Otherwise, she's an extremely hard working and quick learning developer who I think is going to go on to be a great asset to any team.

#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up
[Overcoming Job Searching Imposter's Syndrome](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

* What are you looking for in your first dev job? Using your Flower Exercise, list the top 3 things that stand out to you as priorities in your next job.

- An culture that focuses on healthy work-life balance, collaboration, positivity, hard work, and having fun.
- Doing front-end development on a team that give a lot of support and mentorship as well as gives me challenging responsibilities
- Work on many different projects so I can see them from beginning to end and work in different frameworks. Diversity and keeps me learning.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
## Feedback for Lacey
I am so happy I got the opportunity to work with Lacey on this project. I regret not getting to work with her more throughout my time at Turing because our collaboration with each other allows me to learn a lot from Lacey. Lacey has so much to offer a team because of her eye for design, deep understanding of UX/UI, efficiency in writing JavaScript, clean and consistant css implementations, and encouraging personality. If there is one thing I can offer to Lacey, it would be to have confidence in the ideas she has to bring to a project, expecially when working with people who may have a 'bigger title'. I say this because her ideas for not only design but also javascript are very valuable and powerful. Overall, I hope in the future I can to work with Lacey again and Cultivator has won a very impressive designer and developer.

### Being a Community Member
Each Friday at Turing I took part in Gear Up which was a time for us to study and discuss certain topics related to web development and society. I found it very beneficial to collaborate and discuss these topics with others in the community because it helped me become more aware of these important things and implement it in my everyday life.

### Gear Up
#### Week 1
[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

* Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
- It limits the majority of the population from getting this job. Causes people to not apply for the job (self selecting out). It also lessens the opportunities companies can have with others ideas and perspectives.
- This is a much smaller population than exists. You deny a lot of people and team opportunities to have a diversity of ideas and skill sets.


* Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
- Valuing diversity is looking at skills and talents regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, etc rather than looking for someone that meets diversity requirements.  
- Meeting the quota can be a competition to make the company look good instead of continuing to look at the skills and then the experience the person has to bring to the team.

* Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
- Slowly implementing
- Educating people well about this issue
- Educate people in a more diverse way
- Hard to be around people that are not like minded


#### Week 3
[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
* How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire?
- Automation will have a huge effect on our economy from now until I retire. I believe automation could take over a lot of intellectual jobs and I am not sure what the new jobs will be for those who are being automated out of their jobs.

* Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes?
- I think the career I am in will not be as effected as much as others because I am doing the creative side of programming which seems difficult to automate.

* What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue?
- Talk about how to redistribute wealth
- Part of the solution is to restructure our rules through civic process
- Universal basic income

* What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?
- Turing in the innovation for education allowing people to go from a job that can easily be automated to working in a job that is automating.
