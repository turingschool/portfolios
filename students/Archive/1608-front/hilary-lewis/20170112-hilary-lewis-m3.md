# Hilary Lewis - M3 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis
During module 3, my goal was to make sure I got a better understanding of vanilla Javascript. I tried to attend IronFE as much as I could in the morning and these sessions were very beneficial. With attending these sessions, I realized I have a lot more work to do with these concepts.

## Projects
There were four projects during this module that I worked on within groups, pairs, and individually. I benefitted a lot from collaborating with my peers and learning how to listen and work together to become successful. I really enjoyed all of the people I worked with. I enjoyed working on my own the most becuase it was very beneficial to solve problems on my own and ensure that I was learning.

### remEmber
* https://github.com/rcwestlake/ember-remember

##### Evaluator:
##### Student: Hilary & Ryan

#### Summary
This was a week-long project built with Ember, and my first exposure to the Ember framework. It was built using agile principles, where each feature was reviewed, changed, and pushed into production before new features were started. It was a to-do app, and the focus was on Ember, not design and CSS, so it's not as pretty as I'd usually like.

## Feedback from Ryan
What can I say? Hilary is awesome. This was the first opportunity to work with her. Overall, it was a success, and I really enjoyed tackling Ember and a new project structure with PRs and more code reviews with her. Hilary is extremely sharp and a "go-getter". She thinks through problems logically and picks up on concepts quickly. My constructive feedback, equally applies to me - learn how to better listen to what your partners are saying before rushing ahead. Like me, Hilary can tend to jump around when trying to solve an issue without talking it through first. By slowing down, I expect it will actually lead to better outcomes. Overall, she was fun to work with, and I would gladly work with her again.

### WeatherDux
* https://github.com/hilarylewis92/weather-forecast
* https://hilarylewis92.github.io/weather-forecast/#/?_k=myzv4x

##### Group Members: Chelsea, Dale, Hilary, Matt
##### Evaluator(s): Taylor

#### Summary
This weather application was built using React, React-Router, and Redux and tested with Jest and Enzyme. The application retrieves and displays forecast data from Weather Underground API, uses the Geolocation to determine the weather in your current location, and saves favorite cities to display their forecasts. For each city, the user can display current forecast, ten day forecast, hourly forecast for each day, and delete any pinned cities.

### Specification Adherence:
4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture:
3 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing:
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style
4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Testing:
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow:
4 - The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Troubleshooting:
4 - The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Feedback from Matt
Hilary is a really great team member. She's assertive, involved and dedicated to the success of the project. Working with her on WeatherDux was really fun, since we did the whole project as a group. Her involvement made me grow as a developer, because she's such a great communicator. Because of that, she helped me to improve my explaining skills. Hilary works hard, is very reliable and pulls her weight as a team member. I look forward to working with Hilary again in the future.

### Feedback from Dale
I was on the first group project of Mod3 with Hillary. The project was an enhanced weather application. This was the first time I have worked with her. I struggled to find an area that I think could be strengthened. She pressed hard in discussions until she is able to understand the problem and the solution.  This helped me as well because things were examined from different angles and this required more reflection.  Her technical understanding was strong and was valuable to the team. I really like working with Hillary.

#### Feedback from Chelsea:
For our Weather Forecast application, we did the majority of the application together as a four person team. From this perspective, Hilary did a great job working with the team to help ensure that everyone had a chance to give input and to drive the project. I enjoyed having the opportunity to work with Hilary again. She is a quick learner, has a true passion for coding, and is willing to take risks and stretch herself. If there was an area for improvement, it would be to slow down or step away from a project when she is frustrated and then try working on the problem again.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
## Feedback for Matt

It was great working with Matt on my first Redux project because he had a really good working knowledge on how Redux worked. He had the idea to work on the entire project together and it ended up being the best group project experience I have had yet because I learned the most from working on each problem together. We collaborated and shared ideas very well but I would suggest that Matt takes into considerations others ideas and potentially allowing implementation of those ideas more often. Matt did very well at leading the group and making sure each of us knew every single line of code he developed on his own. Matt has a lot to offer a company considering he is a good teacher, leader, teammate, and hard worker.

## Feedback for Chelsea

I always enjoy working with Chelsea because she works very efficiently through problems. Chelsea came into the project having a limited understanding of Redux and she was able to logically share her ideas on setting up components and reducers. I enjoyed Chelsea's willingness to help me on tests when I was getting frustrated by suggesting that we Screenhero and she worked through the problems with me. Chelsea has a lot to bring to a team because of her teamwork, eye for design, understanding of user experience, and positive attitude.

## Feedback for Dale

Through this project, I appreciate that Dale encouraged the team to take a good amount of time at the beginning of the project to organize, set up waffle, and communicate how we were going to execute our project. Although Dale's workflow was slower than usual, I admire Dale's determination to learn Vim during this project. Dale had a lot of good ideas on how to set up components and reducers. Overall, Dale has a lot to offer a team in terms of effective troubleshooting, teamwork, organization, and effective communication.

## Feedback for Ryan

Learning Ember can be very frustrating but working with Ryan helped accelerate my learning curve. I enjoyed working with Ryan because he was able to pick up on concepts and solve problems very logically and quickly. Considering the unique circumstance that my computer was in the shop, I did not have the opportunity to touch the project as much as I would have liked at the beginning. I would have felt more comfortable if Ryan and I had switched off times using his computer more consistently so I did not feel like I wasn't contributing enough to the project. By the end of the project, Ryan solved this issue when he suggested that one person drives and the other person explains what the person driving should do. I would love to get the opportunity to work with Ryan again because I know we will be able to more efficiently communicate with each other by using this model.

### Being a Community Member

Each Friday at Turing I took part in Gear Up which was a time for us to study and discuss certain topics related to web development and society. I found it very beneficial to collaborate and discuss these topics with others in the community because it helped me become more aware of these important things and implement it in my everyday life.

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions 101: Week 1
[Building Understanding](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

* What are some takeaways from the articles?
It is interesting how our culture is so unaware of their comments and how they effect others around them. The more I read about this, the more frustrated I get because I receive and experience this stuff daily. I see it so much in day to day life that it just becomes normal and I can't always pin point when it is happening.

* How does this information change or reinforce what you thought about the topic of micro-aggressions at the outset of this session?
I am realizing that micro-aggression is sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional. There are a lot of micro-aggressive language within our culture that is consistent and hard to break free from or speak up against.

#### Journey Mapping Week 3
[Journey Mapping] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)
* We talked about our experience with trying to understand how to apply for ObamaCare. It is very difficult to know if you qualify unless you go through an endless amount of hard to understand questions. Once you complete the process, and learn that you do not quality,  you have to go through another unending process to find insurance that is suitable for each individuals situation. It would be nice if the government could dumb down the process and put some money into making a website/form that is easy to understand and automatically filters you into a pool for options that would fit your needs.

#### Grit Week 5
[Grit] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
* When I was tempted to give up, it was possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit because I was able to see that there was potential for growth even though I felt like I was failing at the time.

* It it helpful to know that you can get through something but I sometimes work too hard on it on my own without asking for other to help me out to find a solution.

* The most I develop on my own, the more fascinated I am with programing. I am very excited to see where it goes.

* Multiple projects that I can contribute to and see form beginning to end. Developing impressing and unique UI/UX design. Working on a team that had a balance between collaboration and individual work. Solving difficult challenges.

* Focus on my UX/UI design. Work through more Codewars. Find more balance when working in groups.
