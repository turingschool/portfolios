# Hilary Lewis - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
During this module, I wanted to get a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have worked hard with Javascript to work towards mastering the syntax and understand the logic. I have been able to master HTML and feel very comfortable with CSS. I have also worked hard on having a good workflow. Git and Github were surprising to me because it was a lot more difficult than I expected. I will be focusing a lot more on that next module.

## A: End of Module Assessment
### Evaluator: Louisa
### Notes:
Has a solid understanding of what each line of her code is doing, takes direction and collaborates very well, is a pleasure to pair with. Dealt with frustrations around her computer not working properly without getting frazzled or frustrated, and once things got up and running she was able to hop right into the challenge without any problems. Well done!

### Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow
* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

### Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

-----------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects
There were a lot of project during this module that I worked on within groups and pairs. I benefitted a lot from collaborating with my peers and learning how to listen and work together to become successful. I really enjoyed all of the people I worked with.

#### Game Time
* https://hilarylewis92.github.io/gametime/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

##### Evaluator: Louisa
##### Student: Hillary & Andrew

We developed the game breakout with a theme of halloween considering the season. In the game we are able to indicate when the game is over and won or lost, allow the user to start a new game, include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself, and create multiple rounds of difficulty.

##### Functional Expectations
3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

####Feedback from Andrew:
It was exciting to be able to work on Game Time with Hilary. She has an incredible ability to break down a problem piece by piece in order to find a solution. Essentially, her eye for detail is what I noticed to be a major strength of hers during this project. She is able to review code and find ways in which it can be simplified or refactored, a huge benefit to a project that included so many lines of code. In addition to her technical abilities, Hilary is easy to work with because of her initiation, collaborative ability, and availability. I would gladly work on any other project with her.


#### Idea Box
* https://ccgamble.github.io/ideabox/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

###### Group Members: Christine / Hilary
###### Evaluator(s): Jhun

In this project, I used JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions, and JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions when submitting ideas on a page.

##### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. Really good job, well done.

##### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
missed meta viewport tag in head so doesn't work on mobile.

##### JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

####Feedback from Christine:
Hilary and I worked together on Ideabox. Hilary is great with CSS, which was so helpful for this project! She is also able to think logically through problems and break them down into smaller pieces. This is an incredibly useful mindset to have. The way she approaches code and her drive to deliver solid work will make her a great programmer.

#### Linked List
* https://hilarylewis92.github.io/linked-list/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

###### Group Members: Kristen / Hilary
###### Evaluator(s): Jhun

This application includes two input fields for bookmarking a title and URL, a section for displaying the bookmarks, a submission button for creating the bookmarks, a delete button for removing the bookmarks, and a mark as read button.

###### Evaluation Notes(optional):
- solid second attempt at javascript
- could use some refactoring. some small syntax stuff but overall solid
- look into javascript closures( you were really close to using one.)

##### Functional Expectations
- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

##### HTML Style
- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style
- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### Workflow
- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

####Feedback from Kristen:
I had such a great experience working with Hilary on the Linked List project! I felt like we communicated and collaborated particularly well, and through that communication and collaboration, we had an exceptional learning experience. Hilary has a true talent for breaking down problems and effectively working and talking through them. She can explain her thought processes and logic as well (or better) than anyone I've worked with. Furthermore, she is pleasant to work with, bringing a great attitude and brilliant smile to class every day. She's been an outstanding partner, cohort-mate, student rep at SAB, and friend, and I look forward to working together more in the future!


#### Number Guesser
* https://hilarylewis92.github.io/number-guesser/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

###### Group Members: Ian / Hilary
###### Evaluator(s): Bree

This project includes an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, clearing the input field, reseting the game to its initial state, an element that displays the users most recent guess, and an element that displays a message to user.

##### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####Feedback from Ian:
Hilary was great to work with on the number guesser project. We worked well together while pairing to create the HTML and CSS for the project. The JavaScript portion was a bit more challenging, but we fed off each other’s work to get to a final product. There was a bit of duplication of work with JavaScript, but that was ok because we both got to get reps in writing code, and ultimately merged our work into something greater than the individual parts. In hindsight, I wish we would have spent more time tackling the JavaScript together.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#####Feedback to Christine:
Christine was wonderful to work with on Idea Box. She is very strong with Javascript and was able to teach me a lot about syntax and refactoring. Christine has a very good workflow and taught how to manage github. I appreciated working with Christine because she is always positive, patient, and kind. Because of those wonderful qualities, I know Christine will continue to find success as a developer.

#####Feedback to Kristen:
I really enjoyed working with Kristen on Linked List. We collaborated very well together. We were able to struggle through very complex concepts together, break them down, and eventually come to a solution. Our project ended up being a huge success. I look forward to working with Kristen again in the future. I know she will find huge success as a developer because her great collaboration skills and positive attitude.

#####Feedback to Ian:
I really enjoyed working with Ian on number guesser because he is a really good teacher. Considering it was the first project, I looked to Ian for a lot of help because he had more experience. Ian did a really good job in letting me drive as he asked questions to help lead me to the correct solution. I look forward to working with Ian again.

#####Feedback to Andrew:
Andrew was great to work with during our game time project. His workflow was very efficient and he taught me a lot about github. He was able to problem solve through complex and he debugged many parts of our game. Andrew is very thoughtful when it comes to programing and makes sure to do the best job he can. He was easy to collaborate and communicate with.

#####Feedback to Chelsea:
Even though I was not paired to work with Chelsea on a project yet, we collaborated a lot throughout the module. Chelsea is able to break down complex concepts so I can understand it in a logical way. Her eye for design and talent with CSS is something I will be looking to Chelsea for help in future modules. I look forward to being paired with Chelsea in future projects because I know we will work very well together and her sense of humor brings happiness to me every day.


### Being a Community Member

#####Feedback from Chelsea:
Although I did not work on a project with Hilary directly, she is always open to discussions about how to work through complex problems. She can explain the code she wrote in a way that helps you understand the ideas behind it and not just the syntax. She also is a positive and helpful presence in our cohort. I also appreciate her representation on SAB - she is great at getting and sharing feedback. Looking forward to working with her on a project. We have a great idea for a pomodoro app

#####Feedback from Devin:
While I didn’t work on any projects with Hillary, I did get to partner with her on a small in class assignment. It was fun to work with her and see her workflow. I appreciate that she’s not afraid to ask questions in class and always jumped on things that myself (and I’m sure a lot of other people) had questions about too.

#####Feedback from Gabi:
Thank you for being our SAB rep this mod and voicing our concerns to the other cohorts and staff. I hope that you'll continue with a leadership role during your time at Turing!


### Playing a Part
Through my strength finder test and reflection with Allison, I have realized I want to take a greater role in the push towards encouraging women to be in the tech industry. After a long discussion at lunch with a few people from my cohort about this issue, I realized that I need to be role model and encouraging young girls that programming and math is cool. Considering my background, I think this is something that would be very beneficial.

This module I took on the obligation of being an SAB member. I was able to represent the cohort efficiently by sending out weekly feedback surveys and relaying the feedback to Turing staff. I will also continue being apart of SAB next module.
