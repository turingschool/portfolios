# Hilary Lewis - M2 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis
During this module, I wanted to get a strong understanding of React. I have worked hard to master the structure and most effective way to set up components. I have been able to master setting up components and passing props to other components. I have also been able to have a deeper understanding of ES6 and developing DRY functions. I was surprised how quickly I pick up React and how much I like it. I really enjoy finding connections between components and passing props between them. I was also surprised that spending more time to define and break out components before starting to code can lead to better and more effective code.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
### Number Guesser
* https://github.com/hilarylewis92/number-guesser-react

##### Group Members: Hilary
##### Evaluator(s): Meeka

#### Summary
In this application, the user can input a minimum and maximum number where a random number is then automatically generated. The user can guess numbers in between the minimum and maximum and the application will give feedback on whether you guess is too high or too low from the random number generated. Once you win, the application will reset to its original state.

#### Comments
Bug: When we set a range of 6 and 7 or 9 and 10 then the guess number is off.

Slight tweak needed to formula - tested out with State - everything else is working correctly.
Fixed at time of eval!

#### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring

-----------------------
## C: Group Work & Projects
### Shoot The Breeze
* https://shoot-the-breeze-1be68.firebaseapp.com/
* https://github.com/hilarylewis92/shoot-the-breeze-1

##### Evaluator: Jhun
##### Student: Hilary & Christine

#### Summary
This project is a real time messaging app between users. Each component is tested using Enzyme, unit tests, and stored in Firebase. We also used Webpack build tools to build the application.

#### Comments: great components
* loved the bread crumbs left
* look into making your components more dumb
* great tests. Look into stubbing.

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Component Architecture
4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

#### User Interface
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### CSS/Sass Style
4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application (aside from logging in).

#### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Design
4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

#### Feedback from Christine:
Hilary and I worked on Shoot the Breeze, and it was great to work on another project together. Hilary's ability to think through things logically and see the bigger picture was so helpful in this project, when we were still learning how to break out components in React. I liked the balance we had of working together on some parts, and splitting up other work. Hilary doesn't give up on challenges and has a great approach to problem solving, and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

### Nimble Network

4 - Zero complaints

#### Feedback from Kristen:
This was my second time working with Hilary, and this experience on our final project was absolutely as positive as the first one! She has a way of approaching problems and writing code that is very logical and easy to follow. She works very hard and is deeply persistent in solving any problem put in front of her. I never once had any fear that our project was going to be done on time and, furthermore, done quite well. Hilary has a particular knack for keeping a project organized from start to finish, keeping everyone on task and and on the same page throughout the process. She is an awesome team member, and I hope to work together more in the next two modules!

#### Feedback from Kinan:
Working with Hilary has been a great pleasure. Her ability push through projects and features in uncanny, as she is certainly determined to succeed accomplish as much as possible. Hilary's understanding of approaching the project from individual and group perspectives made for a nice balance between both work styles. During some stressful moments of getting features implemented, Hilary offered a supportive approach. If she could improve on anything it would be to slow down to go faster. At times I felt like she wanted to get things on the app before we wrote a line which made for some potentially unneeded pressure. I think there is some room for communicating more effectively with teammates while in the nitty-gritty of collaborating and being more open to the benefits of pairing as a team. Overall, Hilary offers a healthy pace to her process and works very well individually. This allowed for a sense of real ease into dividing and conquering which was definitely refreshing. In our team, she demonstrated strong initiative and skillful planning. Overall, I am confident Hilary will be an asset to future teams and have had a great pleasure working with her.

#### Feedback from Graham:
I enjoyed working with Hilary on 2DoBox. Though we had a few bumps in the road, such as my getting food poisoning the night before the project was due, I feel that we had a good workflow. In a future project, though, I think that we would benefit from starting testing and refactoring earlier. In particular, I think that some of our production-stage bugs could have been avoided if we'd begun testing earlier. Overall, though, it was great to partner with Hilary, and I hope to work together again.

-----------------------
## D: Professional Skills
Each Friday at Turing I took part in Gear Up which was a time for us to study and discuss certain topics related to web development and society. I found it very beneficial to collaborate and discuss these topics with others in the community because it helped me become more aware of these important things and implement it in my everyday life.

### Gear Up
#### Vote your Conscience
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown

How would you describe the rights and responsibilities of US citizen to their country and fellow citizens?
* I really love how the article by Brett and Kate McKay, A Citizen's Bill of Responsibilities describes this topic. I love how they spell out some of the responsibilities that are attendant to the rights contained in our nations, state, and local laws. I believe it is important to have a balance between rights and responsibilities within any type of community, just as I did growing up. I believe that a lot of Americans believe they should only have rights and not any responsibilities and that is where a lot of our issues are in this nation right now.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of introverts? How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of extroverts?
* We need both to find a balance between extroverted and introverted ways of thinking.
* I think its important for both to step outside of their comfort zones to experience both sides.

How can you leverage the strengths of introverts and extroverts in your future projects and future career?
* It is always important to listen to each other more and understand if the people in your team are introverted or extroverted before a project begins so you can understand them better.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Company Tracker
I have a  Trello board to keep track of all of the companies I am interested in. I log their emails, blogs, websites, twitter, phone numbers and github accounts for individuals I am interested in reaching out to within the company.

So far, I have 19 companies on my Trello board. I have reached out to a total of 4 of them by sending emails or DMs via slack to either people I know who have a connection to the company or people directly in the company.

#### Project Management and Feedback Strategies
I use agile practices with each of my projects. As a DTR in each group, we discuss the best way to use agile practice so have the most success with our project. I make sure when working a specific functionality, we test, make it work, style, refactor, and add accessibility.

I use waffle to organize the tasks we need to get done and break up different functions of each individual in the group to work on.  I have found that if everyone in the group uses waffle and communicates consistently with each other about agile practices, we are able to make a very good project productively. Things go wrong when people don't communicate well about what files they are working on and when they are merging things into the master.

Through communication in a project, I try to encourage feedback to how everyone if feeling about the task they are working on. I also try encourage everyone to keep open communication about when working on a function. Through feedback I have found that I can sometime work at a faster pace than other in a project and I need to take step back sometimes to make sure I am organizing myself and my group so we are most successful.

-----------------------
## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
#### Feedback to Christine:
Christine is always someone I love to work with. She is one of the best communicators when it comes to working in a team setting remotely. She makes sure I understand every line of code she implements into a project by communicating the logic clearly to me and others who are looking at her code. She is able to work at a quick and efficient pace through projects while implements DRY code. Christine has a lot of offer a team and I look forward to working with her again soon.

#### Feedback to Kristen:
Kristen is always fun to work with on projects. She always has a positive attitude, good communication, and she is really good at testing. I appreciated that Kristen worked so hard on testing constantly throughout the project. Although we had a couple of bumps in the road at the end of the project getting everything merged, I found my experience working on this project with Kristen particularly successful.

#### Feedback to Kinan:
Kinan is always fun to work with on projects because he is very careful and mindful of his work. He is able to think very logically about problems to find the best solution. He worked very hard on the image function and I really appreciated it. Although we had a couple of bumps in the road at the end of the project getting everything merged, I found my experience working on this project with Kinan particularly successful.

#### Feedback to Graham:
Graham was wonderful to work with on 2DoBox. He is very smart and makes sure to get the job done quickly and efficiently. He is good a talking me through every aspect of the project and he consistently makes sure we are on the same page with every single line of code. I wish we had more time for the project so Graham and I could have more time to refactor and shorten our code. Graham has a lot to offer a team and he is one of the hardest workers I have worked with yet.

### Being a Community Member
#### Feedback from Chelsea:
I had the opportunity to work with Hilary on Weatherly. Being the first React project, it was difficult and challenging. I admire how Hilary is willing to dive right into a project. We worked through challenges effectively and learned a lot during the project. Hilary has been a great SAB rep - she's been great at communicating information and listening to feedback!

#### Student Advisory Board Representative
I took on the obligation of being an SAB (Student Advisory Board) member for the second module in the row. I attended meetings to discuss feedback surveys which I sent out to my cohort weekly about things Turing can do to improve student experience. I also led student retros each week to discuss things we went over in our meetings to effectively communicate to students what staff is implementing to improve student experience at Truing.

### Playing a Part
Throughout this module, and similar to my reflection from last module, I want to take a greater role in the push towards encouraging women to be in the tech industry. I want to be role model and encouraging young girls that programming and math is cool. Considering my background, I think this is something that would be very beneficial.
