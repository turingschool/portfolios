## Area of Emphasis

_What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?_

This inning, I really wanted to improve my front-end skills, specifically with updating a given page without reloading. Obviously, this draws on JavaScript, AJAX, and some jQuery. On day one, I had basically no idea how to implement this, though I was familiar with the theory of how to do it.

After all our different projects, I feel quite comfortable with this process. Not an expert, but I can do it.

I also wanted to go much deeper in Rails, and do all of this front-end stuff without page reloading in the context of a rails app. Success!

Oh, and job things.

I've got some strong leads for jobs, and am in discussions with a small software company for paid contracting work.

I don't see the contracting as the end goal (at all) but I see it as a great way to boost my credibility in the industry, and develop tons of interesting talking points for full time work after.

Also, I'm not really ready to jump into full-time work. My wife and I have a few weddings to attend, and we'll be out of town for most of the first month after Turing, so doing contract work for a well-connected group of people will serve me well, perhaps better than a full-time job would.


## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

#### Assessment Outcome: Conditional

I've got some final details to wrap up on the assessment, and then it'll be a passing grade.

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

It was frustrating moving so slowly.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

I enjoyed writing what I did, and getting much of the needed functionality to work.

I really like using unit/integration tests to drive development.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

I enjoyed having a long block of time to work on it. I enjoyed that it was spread over two days.

* **What did you learn?**

I really need to dig into JavaScript. I still don't have a good mental framework for it, which is causing me pain as I move farther along with software development.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

Switching stacks entirely left me little mental framework to rely upon. I understood Rspec and the HTTP request/response cycle, but everything else was foreign.

I would have preferred a project that kept me in Rails, and integrated AJAX and DOM manipulation before jumping stacks entirely to Node and Express. I didn't learn as much as I would have preferred, and wrote a bunch of crappy code.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

Unfortunately, just trial and error.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

Modifying the page without a refresh.

* **What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?**

1. Type-ahead filtering, while highlighting the matched portion of the word.
2. AJAX calls based on the four HTTP verbs.
3. Writing better semantic HTML to let me find/modify elements later.


* **If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?**

Know some freaking Javascript before starting the project. That was my fault, no one elses.

* **What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?**

It was fine. I'm glad for the opportunity, I would have struggled much more without Colleen. She was more knowledgable than me, and was able to bring me up to speed on various concepts, instead of me just flailing. I was (and am) very thankful for her partnership.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

#### What was your biggest technical challenge?

1. Translating data between the canvas and lat/long coordinates to render on google maps. I had to go both directions, first to take canvas brush strokes and store in my DB, and then back from the DB to the canvas after a page reload.
2. Calculating "painted" areas, based on user input. Very hard to "bound" a region and then do math against the contents.

#### How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

1. Stack overflow, talking to other developers, and a few different spike branches on different solutions.


#### What did you like the most about the challenge?

That no one else has done this, or anything quite like this (at least, to my knowledge) so I was very much doing an original and challenging project.

#### What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

1. HTML5 Canvas
2. Encoding/decoding pageX/Y coordinates to lat/long coordinates.
3. Doing match on html5 elements.

## Feedback

_What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?_

I bombed one of my technical challenges in a practice interview, so I spent a bunch of time brushing up on Ruby. I'd forgotten it all since mod 3.

## Gear Up

_Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?_

Planning the gear up was fine. I didn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. I've enjoyed spikes led by mod 4 students in the past, so I didn't mind doing the same thing as those students when in their shoes.

Nothing was particularly challenging. Ellen Mary did a great job of facilitating and supporting all of us.

We talked about "how to give back", and it was cool watching other's support of me (students one mod ahead) come full circle, as I've tried to help others, and then see them planning how to help students behind them.

I'm sure this trend will continue.

The one note I have is it's obvious some people don't enjoy being "on the spot". It's good to talk openly about things, but i think our particular gear up session was underwelming, because of how uncomfortable some of us were speaking to the whole class.

I'd rather make mod 4 gearup planning optional. I would have participated - I've led a spike every mod at Turing, and always had a blast, and they've been well attended and well reviewed. This particular session was, by far, the worst one I've participated in.


## Community Involvement

_How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?_

#### Learning Spike

Joseph Glass and I led a spike on learning how to learn[gist of my notes](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/f7505c0c078c9af25d6d7b16c80971c6), on the very first Friday of the mod. I expanded it into a [blog post](http://josh.works/learning-how-to-learn)

We invited mods 1 && 2, and had a [ton of people turn up]().

We got lots of positive feedback, along the lines of

>this framework and these tools will substantively change how I approach learning at Turing

This was *exactly* what we wanted to accomplish, and it was cool to get to play a very small roll in the Turing experience of these 30 or 40 people.

#### Pairing w/students in other mods

Paired w/others in our mod, or FE mods on backend topics.

## Going Forward

_What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?_

1. Writing detailed guides to things
2. AJAX && jQuery/JavaScript
3. Reading technical books
