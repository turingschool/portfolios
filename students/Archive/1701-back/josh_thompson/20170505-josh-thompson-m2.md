# Josh Thompson - M2 BE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to wrap my head around Rails, and I did. I can confidently make ActiveRecord associations, render pages, style everything with HTML/CSS, etc.

I enjoyed the mod, and how heavy it was with re-exposure to similar concepts. I feel like I really drilled Rails into my head.

One of the biggest wins was just feeling comfortable with Rails. It felt so daunting when I started, so to now be sort of comfortable with the basics is great! I've got tons of work to do, but I am encouraged.

I enjoyed pairing with Mod 1 students, and I gave a well-attended Friday Spike as well. (More info below.)

One of the highlights was giving a lighting talk after wrap-up on the topic of _mastery_. [These are the notes for that talk](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/65802ebf3c90025b113b52cbf6a79c71)

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 4 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3.5 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

I've been active in getting mentoring and advice from graduates. I've got a practice technical interview schedule for break week, and I've been slowly cultivating a professional network.

I met with Maya, one of just a few students in mod 2, to talk about job things. Immediately implemented her advice.



-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | 3.8 |
| **Written Diagnostic** | 4.5 |

I enjoyed pairing with Beth on the end-of-mod assessment.

Some of her specific feedback was encouraging, related to how I broke apart functional pieces of logic in the application, and it was also reassuring that I _have_ learned a lot over the mod, even though it's always felt like I'm a certain distance behind what's being taught. (My score was all 4s and a 3, hence the 3.8)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:

[Understanding (and breaking) D3](https://josh.works/blog/tour-of-d3) <= published on my website, but with bad code formatting and image handling.

I wrote it originally [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/e02242b959f0422077c801cef02ab838) and the formatting is way better than on my blog.

I might move to jekll soon...

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master

Enjoyed both of these. After re-visiting MixMaster for the final assessment, it was almost comical how easy the things we had to do in the assessment were, compared to the first time through it following the tutorial.

I feel comfortable with the Rails basics.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project

Further solidifying my Rails knowledge. I'm eager to pick up new things, like APIs, and maybe more complext front-end stuff.



## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**

I only wish I'd known the real goodness of ActiveRecord... we would have finished the project 24 hrs early, instead of working until midnight the day of.

**Little Shop of Orders**

Learned a lot this time around. Using Waffleboard was a learning experience. I was PM'ing, and at the beginning, I was writing not-very-detailed cards for fixes, but quickly learned that the more detailed I can write them, the easier it is for someone else to pick it up and complete it.

I enjoyed the project, and found it to be not nearly as stressful as most of the other projects we've had.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

**Jonathan:**
I am so glad you were on the team for this project - your willingness and skill to jump into problem, pry it out or whatever, was an enormous asset, and your calm, collected head in the face of any “problem” we ran into really helped me (and the team) keep things in perspective. One area you could work on in the future is finding a way to share what you learn/try independently with the group, even if just an overview of the rabbit hole and what did/didn’t work.

**Seth**
Josh it was great you were able to meet before hand with me and set up our work schedule. It really helped that you were able to communicate well quickly understood new concepts. You could work on TDD and pseudocoding to help you make your programs better, and don't forget to take small breaks when working for really long periods of time. If you keep going how you are with those two small changes you'll be on a good track.

**Stephanie:**
Josh: I really appreciate your positive, “who-cares-if-things-get-fucked-up” attitude. I would like to embody this kind of spirit more often- focusing less on completing each iteration perfectly, and rather trying interesting things and learning new stuff.  Thanks for your patience, your willingness to ask questions, your eagerness to share what you’ve learned, your ability to mediate group dynamics, and the ease with which you balance stress levels!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

**Chris**

> Josh, I think you made a great project manager.  You knew how to talk to us and communicate what you wanted.  You were respectful and worded any criticisms well.  Thank you for being encouraging and helping me when I was stuck.  Your calm nature and approach to things is a breath of fresh air.

**Seth**

> It's has been nice working with you and with your consistant ability to stay on task and not get distracted has been really helpful in keeping myself from doing those. It has also been nice exchanging keyboard shortcuts and other valuable computer navigation tricks with you.




## D: Professional Skills

Half of what goes into a job is our professional skills. I really enjoy thinking and trying to improve at things like this, so this portion of the curriculum was enjoyable to me.

#### **Professional Development Workshops**

- Warm Outreach:
https://gist.github.com/josh-works/b29bc4f55c566f68f093cc63d49132b0
- Agile workflow:
https://gist.github.com/josh-works/237201000b66086e40c12cbbc18e6dd1
- In-person feedback:
https://gist.github.com/josh-works/8c2fec8a933cea0766555c0baaf6ff26

#### **Gear Ups**

Empathy is hard. It's also easiest to empathize with people who are like us, and its hard to imagine seeing the world any other way. But true empathy (distinct from sympathy) is to try to be where the other person is, and without judgement, say "yeah, that is hard."

Brene Brown had a great youtube video on this, btw: [Brené Brown on Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw)

**Grit**

Grit can be overrated, especially when it becomes the goal instead of something that helps along the way. I.E. as I read about grit (and I've been exposed to it, and even read books on it before Turing) I'd read about public schools trying to "teach grit", which is, I think, entirely backwards.

Grit should come into play when students really want to learn something, or accomplish something, it shouldn't be coopted by mostly-useless institutions where kids are trapped...

I love the idea of grit at a place like Turing, where attendance is optional and we're all treated as adults and have a real benefit by learning. Trying to make a group of 3rd graders use "grit" to study for math homework... is dumb.

**Automation**

First things first, there's no "standard" definition of "Automation". It's like rice - it takes on whatever flavor you cook it in. It was difficult to discuss without people just rolling their emotions into it, because it is so impossible to define.

That said, I foudn the discussion to be interesting and wide-ranging. Some people feel good about it, some feel bad. Some feel like our jobs as programmers will be endangered, I feel like my job will never be negatively impacted by "automation".

It was fun seeing some more of the mod4 folks, talking with them a bit.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

**Stephanie**
> Very clear planning! You’re great at making sure we had solid ideas on what we were working on.
>
> Possible: Feel free to be more assertive, but understand that that could be a very personal thing from me. You could do that, and in the next project be told “be less assertive!“. So, you do you. Know that you’ll excel and do great work if you do or don’t take action on this idea.

**Seth**
> You’re really good at seeing the underlying logic. Every time you helped us debug our views, you were seeing object types that I couldn’t. I was (and am) impressed with your ability to follow threads through the code.
>
> Work on your listening/active listening skills. Those will serve you well, and you will be able to better work with others on projects.

**Jonathan**
> You are Rreally thoughtful and methodical. I most enjoyed pairing directly with you on Sunday and Tuesday.
>
> I’d encourage you to be more assertive with your ideas and directions. You’re very attentive to what your partner is thinking, but don’t ever give them so much space that you’re sacrificing some of your “own” time, if that makes sense.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

**Seth**

> Seth! This was our what... fourth project together? I've really enjoyed working with you, and continue to be impressed by how quickly you crush those waffle cards and piece together complex logic.
>
> I look forward to working with you again down the road. Since we're supposed to have recommendations, I'd recommend (again) working on listening. Sometimes when we'd be chatting with Andrew or Beth or Jorge, you'd ask a question, then they'd start to give a response, and then you'd interrupt to add more info about your question. Not a huge deal, but since they're the experts, it's generally best to let them finish their thought before jumping in again.
>
> Your technical skills are top notch. I've enjoyed them!

**Chris**

> Chris! I enjoyed getting to work with you on Little Shop. Thanks for your work, and for your patience with us all.
>
> I appreciated the calmness that you brought to the table, and your constant willingness to figure out what you needed to work on, and your care at managing all the branches and waffle cards well. It's sometimes a bit hard on the team when one person just launches off in one direction without any input from others, so I appreciate how intentional you were with regards to that.
>
> We're supposed to have recommendations in here, so I'd recommend figuring out how to make your ruby linter highlight only real problems, instead of more-or-less everything. Also, take a crack at customizing your terminal prompt to allow you to more quickly find your input and separate it from what's being printed to the screen.


#### **Posse**

- I participated in a few front-end spikes, and Wozniak.
- My favorite spike was one on web scraping, led by mod3 be.
- I'm a fan of teaching what I know, and think that this teaching ability will serve me well in the professional world, so as I begin my job hunt, my ability to actively participate in groups led by others, coupled with my ability to lead groups (in areas where I have some familiarity) should serve me well.


#### **Playing a Part**

1. I led a spike on how to reach out to people via email, setting up coffee dates, and how to handle them once they're scheduled. There were ~40 people there. (!!!), and everyone said they enjoyed it and found it helpful. [Notes for the spike here](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/758e4d7babb082e446c888d8e00a40c2)

2. I paired with mod-1 students 2-3/x week, and joined in some group discussions as they were studying more complex topics, like hashes.

3. Before their mod started, I shared [these thoughts(gist)](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/9366bece56a2b10a814ec727a8f6b45e) in their channel, and also heard that this was a useful guide. Also: [Learning how to learn](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/ea3be735b150710017f28baf75703407)
4. I got proactive in inviting folks from mods 1/2 Frontend/backend out to the park near Turing for lunch. Some days we had more than 20 people out there, and a few folks thanked me for taking the initiative to invite everyone out. For just the "price" of a few slack messages in their channel, I was pleased with the result.
