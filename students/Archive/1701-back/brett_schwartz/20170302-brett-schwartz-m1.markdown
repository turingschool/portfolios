# Brett Schwartz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The first area of emphasis for me this module was to improve my problem solving skills. The morning exercises definitely helped me improve these skills. I plan on continuing to develop these skills through future exercisms and codewars.

The second area of emphasis for me was learning ruby syntax and fundamentals of the language. I continue to get better each day within these two domains. I need to focus on gradually getting better at this everyday and continue to gain knowledge in the field.

#### Assessor Comments (Beth Sebian)

* Testing solid, fundamentals strong
* Through i2
* For testing, may be helpful to use setup method. Also, only need one example (go for minimum) to verify functionality. In many of these tests you instantiate 2 objects to test. Minor point.
* Look to use reduce without map next time
* Regular committing
* Not sure why your highest_grossing_actor method is working, but it is... The way you wrote it, it should return an ordered array, but your tests pass

### Pair Feedback

**Night Writer (Stephanie Bentley)**

> Overall I felt like this was a really successful first paired project.I felt like we were on the same page for pretty much everything. I thought communication was good and time was well managed.  I also think we did a good of evenly balancing the workload and sharing responsibilities. Specifically, you were patient with me when it came to GitHub. I totally messed up my branches, and you didn’t get upset or frustrated. You just sat down and helped sort things out.  You were also really good about making sure you understood what was confusing you about the project. For example, with the File IO stuff, right away you said “I want to make sure I really understand this, because it tripped me up in the last project.”  Also, when we came back with different pieces of the project working, you were intent on making sure you understood the pieces I brought back. I also think your willingness to persevere and tackle difficult problems (both together and independently) allowed us to make progress each day. What could be better? I think we both let ourselves “give in” a little bit a the end of the last night. We may have leaned on Jasmin too heavily the last night, and we could have been more motivating for each other to clean things up (refactor longer methods, get capitals working) at the end.

**Black Thursday (Josh Thompson)**

  > It was a pleasure working with you on this project, Brett. I really enjoyed the process of learning the basics about items and their associated repositories, and then linking and populating objects with data from the CSVs. I feel like we both had a good pace throughout the project. We didn't rush, and made sure we had understanding the whole time, but still made good speed. I love how we tested everything, both from a TDD perspective, and from a "throw a pry in there and see what happens." You made huge contributions to the project by being able to link our objects and traverse between them in ways that I was completely unable to see. It seems like for every single iteration, when we got held up by difficult-to-finish methods, I would have nothing, and you'd pull great ideas out and we'd implement 'em. I enjoyed how quick you are to just stick it out and do work, like the last night of the project, and two days before that. We just... banged out a lot of not-bad code, and you did it with a completely content attitude. I know now project evaluation is completely useful without ways to improve, but it's hard to find any useful recommendations on things to do. So, I'm really scraping the bottom of the bucket trying to find something to recommend, but I was able to think of two things: First, you might want to look up and add tab autocomplete for your git commands. That way, when typing something like git push origin iteration_four_cleanup_branch you can type git push or[tab] ite[tab], and it'll auto complete the rest of those words. There's a few other cool git aliases you can add that reduce the typing burden, like gs for git status, or gb for git branch, etc. Second, maybe run through some Typing.io ruby exercises. I've spent a ton of time on there, and it's helped be able to more quickly type as I think, without having to think about the typing. The time difference isn't much. I mean, we could re-type the last week of work in just an hour or two, but it makes a difference in how you think as you type. I mention this mostly because I'm in the same boat, and still don't do well with some of the odd characters. Thanks Brett! I had a blast, and would do another project with you,
  gladly, in a heartbeat. Maybe we'll have a chance to do more.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
I enjoyed this Gear Up a lot because it closely relates to my undergraduate focus: Neuroscience Psychology. It was very interesting to see how the neurons in the brain act differently in a fixed mindset brain vs. growth mindset brain when faced with a challenge.
For myself, past experiences have encouraged both fixed/growth mindsets.
The first fixed mindset experience that comes to mind is being 'let go' from my previous job. That decision told my mind that 'sales' isn't for me and i'm not good at it.
A past experience that led to a growth mindset was playing on the same basketball team as kids from Brooklyn. It opened my eyes that there were kids that were much more talented than me and I wanted to play with them to improve my skill level.
I move into a fixed mindset when I get overwhelmed and don't see an easy solution. I need to focus on staying calm, understand the problem, break it down into separate elements, and then begin working on a piece.


#### Session 2: Getting Better At Hard Things
Overall, this Gear Up session was very interesting. The concept that all cognitive energy is stored in one tank stuck with me after the session. From now on while taking a break from coding, I will step away from the computer to give my eyes a rest.
While managing my learning process, I try not to get to high/low with my emotions. By keeping my emotions stable, it helps me focus on what's next without thinking about my previous successes/failures. Even though I ideally don't want to look backwards, I find myself still doing it from time to time.
With coding, there is always more to learn, there are no unicorns. Everyone has to start at the beginning but the ceiling is infinite so you're always going to be faced with new challenges.
It's much easier to take in new information when your emotional state is in a healthy place. When your cognitive energy is being strained by other stresses, its' harder to learn.

#### Session 3: Stress Management
We started off this gear up by recalling a time during the week where our growth mindset was challenged. Mine was challenged during our NightWriter project after a long day of working we still didn't include the capital feature into our last iteration.
We were then asked to recall a time where we successfully implemented our growth mindset. My example was going back to File I/O concepts that we learned in the previous week that I didn't feel comfortable with and doing drill on them until I felt more comfortable.
A way I can better manage stress is to better organize what concepts I need to work on. A specific example of this is to write down concepts i'm having issues with and have these topics be the focus of my pairing sessions.
In general, I need to improve my communication to help relieve my stress. When I decided I wanted to come to Turing, it put a lot of stress on myself, family and girlfriend. I thought my communication was open with my roommate but not so much with my parents and girlfriend. I had a hard time explaining my motivation and that caused a lot of internal stress. Now that i'm here, i'm trying to be more open with my communication so everyone understands my motivations better.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories and Connections
At the beginning of this gear up we were asked to write about what brought us to Turing. I reflected on the thoughts I had while looking for a new career path to embark on. I wanted to come to Turing b/c of the community-driven approach they preach, my interest in technology and wanted to learn a "hard" skill.
Next we were asked to identify what lenses we view the world from most often. I reflected that I see the world firstly from my own view then my families and then lastly from my religion/community. Values that drive me are fulfillment, being self-sufficient and teamwork

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
I have been overly impressed with the outreach from other Turing students during my 1st five weeks at Turing. Mod 4 students are not your typical "High School Senior". They are offering help at every turn; spike sessions, pairing sessions and are always available to chat.
I try to be as inclusive as possible in our cohort and the Turing community. I'm always available to give guidance/assistance since I am always asking other people and they always help. I also try to be friendly to people I don't know in other classes b/c we can be of value to each other as either friends or teammates down the road.
The only instance of malicious intent in the Turing community has been teammates talking bad about each other. The rest has been extremely positive.

### Community Participation
I have been an active voice in all gear up sessions as well as strength finder sessions. As I mentioned in my gear up summaries, my undergraduate education relates closely with Turing's gear up and community initiatives. I actively participated in all student led spikes, retros and SAB sessions. In mode 2, I look forward to having the opportunity to lead a spike. During this module I took advantage of the pairing sessions with Jasmin as well as other Turing students. Moving forward I look forward to helping future mod 1 students in pairing sessions.
