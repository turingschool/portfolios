## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
>* Personally, I haven’t dealt with much mircroaggressions in life. I would say that I have been questioned on why I want to be a developer b/c i’m not nerdy enough or love math. The tech industry does seem to have big stereotypes about it that are not really true. As tech becomes more mainstream and ‘cool’ these stereotypes are getting better.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
>* I’m not sure exactly how it would effect the job market if tech executives only hire developers similar to them. I would argue that it would make the teams less diverse and lead to the power of group norms that this exercise speaks to. People enjoy working with teammates that they have similar interests with and get along with. This can lead to less diversity in the workplace so it is a tough balance to find. Effective strategies to counteract bias would be to hire people in groups where diversity already exists. Potp’s goals are to show how important slight individual biases play in the larger scheme of things. It also show that people prefer to "live" in a diverse environment with others who have slightly other opinions.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
>* Interesting to see how in the show social media likes became a currency that was more important than money. The tech industry is going to have to become more ehtical in the future.
