###Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

    - Showing up to class on time
    - Communicating with instructors
    - Completing assignments on time  
    - Go to meet-ups

### Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

    This assessment, I have done now twice, and this time I can say I felt way more confident going into it.
    Although there was some shake ups with my computer and that didn't help my confidence levels, I was
    proud of the work I did. I was both proud and kind of shocked that I could do all of the necessary javascript needed to get
    the assessment done. At points I would get pretty upset about the circumstances and the requirements of the assessment
    but I got through it, and I was happy that it went as well as it did seeing as I had to reinstall everything.
    The hardest part of the assessment for me was making the first api call. I spend a good half a day on it, and it was extremely
    frustrating, but it turns out I just needed to require jQuery. It was also frustrating pushing things to production; when
    I used localhost as host and then changed it to the production url. It wasn't updating. Finally we figured out that
    I needed to clobber and re-precompile my assets and that would update the links on production. It was nice to finally get that
    figured out.

### Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

    What was your biggest technical challenge?
      - Getting contentEditable to work and persisting it to the database

    How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
      - Well first we tried what was obvious, when it didn't work we looked it up,
      when the internet's answers weren't working we tried something very simple and the
      contentEditable worked, and for the update we wound up asking a peer for how they approach it
      and we wound up having to restructed some backend code and then it worked.

    What did you like the most about the challenge?
      - The satisfaction of it being completed

    What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
      - Testing in javascript
      - How routing in javascript can be organized and why it is organized the way it is in other languages  
      - Patience :)

    If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
      - I wish we broke more things out into different files so that is was dry and well organized
    What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
      - Hard, we rabbit holed a ton, but it was nice to have someone to struggle with.

### Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

    Reflection:
      - I was really disappointed with this project, because when it started I
      choose something that I was very much interested and would have been a good
      challenge for me, but I had computer problems, and things were far behind schedule, so we decided to do a different project, a password manager,
      and while that was far easier to do, I wasn't nearly as attached to it, and
      I had so much going on that I didn't get a chance to make it my own. The most
      disappointing part was that it was Monday night and my website was in absolute
      terrible shape, I had essentially run out of time, and it wasn't even in an
      MVP status, and I had already pulled an all nighter to get it to where it was.
      But, I couldn't let myself turn in that project in the current shape it was in
      so I buckled down Monday night, and as the sun rose on Tuesday, I had a still buggy and partly implemented application, but it was something. I used bootstrap
      which I had never willing done on my own, and it looked like an actual site.
      When evaluation came I was shocked by the scores I had gotten, but proud that
      I had made a thing, a small thing, but still in that time frame. This project
      reassured me that I had not in fact lost touch with Rails which is something I worried about.

    What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
      - spring
      - code climate

### Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

    Valerie, thanks for the many times you reviewed my code and answered my questions. I was lucky to have a partner that knew JavaScript as well as you do! I learned a lot from this project, and especially from the way you organized our app into MVC and classes.
    Occasionally (well, frequently) we’d run into bugs and asynchronous errors, and it was definitely frustrating. Here’s one piece of advice that has helped me: “Every output has a reason, and every bug has a solution. ”
    Now, it’s not always possible to find the reason, or worthwhile to fix it, but just remembering that helps me check my assumptions and step through the code line by line.
    Thanks again for all the effort and skills you brought to our team!

### Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
    The gear up session I was apart of did giving back to the community. I had a
    fun time doing it I felt that the people I planned it with were happy to be
    there and excited about tell people about getting involved. It was challenging
    having so much going on, and trying to get this gear up together. If we had more time
    I know for sure I would have been far better, but I think due to time and
    resources we just didn't have a ton of time to delve in and make the gear up the most
    that it could be. It was rewarding to see everyone actually engage and get
    excited about the topic. When we first started out they all had different idea
    about what it meant to give back and by the end we were able to leave them with some
    meaningful things they could all do. 


### Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

  Beside running a gear up, I attended meet-ups around Denver, mostly security focuses, started a blog, and found some online communities
  that I will be involved in and start to answer questions such as stack overflow, and ruby irc forums. I think the community part of Turing is important to have to that we leave Turing with a connection to the community while we wont always have instructors right there to answer our questions; people from the community can answer questions and provide some support as well.

### Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

  1. Learning security specifically pen-testing
  2. Learning python
  3. Learn how to make email server
