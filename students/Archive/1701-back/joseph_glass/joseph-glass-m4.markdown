# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

This mod I wanted to push myself to learn a new language and experiment with functional programming. This being my last mod, I wanted to learn as much as possible and prepare for the job search. I also wanted to become a more well-rounded programmer and do comprehensive solo projects to put into my portfolio.

## Assessment
Outcome: Pass

I had some issues with scope during the assessment, when I needed to grab two arrays with jQuery and compare them with an `inArray()` or `includes()` method. I was having trouble passing the different arrays through my functions. It was frustrating to know the exact chain of logic that I needed, but not to know the syntax to follow it. I knew there was a way, but due to time constraints I decided to just perform the task using simple JavaScript loops. The experience reinforced for me the idea that JavaScript is flexible enough to perform the same task in a dozen different ways.

## Quantified Self
By far the biggest challenge we faced in Quantified Self was testing. Learning JavaScript and jQuery was difficult on its own, but when working with the DOM directly there was a level of concreteness, you could see what you were trying to do. In selenium testing, however, we had a new DSL and layer of asynchronicity to worry about on top of all the problems and uncertainty of Javascript. Due to our inexperience, we spent precious time trying to test what we didn't yet understand. That led to slower feedback and an additional layer of tests to muddle through.

The best part of the project was coming out with a much stronger knowledge of Javascript, front-end debugging, and asynchronicity.

If I could redo the project, I would have spent more time learning fundamentals and studying high-quality examples before diving into the complex parts of the project. I think more research time would have paid out good dividends.

## Capstone Project


The biggest technical challenge of my capstone was putting together tagging through a polymophic many-to-many joins that could work with my various models. I researched different ways of handling the tags, but decided against using a gem in order to get a more in-depth practice with activerecord associations. I read the rails docs, several tutorials, and combined several different techniques to make a useful, DRY tagging system. Another big hurdle was handling bugs in my production environment that arose dealing with the d3 and c3 libraries. Among the new techniques I experimented with in this project are heroku add-ons, nested form attributes, polymorphic associations and c3.js chart visualizations.


## Feedback

During a mock interview, a mentor advised me to pause before speaking and really listen to the question. It seemed like a simple thing, but has made a significant difference in my communication. Since then I've tried to take a moment and really absorb and consider what is being asked of me instead of jumping in with the first response that comes to mind. It's made me address the actual motive of the question, rather than its surface features, and has helped me to express myself more clearly and concisely.

## Gear Up

I was lucky to have an engaging topic and motivated members in our Gear Up  group.  Victoria Vasys in particular did an amazing amount of organization that helped make our session a success. The most challenging part was doing the Gear Up in such a hectic part of the module; I wish we could have done it earlier. By far the best part was watching everyone dive into a new language together.


## Community Involvement

I've tried to give back to the community by supporting students from lower mods in my posse, answering questions, giving encouragement and feedback.  I also gave a lighting talk on expertise, both because I think the topic is important and because I feel lighting talks added a lot to my experience in my earlier mods. It's clear that Turing wouldn't be half as successful as it is without the generous and selfless mindset of everyone involved. I'm grateful for the people who spent time and energy on helping me when there was nothing I could offer in return, and I'm glad to have the chance to pay a small part of that back to the community.

## Going Forward

There are many skills I've developed in Turing, but three that stand out are Self-directed learning, Algorithmic problem solving, and Technical communication. I've always enjoyed learning, but Turing has given me excellent tools for finding the best resources and using them in the most effective manner. Programming teaches a very methodical, reductive way of analyzing problems on their smallest level, then combining the pieces back together to consider the larger whole. Finally, my technical communication skills have definitely improved. I now know the vocabulary and protocols to communicate clearly with other programmers, taking into account the technical and human needs of communication.
