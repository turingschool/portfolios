-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

 **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
[Reddit Clone](https://github.com/glassjoseph/apicurious_reddit)
My APIcurious project was a basic clone of Reddit, an app built to consume Reddit's API and render articles, comments and scores. Main takeaways were third part API consumption and Omniauth authentication.

* The first roadblock in building this app was configuring the Omniauth gem, which required obtaining a developer API key and passing it in through a HTTP header. Reddit authorization tokens expire after an hour or two, requiring frequent reauthorizations during development. The api documentation was out of date but with some exploration and ingenuity I found all the endpoints I needed.

## B: Group Work & Projects

 **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
A TDDed Business Analytics API with over forty endpoints, combining API production with high-level ActiveRecord queries.

* The division of labor in the iterations helped us practice combining paired and solo work, while the increasing difficulty helped cement the principles of API design.

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
**[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/glassjoseph/grab_bag)**

[Heroku](http://grabbag-1701.herokuapp.com/)

[Sprint 2 Heroku](http://grabbag.herokuapp.com/)

GrabBag is a Dropbox clone that combined consuming and producing APIs, larger developer teams, and complex database relationships.

* This project involved a lot of completely new tools and frameworks. It was a great opportunity to learn independently and combine principles from separate sources. Self-referential and Polymorphic Associations, and file hosting were completely new to us.


 **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**

For Cloney Island Part 2, we inherited Corkboard, a brownfield clone of Thumbtack.

* Since this was a brownfield project, most of the design decisions had already been made before we started. It was a good learning experience to figure out how to integrate new features on an unfamiliar code base. I learned about the importance of clear documentation, the ability to read code, and building in as much design flexibility as possible. Having a built code base also allowed us to dive much deeper into narrower code principles.

Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
Good job using Application Helpers. You should namespace admin in routes for readability.

Cloney Island Sprint 2 evaluation comments:
You took risks, some paid off, some failed to make it to production. That happens on the job as well, keep pushing yourselves and keep improving.
Building on brownfield projects require you produce new features with code that was never designed with that end story in mind. Be flexible, balance tradeoffs, and understand as much about your inherited code base as possible.

## C. **Gear Ups**

 [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
 It's human nature to assume, to generalize, and to make assumptions. Be thoughtful and sensitive to others, particularly those who face systemic discrimination.


[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
It's hard to feel different or alienated from others. One of the best ways to mitigate this is to be aware and reach out to people at the edge of our society or friend group. Our group discussed how education, openness, strong group cohesiveness and collaboration make communities more welcoming for a variety of people. We all need to befriend and welcome people who are different from ourselves, and perhaps most especially those who we disagree with.


[Snowden & Privacy](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

Government agencies are responsible to the people and their duly elected representatives. If government officials lie to congress, then whistleblowers have the right to disclose documents proving the truth. That said, we live in an age where data is power. Leaks, particularly those involving hacking tools and exploits, need to be done carefully to ensure that they do not harm the very people they are meant to inform.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
Pairing in Mod 3 has been extremely valuable. I not only have more experience to work from, I also get more out of it, perhaps because Mod 1 was so long ago, and pairing keeps me from getting rusty on my ruby fundamentals. I was able to pair with students from earlier mods as well as several classmates from my own cohort. Pairing has taught me how to explain complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and has shown me the importance of using precise technical language.

#### **Posse**
My favorite Wozniak posse spike this mod was when we paired off to practice technical interview problems. The first few challenges were intriguing, but straightforward. After that, though, they got much harder. By the end, our entire spike was working together on incredibly difficult problem, breaking it down piece by piece and whiteboarding different approaches.
