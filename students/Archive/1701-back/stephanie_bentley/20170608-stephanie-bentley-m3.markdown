## Areas of Emphasis
My biggest takeaway this mod has been the experience and understanding gained from working with apis (see comments below).  I feel comfortable building an internal api within an app and consuming an external api within an app.

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | PASS |

| D | **Professional Development** | PASS |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | PASS |

Takeaways:
I feel stronger working in the rails environment at the end of this mod than at the end of last mod.  I feel comfortable making api calls- using and incorporating both internal and external apis in my apps.  I have enjoyed building applications this mod and feel like that I have learned quite a bit.  I do want to make an effort to incorporate some of the concepts from the lessons towards the end of this mod that I have not yet had the chance to implement in a project, for example background workers, caching methods, and mailers.

Takeaways:
This was a really fun project! I enjoyed working on a team with all women. I also enjoyed working on a larger app while also taking on an individual user story. For my user story, I learned how to incorporate a google-map with a location's pin into a show page on our app using the googlemaps api.  This was a fun challenge, because for the specific pin I needed an address.  Since our seed data did not have real addresses, this presented a problem.  I solved the problem by finding a csv file with all of the Target store locations (with full addresses) in the US. I read this into our seeds and randomly sampled the Target addresses for our property locations.  This allowed each property's show page to include a map with a pinned location.

Takeaways:
I thought the challenge of hopping into an already-built project was a really good experience! It was not easy to figure out all of the things that were going on in the new project; however, I know this experience will help me as I continue as a developer.  For this sprint, I took on a complicated user story that taught me a lot... I was able to figure out how to 1) hit dropbox's api connected to a specific dropbox user's account, and 2) take a file from the user's dropbox's api and post it into the grabbag app (without having to download it locally). This was a neat challenge.

## C. **Gear Ups**

1. Microaggressions
I think this was a very worthwhile conversation. In tech specifically, but in all industries, it can be easy to make assumptions and voice comments that- while intended or unintended- slight or offend others.  I think my takeaway from this conversation was twofold- 1 to pay close attention to my own words as well as those of my colleague, and  2 to work to create an environment that is welcoming for all.  If I can take action to support and give voice to those whose experiences might not be seen or heard, I will do that.  

2. Tragedy of the Commons
This simulation was the perfect tool for thinking about, dissecting, and analyzing this topic.  I loved that it was an example built by developers, too, rather than just an article or video.  I think my biggest takeaway from this gear-up was the idea that 'if you've been throwing food on the floor all week, just because you stop throwing food on the floor today doesn't mean your floor is now clean'.  In other words, we can't just stop doing the 'thing we've always done' and expect things to be different. Rather we need to take action in order for change to take place. We need to purposefully seek out other perspectives and other experiences beyond our own.

3. Choose your own adventure-"Black Mirror: What would you do for likes?"
This was an interesting gear-up.  I enjoy the Black Mirror TV show, so it was cool to get to pick apart the ideas and talk about the distopian "what could be" with other developers. While the story in the episode was a bit extreme, there is no doubt that people's lives are impacted by who and how many people 'like' their posts.  I don't think there is an easy fix here, either.  The cat is out of the bag, and Facebook likes, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are not going away.  There are two important conversations that need to take place around online (social media) content responsibility- one with companies (do we want to end up in a world where everyone is ranked like in the show?) and one with young people (I think they are particularly susceptible about what 'matters' online) about where self-worth, value, and importance should be derived.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

During this mod I co-led the Hamilton Posse.  We met regularly during Friday spikes to work on an application to replace the wellness spreadsheet.

#### **Posse**
  I have been leading the Hamilton Posse. We have been working on an app to replace the current spreadsheet where students can track their personal goals through a mod.  This was (and continues to be) a fun project! I am interested in health and wellness and enjoy building an app connected to this.  It has also provided another opportunity to practice building, testing, and implementing a rails application.

#### **Playing a Part**

I started a (small) running group. We usually run 2-3 times a week right after school for 30-45 minutes.  I created a slack channel for communicating and announcing runs.  There hasn't been too much participation by other students (yet!), but I hope to increase the running group's activity more next mod.
