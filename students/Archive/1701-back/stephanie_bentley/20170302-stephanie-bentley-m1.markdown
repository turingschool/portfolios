# Stephanie Bentley - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Mod 1 was to develop a basic understanding of the Ruby language and feel comfortable using it. I came into Mod 1 without any experience in computer science, programming, or coding. Before Mod 1 I had never written a program or piece of code, ever.
I feel that over the past six weeks I have developed a very basic understanding of Ruby. I know that there is much more to learn, but I am pleased with my progress so far and look forward to continuing to grow and learn more. One area I really want to improve upon is my understanding and "fluency" with Github.

#### Notes
Evaluator Comments:

  *  CreditCheck: talked about variables and methods to be created

  *  DateNight: Implementation showed struggles on grasping abstractions. Separation of concerns needed.Can explain implementation but struggles with problem solving from scratch.

  *  HTTP: Some opportunity to refactor by pulling html and messages out into a module of some sort.

My Comments:

  *  I think the biggest reflection I have on my scores is the progress I've made.  I was weak in a number of areas, but particularly Ruby style and refactoring. I have made progress in this area. I know I still have plenty of room to continue to grow, but I think this is one area that has developed significantly since my first project.

#### Notes
Evaluator Comments:

  *  NightWriter: Talked about some refactoring spots and longer methods (use of enumerables). Talked about how to push out a FileIO class. Talked about tests that don't rely on other methods. Unit testing.

My Comments:

  *  Ovearall I thought this first paired project was successful. We managed our time well, the workload was evenly balanced, we stuck to our DTR Expectations, and produced a working project with all minimum iterations complete.


## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CVHn2OMCBiU7UtIQrWXPglOd_UYWSUgOLczX6iNCruU/edit?usp=sharing) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

*   "NightWriter" (Brett Schwartz): Stephanie - It was a pleasure working with you for our first paired project at Turing. Starting with the DTR session, I thought you did a great job of initiating the outline, timeline and workflow for the project. When we hit road bumps in the project, (i.e. 80 char limit) I thought you did a great job of using outside resources to help guide us to the solution. Your effort was consistent throughout the week which helped us stay ahead of the Thursday deadline. As we spoke about, we could’ve improved our TDD process and started with tests instead of jumping right into the source code. Also, we could’ve improved the readability of our files so they would be easier for outside eyes to understand. Overall, it was a pleasure working with you and I look forward to working together down the road!

*   "Black Thursday" (Beth Knight): Dear Stephanie, You were such a great partner! You were there everyday working right beside me for the past two weeks. I appreciate you coming in on the weekend to bust this guy out. I never felt we had any communication problems. We ended up programming most of it together which worked out really well because we could catch little mistakes that could have held us back. I think you’re super strong with the enumerables, which is a difficult concept to grasp. I guess the only feedback I have would be to take a step back when we’re super stuck and maybe reach out for a new pair of eyes. I do the same thing where I start “throwing spaghetti at the walls”. Thanks for being my partner! I really enjoyed our time together!

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Growth mindset:
I am a total believer in the advantages of taking on a “growth mindset”. Of course it makes sense when we take time to stop and think about it, but, as we discussed, there are many triggers/stressors that quickly reset the brain back to a “fixed” mindset. In order to keep the growth mindset mentality while working through the next few weeks, I will need to be aware of these triggers/stressors. For me, a big one is when I read an assignment or project spec and feel overwhelmed. Often, I will have barely any grasp on the the expectation, let alone how I will meet that expectation.  When reading a spec or new material, I will have to consciously stay calm, and know that I have “been through this before”, and I have been able to tackle what may have looked like an insurmountable mountain. I also know I can’t let the new information freeze me.  I need to keep working, trying, testing, and just doing things in order to make progress. By making progress I will feel a sense of accomplishment which will help to counter feelings of inability/anxiety/etc.

#### Session 2
Getting better at difficult things/Cognitive resources:
The video we watched was reaffirming.  I have experienced exactly what she was talking about when she referred to “spending cognitive resources” and struggling to “get better at difficult things”. There is SO much that is SO new to me here at Turing. I could definitely relate! I also really connected to one particular line in the article Getting Better at Difficult Things. The author commented that, “hopelessness feeds the fatigue that leads the student to quit.”  I have been there!  That sense of hopelessness can catch you off guard.  And, it makes you feel like you’re not going to be able to make it.  But you are! The trick is not letting the hopelessness overtake your thoughts.  I thought the woman in the video gave some good advice for overcoming these feelings. My takeaway is to embrace the high quantity of exposure I will get here, even if I don’t get everything, the exposure will serve me in the long run. Whereas before, the high quantity exposure was overwhelming me. I am also fully embracing pairing and mentorship from others who know more.  This was reinforced in the video, too. Learning from experts helps move from “A to C” quicker.

#### Session 3
Growth mindset revisited:
It is hard to keep going after struggling for so long with a project/concept, especially when it’s just the first baby step of many, many in a long process. This gear up was well timed.  I needed to be reminded of what it looks and feels like to have a growth mindset.  Too many triggers were resetting my mind to forget these principles. Like the author of the article (last week) Getting Better at Difficult Things encouraged us to do,  I have to remember to ride the highs and celebrate the successes, no matter how small. This needs to be the motivation that squashes my self-doubt and thoughts like “I’m never going to get this” that push me onto the next (even more challenging) thing. I also appreciated the discussion on framing stress. I have done stressful things in my past.  I have struggled and achieved. I know I can do this again here at Turing.  It is not the same kind of “stress” or “struggle”, but I have mechanisms for handling stress and relieving stress.  I will make sure to take time, even when work is piling up, to exercise and see friends and family. These stress relievers, while taking up time, will, in the long run, be worth far more than just plugging away night and day on code.  

#### Session 4
What core values do you carry with you? Through what kind of a lense do you see the world?  Good questions!  My big takeaway from this Gear Up session, was that each of us answer these questions differently.  No matter how similar we may seem, we each have our own unique set of values and our own way of taking in the world and processing it.  We can take leverage these differences by taking advantage of our collective strengths.  But, at the same time, we need to keep in mind that, although we are community, we do not all come from the same place nor do we see things in the same way.  Remembering this will help us to be more empathic and more fully capitalize on those strengths.

#### Session 5
Although I struggled to stop thinking about my project this week, I really appreciated the video Debugging the Gender Gap. I think Turing is on the right track when it comes to this very important conversation. The first step is acknowledging what realities exist in the tech field, the next step is discussing and embracing "difficult" conversations, and then finally taking action to do something about it in order to make change.  This is the path I see Turing laying out. In fact, it was one of the deciding factors for me in choosing to attend Turing.  

### Community Participation
This mod has been a trial by fire.  I feel like one of the biggest ways I’ve engaged the community is reaching out for support.  I have attended all of the Joan Clarke Society meetings, and this has been a great thing. It’s not only been a great outlet for relieving stress, but also an awesome way to get to know a network of women here at Turing and out in the “real world”.  I have also reached out to upper mod students and mentors for pairings.  I benefited (a ton!) from these pairings.  I have made an effort to “pay it forward” from these sessions, too. For the first partner project after I paired one-one with a mentor, I was able to reteach a lot of what I had learned to my partner.  The same goes for the project HTTP; after a long pairing with a mentor I was able to help a small group of classmates who were stuck get started on the project.  In addition, I’ve attended some of the Pahlka meetings and “turing-game-time” meetings (when I can spare the time at lunch :) . Finally, I always try to leave the classroom and kitchen better than I found it. I load/unload the dishwasher, wipe up the counter, make coffee/dump out empty grounds, etc.
