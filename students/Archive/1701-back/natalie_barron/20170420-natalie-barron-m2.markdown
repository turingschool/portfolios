#### Blog Post:
The Next Industrial Revolution: Automation https://natbee.github.io/mod_2_technical_blog.html

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
  Blogger reinforced the many to many relationship for me. Both mix master and blogger helped me get some much needed practice using rails and testing.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
  Job tracker was good practice for me. The mini project was fun and I would have liked to spend more time fleshing it out.

## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**
  My team built a site for a bicycle share. This project was challenging because I didn't have a really good understanding of ActiveRecord at the time.  

**Little Shop of Orders**
  My team built an app that sells travel experiences. Working on this project was a good learning experience. It was nice to see everything we've learned tie together to make a cool site.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  From Erin Bassity:

  Natalie here’s my feedback for you from Bike-Share! I really enjoyed working on a team with you. Your positive attitude and commitment to our team were obvious throughout the project. I appreciated how you talk through what you’re doing when we are programming as a pair (or three-person pair in our case); your communication skills are strong. You were good at keeping us focused and project-managed our team much better than I did. :slightly_smiling_face: Thank you for an excellent experience all around.

  From Mark Stover:

  It am grateful that  we were on the same team on Bike Share. You consistently produced quality work which gave me confidence in our dividing and conquering techniques. You also are very skilled at talking through a difficult coding challenges, helping to identify the root of the problem. For me this was really helpful at the beginning of the project as we worked our way through the CRUD functionality. Lastly, it is apparent you have a strong handle on the Ruby language. This makes working through challenging problems, ie iteration 6 and on up, really fun. I really enjoyed our driver/navigator roles as we worked towards wrapping up our project. I find coding to be the most fun when the majority of brain power is working towards solving a logic problem, and is not distracted by syntactical or tool malfunctions. I think we found that headspace at the end.. even though we were turning into robots! All in all, this was one of the best pairing experiences I have had. Thanks for being a great teammate!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  From Erin Bassity:

  (Little Shop feedback) Thank you for your contributions to this project! I really appreciate you showing up and tackling the things you implemented and bringing an air of positivity to the group experience overall. Again, your strong communication skills were noticed and appreciated. Thank you for being a great team member!

  From Stephanie Bentley:

  Team:  You guys rocked! I had a lot of fun working on this project and building our site.  I’m really proud of our hard work and that we were able to accomplish all of the goals we set in our DTR.  It was such a nice feeling to be working on nothing but extensions the last few days of the project- definitely a refreshing change from previous project experiences! I think our success was the result of the really strong communication.  We were all on the same page for daily goals and overall work-structure. The Trello cards were great and much cleaner/easier than waffle.io. I’m glad we made this switch early in the project. I also think we worked really well as a team. We shared responsibility well and accomplished quite a bit individually, in pairs, and all together. I’m also really proud of our TDD-ing. This was something we all mentioned wanting to improve upon in the DTR, and I feel like we stuck to that goal and pushed ourselves to write tests before ever writing code.  I definitely feel stronger as a result. Thanks for a great end-of-mod project.

  Natalie:  It was great to get to work with you on this project. I appreciated the way you tackled authorization, and I think your dedication to TDD really helped set the tone for the group. I also really appreciated your dedicated, but easygoing  attitude.  I am the kind of person who gets anxious easily and your calm personality definitely helped chill me out. Thanks!

  From Mark Stover:

  Great working with you too Natalie! here is my feedback for little shop:
  It was great getting to work with you on another project. I really like the way you work through problems and appreciate the way you are able to calmly work through each error in order to arrive at a solution. I feel we used TDD really well on this project and think that is in large part because of the way you pushed for it in our DTR. It has taught me the true value of TDD and is something that I will take with me to future projects. Your open communication around study time was very helpful in prioritizing our time spent as a group and consequently, we made an awesome app together. Also, the levity you and your robot voice bring to the group is nothing short of wonderful. It was a pleasure working with you on Tripvontrapp!


## D: Professional Skills

https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/pull/115/commits/75de546b622f9de20f64433581168476501cdd7a

#### **Professional Development Workshops**

#### **Gear Ups**

 [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
 I have thought about and discussed many of the issues introduced in this session because as a minority woman, I have both witnessed and experienced marginalization. This session felt really heavy because it is a sensitive topic and some people can relate to many instances of marginalization and others have never experienced an instance of marginalization. There was actually someone in my group that said they have never experienced any of the examples of marginalization we discussed. My take away from this session is that we need to be sensitive to other peoples experiences even when they are different from our own. We also need to be honest about situations and stand up and say something when something is wrong.

 [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
 This session really made me think about my experience at Turing. I never really thought about grit as both passion and perseverance. I realized that many of the things I have accomplished in my life were a result of perseverance but the passion wasn't really there. I want to pursue my future goals with passion.

 [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
 This session was interesting considering the current political climate. There is a lot of change and some people don't adapt well to change. Automation is happening and society needs to adapt to the changes that are occurring in the world. One way to combat the negative effects of automation is revamp our education system to retrain people who's jobs are lost from automation. Also to better prepare people for adult life and entering the workforce.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  For Mark Stover:

  Mark, it was a pleasure working with you on Bike Share. I appreciated your commitment to learning and understanding. Our approach to completing iteration 1 together really helped my understanding of ActiveRecord fundamentals. Although we ultimately used the gem, I was impressed with your dedication to understanding pagination. Your positive attitude helped get us through the project and I’m proud of our completed project.

  For Erin Bassity:

  Erin, it was great working with you on Bike Share. The work you did made our site really amazing.  I appreciated you taking on the styling of the site and was really impressed with your work. I appreciated your familiarity with waffle and when it wasn’t working for us, you found an alternative tool. I really enjoyed the positivity you brought to our team. You commitment to learning and understanding was really helpful in reinforcing my learning.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  For Erin Bassity:

  Erin, I enjoyed implementing your travel experience idea for our little shop project. You did a great job managing the project. You were very organized and I think that kept us on track.  I really enjoyed the group pairing this time around. I think adding a fourth person to our group made us a stronger team and gave us more opportunities to pair. I appreciate all of the tutorials and helpful resources you found and shared with the group. Thank you for all of your hard work.

  For Stephanie Bentley:

  Stephanie, it was really great working with you on little shop. You are very dedicated and knowledgable. I appreciate your willingness to seek help when you have a question. You really want to understand why something works and when you ask questions it helps me understanding as well. You have strong communication skills and I appreciate the way you talk through what we're doing or trying to do while we're pairing. I love how you share information. Thanks for being a great teammate!

  For Mark Stover:

  Mark, it was a pleasure working with you on Little Shop. You did a great job implementing the cart functionality. I was really impressed. I really appreciated the pairing we did throughout the project. Working with you has been a great experience. You are very knowledgeable and dedicated to really understanding what's going on. I've learned so much from working with you on both Bike Share and Little Shop. Thanks for being a great teammate!

#### **Posse**
  I was in the Turing Lab Posse. We worked on an arcade cabinet and preparing a hardware hack-a-thon. I really enjoy working with hardware and it was fun to interact with other students that share that interest. Participation in this posse helped me identify some of the things I am interested in pursuing in my career after Turing.

#### **Playing a Part**

  I co-hosted the Imposters Group with Erin Bassity. This was a great opportunity to get to know other students outside of my mod and provide an outlet for people who are struggling with impostor syndrome. Our main focus was providing a safe place for people to vent their feelings and get advice from other students. We also wanted to build confidence and we tried to implement that by doing battle decks. Battle decks are five minute lightning talks that involve the group selecting a random topic and the presenter incorporating that topic into a set of slides that they have never seen before. It was a lot of fun and gave people practice presenting.
