# Victoria Vasys - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to: become proficient at Ruby (writing succinct & conventional code), become comfortable with creating singularly-responsible classes and methods, and be able to keep up with rest of class content while attempting to stay healthy & participate in interesting extracurriculars.

## Self-Assessment Scores

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 4 |
| B | **Individual Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Community** | 4 |

#### Notes

* I'm happy with my overall progress and feel pretty confident in my abilities thus far, but I gave myself a sub-par grade for individual projects because I tanked a few things in Complete Me. I made more specific notes about the project below the "Individual Projects" section. Hopefully my other work combined demonstrates that I'm ready to move on to Mod 2, but I look forward to a discussion about whether that's appropriate and in either case, what I can do to continue to improve.

* Complete Me (assessed by Beth)
  * I was almost there, but attempted to do something a little too complex for where I was considering the time allotted. I also worked and reworked a lot of code based on various pairings & got confused with which path was the best for my understanding, which consumed a lot of time and mental resources. 
* HTTP (assessed by Ilana)
  * Talked about how to make faraday response more dynamic and able to use
  * Talked about creating a response code module

### Pair Feedback

* Night Writer (Sergey Lukyanenko)
  >You were a great asset to the team. You are very professional and focused on your work. Despite the difficult deadlines for the Night Writer Project, you maintained a positive attitude. You responded to problems without getting frustrated. You often stayed late working and were very conscientious of timelines and resources. When fixing a problem, you readily explained how you were fixing it. One thing to possibly improve in your skills is dividing responsibilities of the project parts with your team, allowing your partner to be more involved in coding of the project. It has been wonderful working with you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.

  
* Black Thursday (Colleen Ward)
   >I really enjoyed working with you on Black Thursday, Victoria. I think we worked well together and created an excellent project. You have strong skills in fundamental ruby style, modules, and git workflow. You have a clear passion for programming and learning as much as you can, and I learned so much from working with you. I appreciate your willingness and capability to clearly explain things when I did not quite understand some concepts, especially incorporating modules and git workflow. Your ability to stay level headed when we hit a wall and we were both really frustrated is really admirable. Our work style is similar: jumping into a pry session if something wasn’t working or trying to write a method even if it wasn’t the most succinct, which I think contributed to our great partnership and some good laughs! Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of the work we did together.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
I thought it was really valuable speaking with other students (especially front-enders) about their current feelings and how they've experienced Turing so far. I think the most important things we discussed that will help to inspire a growth mindset are: not being afraid to ask questions, taking time to teach things we've learned, and fostering a culture of empathy & collaboration. I think it'll be really helpful to have a simple concept to keep in mind to provide comfort when feeling overwhelmed or stuck and to keep me on track and challenge myself IF I'm ever feeling comfortable :)

#### Session 2 - Getting Better at Difficult Things
I thought that the idea of cognitive resource management was the most interesting thing about the Gear Up. Knowing that there are tons of things in my "A" column that I can't do but need to is both daunting and exciting, but it's also reassuring that those things don't really burn my cognitive resources. I know that things are going to start accumulating in my "B" column, so it's useful to have strategies to keep it from clogging up (skip to "C" by learning from experts, break down bigger objectives into smaller skills-learning & practice a high quantity of high quality examples). It's also nice to realize that I have a few life skills on "C" that I can and will use in my life as a programmer. I will definitely try to keep this catalogue of my skills in mind & make sure to do what I can to keep things from piling on "B" & to check-in with & enhance the things on "A." The article was also useful in reminding me that I need to celebrate the small victories; attitude is important and losing hope only feeds the fatigue (adds to cognitive leaks that affect both processing & willpower). Plugging up those cognitive leaks whenever possible will help to build focus & learning. 

#### Session 3 - Managing Stress
The most helpful parts of this session were: the chance to reflect on & reinforce our growth mindsets, fueling new ideas for dealing with stress & the opportunity to make an action plan for how to limit stress. I didn't really understand the graph of avoidance versus withdrawal & I'm still unclear why those are opposites, but the concept of "off-ramps" is helpful to keep in mind. It would have been nice to share how we handled the past stressful situation we reflected on, but that was kind of swallowed up by off-ramp ideation. I enjoyed seeing other people's ideas through the poster-sharing; although there were a lot of the ideas that I have seen & tried before, there were a few good ideas that I don't usually go to in stressful situations (and one completely foreign one, RPDR, which made me chuckle when I later found out was Rupaul's Drag Race) & I realized I really need to break my own ice with comedy when I get really stress. I'm definitely better at actively incorporating things if I make a schedule for myself, so I made an action plan to manage daily stress by: stretching every day, singing in my car at least one way to or from the park-n-ride every weekday, exercising on Mondays, Thursdays & Saturdays, and taking a bath on Tuesdays. I will also continue to listen to funny & educational podcasts in my car, spend at least a couple meals a week with my boyfriend, and go hiking when I have enough time. And I need to work on making a good playlist of hilarious YouTube videos that I can go to when stress is really high. 

#### Session 4 - Personal Stories & Connection
I think our similarities are already really pushing us to collaborate & bolster each other. We are all driven to do really well and eventually attain high-fulfillment jobs! And our values all align with Turing's in some way or we wouldn't be here; that makes getting along pretty smooth & makes it easy to identify & deal with conflicts. As a large group, we discussed the importance of identifying and leveraging our differences, which will augment diverse collaboration & diminish the potential for things to bubble in times of conflict. We also identified additional similarities, especially in our strengths, among our cohort-mates, including self-reliance, fairness, some awareness of our privileges, empathy, inherent trust of abilities and a cooperative culture. Some differences that people found were styles of learning, introverted v. extroverted, collectivist v. individualist, and level of competitiveness. I think as we explore our differences more & more, we'll be able to use them to our advantage in developing diverse teams & we'll be able to tackle future projects in a deliberate & organized way based on our individual strengths and weaknesses.

#### Session 5 - Debugging the Gender Gap
I definitely learned more details about some of my role models & identified some new ones through the film. It also reinforced the extreme importance of inclusion and respect for and celebration of all of our differences. It was pretty shocking to hear about some of the more modern issues involving lack of equality in the world of programming & that makes me fairly nervous about entering the field, but the discussions we had afterward, the interactions I often see at Turing, and the encouragement & empowerment I've witnessed through the Joan Clarke Society are very reassuring and I really feel as though I'll have solid support for whatever challenges I face in the future. Another big thing I took away from the discussions was awareness of potential exclusion of people who don't fit into the diversity groups at Turing. I think it would be highly beneficial for each of these groups to have opportunities for allies to participate & contribute. I think in general, the culture at Turing truly embraces diversity and fosters open discussion, but we need to continually be aware of any instances where someone or a group of people is isolated or stereotyped and stand up/speak up when we don't feel comfortable with the conversation or actions.

### Community Participation
This mod, I've mostly contributed to the community by showing up; I've tried to contribute a positive attitude, useful questions, and personal insight to various meetings, events, school groups, and in class. I've attended Joan Clarke Society panels and discussions, speakers and spikes every Friday, the Demo Competition night, productivity lunches, Pahlka Posse lunches, the jobs-working-hour-Monday-mornings, the Denver RB meetup, Turing Game Time lunches. I've also participated in lunch roulettes and a Go Code Colorado brainstorming session. I've also hopefully served as a willing and responsive mentee to my mod-2 pairers and my personal & professional mentors. I've also tried to help others within my cohort when I'm able, but still being pretty new to everything, I haven't had the opportunity to truly add much to the greater Turing community in the way of programming. I aim to further my contributions next mod by starting a blog- both to give family & friends a better feel for Turing, and to reflect on more technical stuff, by contributing my skills to a Go Code team and by volunteering at Turing-hosted events like Try Turing & kids/girls who code.
