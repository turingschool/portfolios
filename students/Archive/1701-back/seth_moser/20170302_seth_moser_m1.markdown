#### Notes

*  Showed comprehension of more advanced concepts, such as message sending, and private interfaces.
*  Good structure overall, with opportunities to reduce duplicity.
*  Overall a good effort, would like to see a more professional delivery of his work.
*  http (too many instance variables, dictionary could be its own method)

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Knight Writer: Josh Thompson: "Seth. It was great fun to work with you on Night Writer. You were extremely helpful and patient working through TDD and refactoring with me, despite my late-in-the-game restart. Your easy-going disposition served us both well, and your comfort with Ruby methods was obvious. With a tiny adjustment to hashes instead of case statements, I think you’re on top of everything that’s been passed our way so far."

*   Black Thursday: Craig Ness: "Seth, nice job on our final project of Mod 1! I was extremely impressed by your technical abilities and your speed of solving problems. You always seemed to have an idea of what direction you wanted to take, which it made it seem like we were never truly halted in our progress. Your approach to progamming avoids the pitfall of “analysis paralysis” because you are rarely hesitant to try something in your code, and I appreciated seeing this working style because it is unlike my own. Sometimes, however, this approach meant that you did a lot of your thinking in your text editor instead of taking the time to communicate your thoughts out loud. This sometimes left me wondering what you were attempting to do, and how I could contribute, so in this way, I think our communication lacked somewhat. I realized that in order to make my own contributions, I sometimes needed to work on my own at my own (admittedly slower) pace so that I could have time to work through what was happening conceptually in the project. Aside from that, and perhaps having a better git workflow, I thought we were able to work through this project without any major roadblocks. Finally, I thought your refactoring skills were also impressive, as you were able to shrink down a lot of methods using more advanced enumerables. Nice job once again, and good luck in Mod 2!"

## E: Community

### Gear Ups

#### Growth Mindset
Don't hold yourself back by focusing on the grades or how bad you do. Keep an open mind and continue to learn. Mistakes are a good thing and failure is how we learn.

#### Getting Better at Difficult things
Don't bunch everything up in catagory **B** move one at a time from **A** to **B** to **C**. Master one thing at a time, get a handle on it before moving onto something new.

#### Stress Management
Find ways to deal with stress, something you're comfortable with that's not self destructive. Watch a movie, take a walk, meet with friends. Don't immediately turn to alcohol/other unhealthy options.

#### Personal Stories and Connections
* What brough you here? My sister, she new I was into coding and suggested it.
* What lenses do you view the world with? Optimism
* What values drive you? Respect, Morality
* How do you demonstrate? I treat others the way I want to be treated
* Could others guess your values based on your demonstration? No because guessing somebody's values is an almost impossible task

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
Even now there's still a lot of discrimination in the workplace. I may not see it because I don't personally have to deal with it, but keep an eye out, learn the signals and querks people do that show discrimination and take a stand against it. Don't let it to continue because doing nothing is the same and being the one discriminating.

### Community Participation
I've been very active on slack offering help to others, helping others with code problems and sending out drills that are relavent to our current projects/assignments. There when people need help.

## Final Review

*   Really strong work, especially toward the end of the module
*   Continue to support your peers
