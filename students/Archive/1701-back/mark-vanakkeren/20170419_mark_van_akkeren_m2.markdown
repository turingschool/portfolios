# Mark Van Akkeren - M2 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis
Really looking forward to actually building out a functional application and no longer playing only in the terminal.  Having something to look at will be nice.  I have a familiarity with HTML/CSS/JS that might help in this mod.  So far (week 2) I'm liking the flow of CRUD.  We'll have to see what RAILS brings.

## Self-Assessment   

| Category | Score (optional) |  
| --- | ----- |
| **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| **Group Projects** | 4 |
| **Professional Development** | 4 |
| **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

Takeaways, your experience: I got a little over confident with the ease of how the first few weeks went.  This bit me in the ass hard come week 5/6.  Baseline understandings of the work we are doing is there but I really want to know all of it better.  I'm comfortable with it at a high level just need to really expose myself to more granular interconnectivity with all of the RAILS functions.

-----------------------
## A: End-of-Module Assessment
| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | ---- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | 3.67 (4-4s 2-3s) |
| **Written Diagnostic** | 4.5/5 |
Takeaways, your experience: Had to retake final.  I was a mess on the first round, just completely out of it.  Second time thru felt way better.  Also felt comfy on the written tho I think i blanked on a few things but also felt it all familiar.
## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
https://gist.github.com/markyv18/179d31eb2baaa87c8d088ddf16ed5d7a

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
 Takeaways, your experience: Repetition but more.  Frustrated that i never completed one. Something i'll be doing over the break is taking another hit at this.  Shore up my global understanding of AR and RAILS.
#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
Takeaways, your experience: RMP was a wash, had a great white board collaboration with Sergey and we started pushing up code.  Woke up saturday morning to a mouse shit everywhere, pull back some boards, move some appliances, infestation nation... spent the weekend nuking mice.  Job tracker went same as blogger and mix master... 70% is great for a baseline but not acceptable to me.
## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**
Description: In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

Takeaways, your experience: I frikin LOVED this and Sinatra and CRUD.  Simple spatial and process controlled builds and this just fell into place right in front of me.  Team work was great too, really enjoyed the paired-pairing approach we took with additional solo work in the pairs.  Played right into my belief of give members ownership but also support to make it all gel well.  

**Little Shop of Orders**
Description: In this project you’ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

Takeaways, your experience: Damn.  Teaming up with two RAILS masters was intimidating.  However i got to drive for the first 5 days and the fact that what i'd think was nearly always in line with what the navigators were saying kept me feeling as tho i wasn't a complete anchor or unsure of the material.  Best friends wedding over the weekend put me in a bind.  Skip and deeply regret it or know that even in real world, missing team members for life things is something we deal with.  First thing i put up in the DTR and was clear that there was little flexibility with it.  This hurt me big time but i'm not going to regret watching best friends get married.  Came back and i was behind, got assigned some side project added on functionality that allowed me to tinker and integrate my know how into the lot of it all.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share
<br /> <br />
  From Sam: I’m glad we got to work together on this project. It was a valuable experience to build a project together like we did, and I’m proud of the result. Thank you for your part in that. It also was a cool experience staying up until well past midnight on Wednesday night with you. It felt good to be finishing it together when all the sane people had gone to sleep. In our evaluation with Beth, you actually identified the area I’d like to give some constructive feedback on. She asked you to describe your least favorite part of the project, and you said you were going to respond like a politician and not answer that question directly. This was a pattern I noticed a few times during our collaboration, and I think it might be counterproductive in some situations. So, my suggestion is to practice active listening and respond to the question that actually was asked. That being said, it was a valuable experience for me to work with someone with a different work style from my own, so thank you for that.
  <br /><br />
  From Chris: Mark, I always love the approach you have when it comes to projects and challenges.  You have this grin like you are about to take on a mountain and destroy it.  It brings confidence and positivity which is always needed and should never be lacking.  I always enjoy working with you, as you seem to ask the same questions I’m thinking.  I know I always have a friend when you are around.
  <br /><br />
  From Beth: Mark is incredibly fun to work with. I really enjoyed talking through problems with him. We’re both pretty extroverted so we got along really well. We probably need someone to keep us focused because we got off track quite a bit. He’s a great collaborator and he knows his CRUD.

  From Nick: Mark I appreciated your positive attitude and humorous demeanor throughout the project. You were always able to keep the mood light while we were working together. You were receptive to feedback and willing to step out of your comfort zone to try new things. You displayed great organizational skills by keeping our waffle board up-to-date and taking notes during our feedback sessions. Your were very open about your skillset and where you felt you need improvement. I wish we had a chance to pair one on one this project to address some of the areas that you felt you needed improvement.  Overall I am really happy with what we accomplished as a group and want to thank you for contributing to the projects overall success.
  <br /><br />
  From Riley: Mark brings a positive attitude and a sense of humor which lightens the mood even in the most stressful setting. I enjoyed the passion you brought regarding  our project subject (scumbags), hearing you rant was hilarious. I also appreciate the fact that Mark knows what he’s strong/weak at and attempts to reach out for help to improve on the things he may not be as experienced in. I regret as a partner, that I did not take more time to work through things with him. Overall, Mark was a great partner to have.

#### **Gear Ups**
<br /><br />
 [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
Our circle of people that chatted this one over there was a wide variety of backgrounds. I ooze privilege but what I've tried to do with it is have it empower me to be a force for good.  Two of my top skills are fairness and observation.  Being able to see situations and call out bull shit, or to inject temperance into a heated discussion.  The empathy comes from simply taking a moment to watch and learn the context of the other person's situation.   
<br /><br />
[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
Ack, still conflicted on this one.  Jotted stuff down in the note book then went back and looked what I wrote the first time we did this same gear up (december'16).  Pretty funny, pretty much word for word the same.  I think it's my general disgust with americans' love of needing to market or label something (usually in order to sell it).  Conversely, I understand from the scientific POV/pursuit the need to isolate the concept in order to further investigate.  There's heaps of nuance in these things but i still can't help but just think it's brute force.  I dont like it, i hate the process i'm just really fucking determined to beat the shit out of this intellectual adversary that i'm up against.  <-- doesnt seem to nicely fit into any of these grit/growth mindset.
<br /><br />
[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
 Oh man, fav topic time.  Automation BEGS for us to talk about Universal Basic Income.  With continuing levels of automation in all aspects of human life it is CLEAR that the economy of the future does not require as many humans to be involved for it to be as streamlined as possible.  Ironically Turing, in trying to elevate individuals, could potentially be contributing to the problem but giving skills to promote further automation.  There are all kinds of difficult questions to ask, what an ideal citizenry does? That people might want to work but there's no work for them to do.  It's a huge black hole but the bottom line (currently) for me, from a political perspecitve, is, you can't advocate for policies that strip society of jobs and then tell those that lost jobs to try harder, for every bit of policy that promotes automation you _have to_ ALSO support policies supporting those that lose that job.  Right now GOP and 3rd way dems are basically caring fuck all about that.  *mad face*

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
#### **Giving Feedback**
##### Feedback from me for Bike Share
<br /><br />
  For Beth: I enjoyed the balance. We got shit done, and had fun doing it.  Easy to do when we are both feeling good with the material.  Nice balance of random rabbit holes of humour followed by pushing good code.  *hat tip*
  <br /><br />
  For Sam: in retrospective you did a fantastic job at the PM organization.  While i bristled with what seemed like over kill at times it was good to always be on the same page and always have good communication lines open.  I have taken a lot away from that and totally will be applying elements in future groups.
<br /><br />
For Chris:  C-dale brings both positivity and a grounded attitude to the team. At times you and I can be the weaker members of the team with regard to the code base but can still add value thru speaking up on approach and insight to the use cases.  It’s really hard to fight and stand up for your inclusion and learning potential in these projects when your teammates are strong but we can’t depend on them to give us work or to naturally take into account things we might need to feel we’ve played a role.  Be empowered to step in and ask/take/discuss what piece of the pie you can take and complete.   More often than not when the subject is breached people are willing to work with us in this area.  Keep your head up and keep pushing :)

  For Riley:  To say i was intimidated to work with you guys would be an understatement. I knew I was in over my head from the get go.  I appreciate you allowing me to drive for a lot of the first week. It helped reinforce a lot of my understandings at that point.  I'm not sure _where_ we could have put it in this project (what with the successive, seemingly sequential, user stories) but a group work technique that I've found to help when teams are made up of varying levels of talent is to give some ownership of a small feature to the weaker member and let them run with it.  Funny to be on the other side of that advice now!  Finally, making the point to ask me about coming back to the learning points that I'd put out there for myself in the DTR, was generous as well as your patience in going over it.
 <br /><br />
 For Nick: I grossly underestimated where you were at with the material when we kicked this off. Didn't take long to figure out my mistake.  Looking at your mini project alone blew me away.  I appreciate both of you having the patience to let me drive the first week and to solidify my understanding of the more rudimentary concepts and connections within RAILS. I'm not sure _where_ we could have put it in this project (what with the successive, seemingly sequential, user stories) but a group work technique that I've found to help when teams are made up of varying levels of talent is to give some ownership of a small feature to the weaker member and let them run with it. Funny to be on the other side of that advice now! You're very well poised to make a mark at whatever place you end up.
  p.s. sleep more.

### Playing a Part
In the spirit of the soup nazi you can call me the coffee nazi (geez we need to come up with something a bit more socially acceptable to call that these days... fucking nazis).  Making coffee was a multiple times a day occurrence UNTIL!!!! I put out a terry tate: office linebacker sign... amazingly the coffee seems to be making itself now. Who knew?  I also lead a friday spike on CRUD methods that had 4 people attend (("small !woot!")).  Paired a few times with mod 1ers and also did drop in "help me" code assists on some mod 1 projects.  Also, if "playing a part" also has social implications than i finally got out for an evening of hanging out with the mod.  First time in 3 mods i've been able to do that.  Heaps of fun!
