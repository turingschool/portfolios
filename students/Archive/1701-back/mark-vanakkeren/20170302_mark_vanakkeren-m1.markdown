## Areas of Emphasis

Okie dokie... on to round two.  Writing this at the end of week two.  Different approach this go around.  That pie chart of time... instead of 90/10 it was 50/40/10 with 50% being panic.  This time it's 90/10 and doing good work.  I have the bandwidth to do the drills and exercises and don't get overly sucked in on the projects and HWs.  The independent learning has gone well and it's given me the tools to attack the problems that raise their heads in the projects.  I feel capable this time of taking on the challenges the school delivers.  The positivity is cyclical, though I keep wondering when i'll turn a corner and be overwhelmed again and fight to prepare for it and push back the stupidity demons.

Beginning of week 4 here.  Still so far so good, though this HTTP project has me flailing a bit but flailing with more tools.  Feel very well prepared for the mid mod today as well having run thru the demos related to it twice, just need to remember to talk and discuss with instructor what I'm doing and any help i can get.     

I arrived here looking at gaining a skill to then leverage along with my other skills I've acquired in my various and multifaceted careers.  That someone with such a diverse career background with also a developer skill set would be a valuable asset in the work force -- the premise I'm rolling with!  I had attended the July Try Turing class which was the convincing factor for attending (and friends saying "you'd be good at this" <-- i feel like i'm doubting them now ;), but i was "scared" of javascript and signed up for a night class at Galvanize.  It helped with warming me up a bit to coding and getting more comfortable with JS. The thing I've been repeating since day one has been "just get the skillset, just get the skillset" <-- in "just keep swimming" Dory voice.

#### Notes

Credit Check:
More methods

MVA Note: spent 15min building this one not knowing it was the graded assement and instead poured my time into getting the merge sort (of the sorting suite assignement) to work.

Date Night:
Good variable and method naming.
Very expressive and clear code.
Really good testing at unit and integration level.
Some opportunities to take risks with the syntax (i.e. making more concise code)

MVA Note: Really got to shine on this one. First time I felt like I had the tools I needed to get after a project and was totally equipped to solve the problems presented. Also, had new epiphanies with regard to building out test suites.

HTTP:
Hello counts by two.
Word Search does not work.
look out for using instance variables when you dont need to
think about how methods can pass each other methods rather than how they can all change the value of an instance variable.

MVA Note: Awful time with this one. Really struggled with the concept and in setting up postman and faraday.  Consulted with 4 different folks about the flow of it as well as attempting to grasp the concept.  Never really got it down.  If anything, getting stuff to run was a testament to knowing the how but not the why.  It annoys the hell out of me but I was able to produce _something_ even if it was poor.  I was determined to NOT let this break my stride and spirit about how things had been going.  Proof of that has been my success and confidence on the last project and the various evals and diagnostics since HTTP.

#### Notes
Night Writer: Very clean, refactored project
Would like to see file io split into separate class and runners separated from classes
Incorporated numbers, full functionality plus 1 extension

MVA Note: Split the project in half. Danny allowed me to work thru and finish my test suite and code base and that all requirements would work before helping me with refactoring into a much more concise block of work.  While I don't believe i would have rocked straight 4s on my own, 3s (3+s?) were totally there and in working with Danny got to see how, in the future, I can further break down my methods into singular logic chunks.

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://gist.github.com/markyv18/efc317f2c21e95209d00bdc5d0e52ff5) to DTR Memo from paired project with Danny Radden.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 - Night Writer - (Danny Radden):

To Danny:

This went pretty smooth.  It would be interesting to work together again on a harder project, maybe at that point some difficulties or struggles might get sussed out but when the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I was massively impressed with your familiarity in calling concise methods point by point when modifying data.  I'll take a lot away from that.  When you wanted to refactor my code you took the time to walk me thru it and help me with a better understanding of the process.  There ain't no shit here... because we finished so quickly, and refactored quickly you then were taking the time to help others out.  Only positive vibes.        

From Danny:

You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility and enthusiasm with working on the project. You had a good grasp on what we had to do and what the assessors were expecting from us. I think we both should have done a better job with TDD. We should have done more TDD from the beginning. Also, you made David Hasselhoff too skinny. You need to work on you ASCII conversion skills. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well.



*   Project 2 - Black Thursday - (Jack Pincus):

To Jack:

Really enjoyed working on this project with you.  While we started slowly given our weekend activities, once back at school we got after it in a very methodical way.  I'm astounded by your knack for ORMs and the mental mapping to follow every object so easily.  I get it with time but takes some processing you seem to get it instantly.  No real work flow issues and I believe it would require working on a harder project to tease out any differences in work style/collaboration. As long as the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I appreciated the breaking up of ownership of code when the spec allowed for it and driver/navigation switching.         

From Jack:  Stop and read the error message closely. It is really tempting to jump ahead and fix what you think might be the problem, but often this is not the problem.
Time manangement: We are both guilty on this front. It would have been a lot less stressful if we had managed our time a little better. It worked out in the end, but I think my takeaway for this is that its better to frontload the work.
Working in a team. We were able to really effectively divide and conquer on this project. It was really nice working with you, since you always stayed positive, got the work done, and knew what it was that needed doing.
Shortcuts. I can't believe how well you can navigate around any computer. I really need to practice after seeing how you work on your, and my computer.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
Listening to Sonia talk was the most resonate for me.  Someone coming from an established background that wants to try something new.  Easy in concept but harder in practice to teach an old dog new tricks.  Over the course of the mod I have realized that while I have a feeling that I have not failed anything it is because when I realize i'm not good at something I bow out rather quickly so as to never face real struggle.  With my commitment to this school i'm facing failure and true perseverance for the first time in a long time.  Casey put it well in one group meeting that there are two aspects to this, grit is the act of pushing forward whereas growth is the acceptance of the struggle that is the process.  Slowly am i accepting this erosion of my ego, but it's a rough ride.

Coming around this second time the comparisons are apples to oranges.  I'm not sure it's really fair to try and rationalize it.  I'm still not sure I follow a growth mindset but more of a brute force grit mindset. The one time I faced adversity (HTTP) this mod I really fought the process. I was resigned to it (which perhaps is growth), but was still irritated about not "getting the thing". This remains a work in progress.  


#### Session 2 - How to deal with difficult things better

Divided on this one.  I'm so rooted in doing something well and the consequences of judging myself when it's not done well.  Ties in with my difficulty with growth mindset vs brute force vs grit.

#### Session 3 - Stress
Far easier this pass than last, does that mean i've got the tools to work on problems?  Still guarded about what comes around the next corner.  Still need to develop better coping strategies.  Shit is HARD.  I dont like not knowing.  If I at least have something to go off of i'm okay but just treading water and lost... that's a battle that still being fought.

#### Session 4 - Self Reflection
Bullet points from discussion notes
* MPAED - making people awesome every day (what I did/do with coaching, what i'll do with coding from an interpersonal point of view)
* If you're an ass hole i'll let you know that you're an ass hole
* stand up for those that can't
* core value = fairness (an arbitrator or devil's advocate)
* objectivity - plays into fairness and arbitration by allowing me to see clearly both sides of the fence
* able to describe/convey succinctly and richly why each side might have a point and how to resolve
* lens on the world - critical thinking (if it's illogical/BS/unfair/unhelpful i'll point it out AND explain why it's unfair,etc)


#### Session 5 - Breaking the Gender Barrier
Great 80 minutes of blood pressure raising annoyance. I'm dumbfounded-astounded that such bigoted beliefs and norms can be so prominent in tech today (hell, anywhere). Texting with Sonia this morning the exclamation "Really? It's 2017!" came to mind on far too many topics that tie in to this. Making under represented folks feel welcome is important to me and should I come across oppressors of their rise when once out in the work force there will be some punching (possibly literal ones if needed) of said bigots. An UBER dev environment is unconscionable.

### Community Participation
Whereas in the last mod I worked to help others' emotional states this time, with the larger tool kit, I've gone about trying to help others with setting up their computers to jive with the work being done here, to set up work flow processes, to tutor and help others with drills, exercises and creatures.  Help classmates get comfortable with the work that we are doing both subjectively (mental approach to it) and objectively.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Enigma was my only group project and it really lit a fire under my ass and motivated me.  I suck at "getting stared" (see comment on blank screen syndrome at the top) but with a partner I can't afford to allow that to affect me.  Cody jumped on it and passed over an outline almost ASAP, that was the catalyst and boom we were off and running.  We put in some long hours but our collaboration and DTR-ing was SOLID.  It was very enjoyable to work with someone and while we fell just shy of doing a full complete of the project it was a huge leap in progress from the previous work that was very incomplete. It was also FUN.

#### Enigma

Notes:
had zero tests
had one method that did everything
talked about refactoring and running the file properly
they are going to write tests and try to make the file work correctly by monday

MVA Note: we built out some rudimentary tests by Monday.  Understanding of TDD has come a long way since then.  

Overall Functionality : 2

Fundamental Ruby & Style : 2

Test-Driven Development : 1

Breaking Logic into Components : 1

MVA Note: I find it funny that the scores are so poor here but my reflection on the effort and result is so positive.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
Listening to Sonia talk was the most resonate for me.  Someone coming from an established background that wants to try something new.  Easy in concept but harder in practice to teach an old dog new tricks.  Over the course of the mod I have realized that while I have a feeling that I have not failed anything it is because when I realize i'm not good at something I bow out rather quickly so as to never face real struggle.  With my committment to this school i'm facing failure and true perseverance for the first time in a long time.  Casey put it well in one group meeting that there are two aspects to this, grit is the act of pushing forward whereas growth is the acceptance of the struggle that is the process.  Slowly am i accepting this erosion of my ego, but it's a rough ride.

#### Cohort Norms
Intro vs Extro vs Ambivert - This was helpful, i've alwasy struggled when these talks come up because I can so violently oscillate between one or the other and in short spans of time too.  It was enjoyable to sit with a group that felt similar.  At times we are one, at times we are another.  Using the strneghts of both sides to advance certain areas of our work.  Also learning how threatening one way can be to the other, but then leveraging our understaning of both to further the efforts of a group task.  Growth: when feeling growth = extrover, when feeling fixed = introvert.

### Personal Stories & Connection
Ilana, Ken, Charlotte - While there was little that Ken or I found in direct common with the others that does not mean that we can't understand and work with the points of view expressed by others.  The conclusion was while there is great empathy, it is ACTING on that empathy that will advance things.  This has inspried me to lay the ground work for civic involvement in causes I support once I have more time to deveote to them.  

### Grit Mindset
It would seem i have very little lack of grit.  I _HATE_ being committed to something and not understanding it.  That drives me further in my effort to conquer the subject matter.  Grit seems to be the "physical" connotation of effort whereas growth is the "emotional" connotation of acceptance of the struggle.  I have great difficulty in accepting strugggle, it's not something i've ever really encounterd and its struggle is weighing down my effort to push forward.  I'm starting to "not care" about my emotional state and cast off my cares of "how i feel" in hopes of allowing me to push forward my objective learning.  "getting clinical" so to speak.  

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding One

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-van-akkeren
* https://resume.creddle.io/resume/2f01ty50fdc

While I understand the importance of this I had this work drilled into me during university and have almost 15 years experience of working with resumes and public representation of my person so feel very comfortable in this space.

### Learning to Pair

Driver - navigator nice in person making sure that who knows more is navigator and hopefully imparting that knowledge to the driver --- Ping pong helpful, I believe, for more evenly matched skill sets --- Screenhero really good for me cuz i'm super detailed oriented in describing where stuff is and describing what exactly is going on

### Feedback

This was good, helping me to learn HOW to frame the constructive portion of the feedback.  I've got a lot of intuition in this area with having coached people for 10+ years and figuring out how best to approach each person and make them feel very important while still providing something that improves them and drives them forward.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

1 - for Cody
You dove right into this so fast.  Right after the initial DTR you had code blocks/files set up and ideas down on paper.  Going forward I’d think more DTRs that aren’t centered around simply work styles and life styles, but also the project itself would really help us with setting deliverable check points and advancing the whole of the project.  Specifics… this is hard… at this point it would seem the material we are facing is far more the inhibitor to our progress than any way that you or I work.  It’s tough to make specific recommendations to your work style when all the barriers that might force them are because of our grasp of the content (this comment applies to me too).  If anything be open about the content you/we don’t know.  Again that circles back to just knowing the material in the first place.  Relative to what I heard from other groups, on the personal level, we were amiable to each other, both had buy in on the effort and did our best to get the core of the project finished.

2 - for Dan
Dan was a rock for me. We'd gone thru Try Turing together and so had a connection early on.  He's been incredibly giving and volunteered both his time to help me understand the material in class as well as allowed me to vent my frustrations. His patience in times of immense struggle and the guidance that he was able to impart left me better able to tackle the work.  He's well poised to further his development going into Mod 2.  I'm super stoked for him and look to him (and others) as examples of perseverance in the face of repeated hardships that can eventually bring forth great success.  


3 - for Amara
This is easy, Amara is the reason I was able to keep my emotional head (barely) above the water in the first 4 weeks.  She made sure to check on me and take stock of my health. The things I was doing for others Amara was doing for me.  Taking care of the human element in this mix of chaos that I was attempting to adapt to.  Beyond the emotional component she guided me thru the maze of syllabus material helping me see/find things that I had no idea about.  Amara is the embodiment of compassion :)


### Being a Community Member

1 - from Cody
Mark, you epitomize hard work. One of my biggest concerns in collaborating with others is a lack of drive and the tendency to spit the bit when the going gets tough, but it was never an issue during our project. I couldn't match your tenacity but I aspired to emulate it by showing up early and staying late. You're an excellent problem solver -- I felt like a lot of the time you were doing all the work because you'd just start putting things together whenever we got stuck. You sped through setbacks with ease and were quick to present ideas for solutions to our problems. Your background in working with athletes proved beneficial as you kept a positive attitude and knew the right things to say at the right time like giving praise or words of encouragement when things got tough. With my lack of experience in collaborating with others I felt like I held you back at times and if you were given another partner capable of better collaboration I don't think you'd have trouble completing the project to spec. To further your growth I think you can work to get comfortable with Github so you and your collaborators can stay on the same page throughout a project and try to interpret the project spec literally so as to not miss any requisite details.

2 - from Dan
Mark was awesome to work with in this Mod. His ability to think about things on a higher level really helped elevate my understanding of things we talked about. He is contantly here every day pushing to be better. Sometimes he is a little to hard on himself becasue I feel he knows way more than he gives himself credit for. Im priveledged to call him my friend I i look forward to continually working with him in the future.

3 - from Charlotte
When I was feeling really defeated about Battleship you sat with me and Max and helped us put our dissapointment in perspective. It was so incredibly helpful for me to hear that, from an outsider's perspective, it seemed like I was doing well. The encouragement was invaluable, and helped me adjust my attitude. I felt so much better after that conversation. I know that you struggled a lot this mod and I think that your attitude will help you through the rest of your time here. Thanks for the support.

### Playing a Part

offered myself as an open and listening "friend" to those that want to talk thru things - i'm no psychologist but being a coach has trained me to be pretty close to one.  We talk thru things and i dont give answeres but I ask questions that help them solve what emotional elements they are stuck on.
observing different backgrounds and having that inspire me to push harder on social change

Outcome:
RETAINED
