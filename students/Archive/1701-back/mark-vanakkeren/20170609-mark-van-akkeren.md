## Areas of Emphasis

 APIs are the way development works these days, garnering a solid foundation on their production and consumption was top priority

If the group projects in Mod3 are the early indicators of working on a team in the real world than I greatly look forward to the fun and opportunities and challenges this vocation will bring. 

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

 **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
* Build out the consumption of an API
* Was rough but also set the foundation of understanding for what consumption is. Didn't do a great job but have built off of this experience to further my understanding and looking back have come a long way.


## B: Group Work & Projects

**[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)** 
* Build out the production of an API, build out relationships between tables, and perform SQL query business logic endpoints.
* Between struggling to get up and running on this and missing two days, I bombed, but... i can now look back at it and think of it as easy. So, pleased with the reflection of having come so far. While my formal background is in finance i've largely cast that off as anything i care for... that said there is a certain attraction to SQL queries that I can't help but feel is derived from my background in finance and accounting.  The desire to extract meaningful data from a seemingly jumbled pile of numbers and use that information to inform decision making. 

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
**[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/corkboard)** 
* To build out the macro functionality of a clone website mimicing Thumbtack.com
* Really enjoyed the deep brain storming and discovery that went into formulating the building blocks of this.  Figuring out how to build it right from the ground up before even dipping a toe in. 

**[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/josh-works/corkboard)** 
* Refinement and further build out of features of the same project
* Being the holdover from the previous sprint on this project i was tasked with getting the team up to speed on it and intervening/assisting when utter confusion broke out over why something was done the way it was done.  Hopped around and paired/assisted numerous teammates to help in getting various pieces built out.  Had a great time working with this team.  Hard work made easy with good teammates.  A nice blend of levity and focus.

## C. **Gear Ups**

[Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
 * out of town  

[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
 * For a white dude (i.e. never on the outside), I've chosen a lot of activities that have generally left me as a social outcast and I've now come to embrace and enjoy that black sheep status. So while no means is it a real representation of what POC or women must deal with it's exposure to being made fun of for being the very thing that you are or want to be has given me insight into the illogic bull shit that neglected groups have to put up with. Playing off my "oregon trail generation" status (not genX and not genY) I can channel the anger of X into being an agent of change to bring about the hope that Y's are so inspired by.  I dont want to work at a white sausage fest.  The prospect of that is gross. (so many parallels in this discussion to urban development). Also, it's 20 fucking 17... why are these still issues. <mad face>
 

[UBIv2](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)

* Ah, deliciously fav topic.  Wasn't really swayed by much of what was discussed.  I'm pretty much all for it.  I have concerns about monetary motivation for a lot of folks and how to alleviate that.  Also, I feel that for those that don't like it for whatever grounds, to challenge them with the question of "we continue to see decreasingly levels of work force employment participation as well as with each subsequent recovery from a recession since the 1980s there are always less jobs brough back than before (jobless recoveries), the economy of the future simply will not need as many humans to participate in it for it to be successful. Given that scenario what do you propose to do with all of the folks that are not needed?"


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* Blog: https://gist.github.com/markyv18/07451a56624f52e7c8a1c8df295c1ac3

#### **Posse**
  * Made a "hologram" with the lab bros. I enjoy hopping around to many different spikes, so much great material at all of them, want to be in 5 places at once. 
  * It's like wikipedia.  I always know i'm going to learn something new.  
  * How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional? -- Maybe with the algorithms, in looking forward to technical interviews?

#### **Playing a Part**

> How else you've contributed to the community
* I make coffee for the entire school on all too frequent the occasion because we don't have a Terry Tate "Office Linebacker" in the kitchen.  You kill the joe, you bettah make some mo'! 
* Checking in with various folks just to see how they are doing and to encourage them to keep their head up and keep fighting and learning.
