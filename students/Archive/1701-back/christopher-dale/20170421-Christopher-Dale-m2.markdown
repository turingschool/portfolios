# \<Christopher Dale> - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \<I started this module with hopes of being more comfortable with new content.  I also made it a goal to start networking and begin entering a looking for job frame of mind, so as to be comfortable when that time comes around.  Ending this module, I found that I am even more curious to dig into the things that I do know, as well as the things that I don't.  Some of the speakers this mod have given me more interest into making my own personal blogger and put myself out there.  This will help me get over "myself", in the sense that if I make myself vulnerable, I should hopefully be able to face the fears and anxiety that are still with me. >

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [\<RSpec & MiniTest](https://medium.com/@christopherdale_38364/the-two-testers-which-to-use-both-881ec5968d64)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> \<Both of these lessons were great in showing each of their perspective parts.  Blogger being able to take user generated stuff and being able to handle it and display it.  Mix Master being an introduction of how tags work and different classes talk to each other.  The importance of these two things are probably not realized until you see a bigger project like Little Shop.>

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> \<These projects helped me see what I still needed to learn and get better at to have a better working project.  They are slightly bigger and less hand holdy.  Which was good for me.  I'm looking forward to being able to have more confidence when trying to do these projects again.>


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share** 
>* \<Bike Share is an app that tracks data from the San Francisco public bike share they have their.  It was surreal to be able to work with some real data, it allowed for a better connection and understanding.  It was also a very large project, which my group tackeled with the agile approach.  It allowed us to become better communicators and easier for us to collaborate.  Highlighting the importance of how a team should act with one another.>

> **Little Shop of Orders** 
>* \<We did our Little Shop as a black markets goods website.  Selling unique and hard to find items across the galaxy.>
>* \<It was fun to be able to choose our own topic and be given different material to implement into the project.  Having the freedom to add our own little twists with what we made, allowed for the project to seem more desirable to work on.>

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From \<Sam Landfried>: 
It was nice to get to know you better while working on Bike Share. Also, I appreciated your work effort. It was easy to concentrate on the task at hand with you. I want to applaud the grit you displayed while tackling one of the later methods in the trips dashboard (I forget which one in particular). It was a challenge, but you kept grinding away at it. I think in those situations you’ll benefit yourself if you break the code down, piece by piece, and check every assumption you’re making about the code. What value does this method call return? Is this enumerator really doing what I think it is? This attention to detail might be tedious, but it will help you identify problems (and then solve them) quicker. You’re super easy to get along with, and I’m looking forward to continuing to work with you throughout the mod. Feel free to hit me up if you ever want another pair of eyes on your code.
  
  >* From \<Beth Knight>:  For Chris. Chris always showed up ready to work. He was always ready to drive when we were pair programming. I think he got quiet when things started moving fast, and so my only feedback would be to speak up more.
  
  >* From \<Mark VanAkeren>:

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From \<Josh Thompson>: Chris! I enjoyed getting to work with you on Little Shop. Thanks for your work, and for your patience with us all.
>
> I appreciated the calmness that you brought to the table, and your constant willingness to figure out what you needed to work on, and your care at managing all the branches and waffle cards well. It’s sometimes a bit hard on the team when one person just launches off in one direction without any input from others, so I appreciate how intentional you were with regards to that.
>
> We’re supposed to have recommendations in here, so I’d recommend figuring out how to make your ruby linter highlight only real problems, instead of more-or-less everything. Also, take a crack at customizing your terminal prompt to allow you to more quickly find your input and separate it from what’s being printed to the screen.

  >* From \<Seth Moser>: Working with you was fun, since I haven't worked with you since last mod getting your point of view on topics has been helpful. Something that could help you in the future would maybe spend time learning your keyboard shortcuts for text editors to help you move along your code much easier.


## D: Professional Skills

> \<Intro>

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/<your_name>.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
\<I have never been marginialized the way others have.  I was however born with eyes and ears that have allowed me to see and hear how certain things were/are.  I'm not sure what has made me empathetic and aware of the injustices around us, but I have never doubted my feelings when it comes to these topics.  I continue to want to discuss and engage myself about the whys and why nots, rather than shy away and ignore the problems at hand.>

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
\<I like the idea of grit, as well as the word yet.  Everything worth anything is always harder than imagined.  When facing these challenges you got to push and continue.  There is a point to where you need to step back and make sure you are still taking care of yourself.  It eventually becomes a balancing game, as you learn to balance the things you need in life, the work around you gets easier.>

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
\<This was probably the most fun gear up that I have encountered.  It created a conversation piece about our future and where we are going or potentially going.   At first I was for automation, because I love technology and how we can advance things, and lasers you know, pew pew.  As the realization set in that with automation, millions of people will potentially lose their jobs.  Which is a scary thing, who is going to look out for them? Our government? The State?  Remember bridges to no where?  I don't know how yet, but I have a goal to somehow help people in some way in the future or to at least try.>


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For \<Sam Landfried>:  I thought you did great in leading our group on this project.  You showed character and compassion which is usually hard to find in leaders, in my experience at least.  You were also a person who was in the trenches with us, not just a delegator.  Beyond that you were easy to talk to, even when I didn’t know some of the things going on.  Thanks for everything.
  
  >* For \<Beth Knight>:   You brought some creativity to our project and did it so short of a time.  It was awesome to see some character added to the project overall.  You were always smiling throughout the project, thanks for making things brighter.
  
  >* For \<Mark VanAkeren>:  Mark, I always love the approach you have when it comes to projects and challenges.  You have this grin like you are about to take on a mountain and destroy it.  It brings confidence and positivity which is always needed and should never be lacking.  I always enjoy working with you, as you seem to ask the same questions I’m thinking.  I know I always have a friend when you are around.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For \<Josh Thompson>: Josh, I think you made a great project manager.  You knew how to talk to us and communicate what you wanted.  You were respectful and worded any criticisms well.  Thank you for being encouraging and helping me when I was stuck.  Your calm nature and approach to things is a breath of fresh air.

  >* For \<Seth Moser>: Seth.  As always you are impressive with your knowledge and with the speed at how you do things.  You surprise me with your thoughts, as sometimes you are working on one thing, while thinking about something totally else and solving it at the same time.  This is great, but slow down sometimes and try to vocalize your thought process a little more.  You are going to be a great coder.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<I didn't find a posse that I resonated with, I tried about 3 since the end of last mod and this mod.  I overlooked the TuringLab Posse originally cause I was trying to find a posse where I could grow my skills.  Later I realized I should have joined them at the beginning of this mod, mainly for the fact because they actually made something.>
  
  >* \<I like the mixture of cohorts and both programs. Working with students leading projects was fun and educational.>

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<Being an SAB rep and communicating with the cohort and then back to SAB.  I felt there was a lot more achieved through SAB during this mod.  I think I was also able to bring more to the cohort than I was last mod.>
