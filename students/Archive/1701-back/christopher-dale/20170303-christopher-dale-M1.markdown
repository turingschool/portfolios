# Christopher Dale - M1 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

Continue my education of all things programming.  Specifically getting better with deeper layers of complexity in each of the core-types in ruby.  Explore more programming types and styles.  Gain more confidence in myself to help combat any stressful situations that may arise.  Continue using TDD and developing better edge case test scenarios.  Help my fellow students out as much as I can, to also be able to repay those that have helped me.

Develop new ways or improve upon my ways of dealing with stressful situations and being able to still work effectively while being given more things when they arise.  Being able to stay positive in these situations as well as any other that presents itself.

I also want to grow my network of connections and meet different types of people throughout my career.  Interacting and sharing knowledge is the way forward.

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlBAmATYvSJQpk7PNDQ-0hVUBflzvz7lagtBtFcK3TM/edit?ts=5893bd34) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Night Writer (from Mark Stover): It was great working with you on Night Writer. Your amiable nature and desire to understand the full scope of the project made it very easy to work with you. Every pairing relationship will have technical disparities. To me, these are easily overcome with the right attitude and you certainly have it. The honest, friendly communication we discussed in our DTR provided a great foundation for our work together. It allowed us to fully discuss our approaches to solving the problem, giving each of us the opportunity to express our ideas for solutions in a safe and constructive space. A recommendation I have is, in an instance like trying to allow for capital letters, take enough time to fully understand the problem before searching out a solution. Pull the data into pry and use methods that are familiar to you, to better understand what you are working with. Your enthusiasm for finding a solution is awesome, and I think if you take just a little more time to understand the problem, in the end you will start cranking out wonderfully creative solutions, even faster. Again, it was a pleasure working with you. Your dedication to our project was much appreciated. Keep up the good work!

*   Night Writer (to Mark Stover):It was a pleasure to work with you.  I was happy from day 1 after we sat and talked through the DTR.  I feel it was really constructive and put us on a good footing with each other right off the bat.  I think we made a great team, I hope I was able to give you as much insight as you gave me.  I have a difficult time sometimes with new things and the driver/navigator roles we filled helped me out a lot.  I look forward to working with you in the future and am glad I can call you friend.  Cheers.

*   Black Thursday (from Danny Radden): You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility with working on the project. At first you seemed to have some trouble with methods that traversed different classes, but it seemed to clear up as time went on. You still have some work to do with improving your ruby syntax, but it also improved as the project progressed. Just keep practicing and looking up things in Ruby Docs! I think we both did a pretty good at following TDD guidelines and with our DTR. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well. Thanks for everything!

*   Black Thursday (to Danny Radden): It was a great experience to work with you on Black Thursday.  I feel like I got to know you better as a person and as a student while working on this project together.  I think our DTR was good and everything we set out was met.  You helped explain things in a detailed manner whether we were working next to each other or when you and I had met back up.  I wished we did some white boarding or written in a notebook so I can refer to it later, that might have helped me to try to map some of the methods and what they were doing, so as to allow me more tools to be able to help you. Regardless I appreciated our working together, I look forward to seeing what you are fully capable of.  I think you also should offer your services to more people.  I think the entire school would benefit from it.  Good luck in all your future endeavors.  See you around.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

The idea of growth mindset appeals to me strongly.  The fact that it is in a constant state of flux is what interests me most.  Continually being able to practice working through the motions of gaining a mindset state is great.  It makes us better as human beings in my opinion.  Repeating has helped me grow a better mindset with myself and towards others.  I like to discuss and listen to peoples experiences and see how I can help or learn from them.  This ideology applies to all aspects of life.  What we can learn from what we take away.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
I try to be engaged with the content.  Keeping things organized to an extent where I can grab things quickly.  The challenges I face are like the ones described in the video.  I need to set more paramaters on the time I spend to do things.  Also set a time limit on how long I should work on each thing.  I installed a few tools on my laptop to help with this.   Pivotal and Todoist have opened my eyes on better scheduling controls.

#### Session 3: Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms
In the past I have been able to deal with stress, most of the time effectively.  I like to talk to people the most about problems I have.  I like being able to bounce my thoughts off of them and get a reaction, so that I may weigh their thoughts against mine.  With talking with Allison this mod, she pointed out that I may like a journal or a notebook of some sort so as to be able to write my thoughts for when I have no one I can reach out too.

I would say my struggles with stress are when it just seems to be "too much".  I over analyze things that happen around me and always assume the worst.  It is something I need to work on and fight with continually.
Overall I try to remain happy and positive.  Try to outweigh the negative thoughts when they occur with something positive.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories & Connections
I came to Turing to get a better future.  Reward myself with a fulfilling career, instead of slaving away before death.   Another main reason was to be able to have a family and not be the father who is gone all the time and miss out on the more important things in life.

I look at things in terms of what is fair and what is not.  Some things that drive me are honor, courage and empathy.  We as humans need to work together to have a better life. Empathy is the key in achieving this.  Having the courage to take action and make honorable choices.

I try to share my experiences with people, so they may not make the same mistakes I have made.  I also try to be there for others and listen to them when they need some support.  

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
I don't have the same experiences that are depicted in the documentary.  I'm aware however of the fact that discrimination towards most people.  That those of a different sex and race have probably been a victim to some form of prejudice if not many.  These are not views that I share.  I abhor those that seem to disregard the social challenges we face today.

My part in combating these negative views is being someone who spreads inclusion.  I believe if we spread inclusion we will gain more knowledge and trust between everyone, instead of having judgement clouded in hate.

### Community Participation
I feel that I have been a part of the Turing community in a few ways this mod.  Even though I was nervous about being part of the SAB, I enjoyed it more than I thought.  It was nice to be a part of something where my voice was considered rather than dismissed.  It was also nice to see how the internal workings on one of the aspects of Turing go about their objectives and challenges.  It's great that it is also diverse.  

I helped lead different sessions throughout the mod with Dan Olson.  Our sessions focused on some of the different exercises and ruby concepts that Turing uses.  Each session was designed to go slowly over and with pace of our attendees.  Our hope was that we would be able to solidify some of the early workings ruby.  We advanced with each week, trying to keep pace with the content of the mod without being overwhelming.  I'm considering continuing the sessions next mod.

On a personal level, I tried to be there for all in our cohort.  I have been open each week about students being able to come talk to me, whether it was SAB related or not.  Anytime on slack or in person if anyone vocalized needing help or having stress, I reached out to them and offered my services.

With the group of repeaters from 1611, I believe we all helped each other and were there for one another.  We all took turns of having strong moments and tough moments.  The experience from both mods has made our connections with each other more unique and stronger.  I also see our positivity and actions are spurring others along to do the same for others.
