Christopher Dale - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn everything, this is all new-ish to me.  Halfway through, I made my goal to be able to
read code and understand what it is doing, almost right away, at least faster than what I can do
as well as be able to write reactively to anything I see.  I look forward to being able to repeat
and have reflected on what I can do to improve this next time around.  One of the biggest challenges
and probably the most detrimental, was the fact of trying to learn a mac and it's idiosyncrasies, as well
as git-hub, terminal, text-editors, on top of trying to learn the core curriculum.  This isn't an excuse,
I am just ready to try again and succeed with knew understanding and determination!

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects
I found the pace of everything in the beginning so fast, compared to what I was keeping up with.  As time went on it got harder to keep up and understand.  As I finished Flashcards, my work process and understanding of what was going on increased and I am ready to tackle all the projects again.


#### (Flashcards)

A TDD written project, each aspect was tested as it was implemented.  The project is set up to take
just a txt file and turn it into flashcard style questions.  Complete with feedback responses and percentage ratio. I enjoyed this project.  It helped bring me the confidence I needed.

## C: Group Work & Projects
  Taught me how to communicate better, not just on content of the project, but also on our interactions.
### Projects

My first paired project with a fellow student

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cdale3/Enigma_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/enigma.markdown)

The infamous Enigma machine and how it almost works!  This project is about halfway finished.  It can encrypt, just need to finish the decrypt.

ten tests, passing 2 not passing
there is no Enigma class
Decrypt and Encrypt class has a lot of code repetition, would like to have seen them treated as runners
Character map should be pulled out to separate class,
Application does not function

1. Overall Functionality
    1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

3. Test-Driven Development
    2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

4. Breaking Logic into Components
    2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/tree/master/m1_citizenship

Overall the gear ups have been quite interesting and offer a new thought process on things.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

Past experiences have helped me have a growth-mindset at what it means to think about other things, through those mind-sets.  When I was young, I believe everyone had a good family environment, because I did, that means a mother and a father.  It took seeing several friends going through different family hardships to understand that my world wasn't theirs.  It holds true that I had tough times, but I knew that I had it better than most, and yet, I could still sympathize to a certain degree.  For most of my childhood life, my father was always away working.  I saw him about 1.5 days out of the 7 in a week.  This was probably one of my first major break through in empathizing with others.  I hold to this day, that no one can ascertain your hardships, until they walk in your shoes.  

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_norms.markdown

Different actions to take for me to be successful at Turing:  Only in the last few weeks am I being able to break down a few walls, whether it was a personal wall or a wall due to lack of understanding.  In the beginning it was tough to do this.  Going forward, I want to remember both sides of those feelings, so as to recognize when I need to ask for help and seek it out, rather than trying to push myself so hard and achieve nothing.  Doing the introvert/extrovert gear up, was nice to practice out.  Seeing how others were and what they did was valuable to me.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown

My first half of the mod that I was here, I was a little(a lot) prideful and too stubborn to realize I needed to change that up.  As I started to realize I was going to need help with understanding and articulating the work we were doing, I started to chisel away at that pride.  I started to ask for help from fellow students.  It was a success to a degree.  I found it to be an even greater personal achievement when I was able to take the things others had showed me and "pass it forward".  It's a liberating and rewarding experience to be able to be humble and then to be confident.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

Echoing Carol Dweck's TED talk, Duckworth's explanation of grit was impactful to me.  Both of these speakers touched at points that I had experienced in my life.  Letter grades and how they can make you feel like you're a failure, in the past that was easy to encounter.  Now that I am older and hopefully wiser, I understand and am not afraid to keep trying to do challenges that occur in my life.  Understanding grit and trying to identify it within yourself is massively important, to which I wish I had more grit in areas when I was growing up.  I can still use it today though and tomorrow.


#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

  An article that highlights the aspects of this country's "opportunities" that one may receive while living here.
  It does it's job in being informative and talking to you about what is important in those key issues.
  However, I don't see us caring in the slightest, or upholding these values and ideologies.  How many people have died in 2016, how many of those people were Americans
  who have a different skin pigmentation than others?  (I read another article today that talks about not using the term African-American, because we are all American, this applies to all Americans and those that would be considered "Something-American") They had the right to protection and fair trials.  They instead got bullets as their "right to use public libraries, roads, transportation, parks,   >>>  POLICE   <<<  fire services, etc. The responsibility to pay the taxes which support such services."

  I feel for these people every day.  Too young and for far too stupid of a reason to kill.  I am passionate about this subject and bring it up
  because at the end of the day, there was a person behind that gun who shot and killed.  Right now I think we need to change the individual before we can
  change our country to become better as a whole.  As a freedom. As a choice. As a right to live!  We need to change the HATE mantra that is set before us.
  It isn't just one side of Americans who are under scrutiny and attacks and torture and persecution and prejudice.  HATE BEGETS HATE, LOVE WILL BEGET LOVE.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Maria,
  I’m not even sure how to describe what you have been able to do for me as well as others.  I wanted to say you are a rock, but you have been more than that to us.
  The things that make you like a rock are the patience and determination that one usually holds with that title.  However, I think why it is inappropriate to call you this,
  is because a rock doesn’t come to the ones that need help, it’s quite the opposite.  So I think the word I would strongly use is Friend.

Dan
 You have been an inspiration for me.  I am one who is always able to give advice, but harder for me to believe in it when it comes to me trying to apply that advice to myself.  So I can’t measure the amount of appreciation I have that you saw this, and helped me push out into my open and active thought process.  Helping me to not be negative and remembering to putting one step forward, always.   I am one with the force; the force is with me!

 Mike Schutte
 I personally wanted to say thank you, again, for running the drills-for-skills program.  It is a huge thing to spend time with others and help them, it shows compassion and caring about the content you are learning/teaching, as well as your commitment to the school and it’s denizens.  Keep going forward, I look forward to what you may be able to pass on to me in the future.

Drills-for-Skills feedback (ran by mike schutte),
  This is an awesome program/service that a good amount of us have utilized.  It helps build confidence in learning and talking about the material.  It was nice to see that it was flexible and comfortable to attend.  The further discovery of Code Wars is great to see, that there are several ways to learn something.  Looking forward to this being a continuing thing, and what it may be become in the future.


### Being a Community Member

From Dan Olson
Chris has been an inspiration to me. Since day one I have seen himself push himself to the limit to understand the material. Even though he struggled I saw vast improvements in readability of code and understanding of class relationships. I also see him reaching out and trying to be a part of every learning opportunity that he can get his hands on. You can't teach this kind of desire to learn. His grit drives me to be better. The night is darkest at dawn, and thats where Chris thrives. Thank you Chris!

Chris! I think you are a great addition to our cohort as you always add some comic relief when stress/tensions are running high! It has been lots of fun working on drills with
you and really solidifying some of the concepts (there are sooo many, ahhh!). I have seen tremendous improvement from you over these weeks, particularly in the latter part of
the cohort. I can see when concepts are starting to stick, and that increases your confidence, and that is enjoyable to witness! When you were making progress on an exercise,
your focus and drive to actually learn the concept (not just commit to memory) is commendable, and will serve you well going forward. Keep that inner fire!  You don't hesitate to seek out others in the cohort for support, and I think having a solid support system in the module has been really beneficial specifically to you (but this also applies to others in the cohort, including myself). I was glad to see that I could alleviate some of the pressure when you were struggling, and you also made yourself available and checked in with me often, which I really appreciate!

From Mike Schutte
Chris, thanks for coming out to Drills for Skills this module. I know it was a bit unorganized at points, being a new initiative, but you always brought a positive attitude
and meaningful contributions. I think your commitment to expose yourself to more code an to talk about it in a more relaxed setting will pay off as you progress through Turing. See you at the next drill!

### Playing a Part

I believed I helped the larger portions of the community just by being here and participating with them with
whatever was our current assignment or gear up or activity.  Always just being friendly to new faces and making connections with others in the school.  In our direct cohort I was able to be more effective at helping with emotions and projects.  Once I learned something, I tried to help others who needed it, so as to help them and
help burn the information into my skull.  The emotional portion of this statement, I think is much bigger than
anything else.  I don't know how I would have continued without the friends I made here.  They in return are
telling me the same thing.
