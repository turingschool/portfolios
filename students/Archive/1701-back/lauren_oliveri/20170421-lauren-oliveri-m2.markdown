# Lauren Oliveri - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> I set out to start piecing together ruby with rails to make functional, tangible, and helpful applications. Last module was way easier for me, partially because I kept to and focused on myself during the module, and also partially due to some advantages of my engineering background. During this module, I challenged myself to participate more in the Turing community, and make helping others more of a priority.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** |4 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 4|
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* I feel super confident in the work that I produced in Module 2. I would go above and beyond on some of the tutorials or unevaluated projects (like Job Tracker) to ensure I was understanding these new and foreign concepts.
>* In addition to my work, I feel like I definitely branched out this module from a community perspective and focused on projects to help Turing and work with others.

-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | PASS |
| **Written Diagnostic** | PASS |

>* I greatly enjoyed my End-of-Module Assessment with Beth. Since I had already implemented all of the extension features for Job Tracker, Beth made up some complicated features for me to write, and while I ran out of time on the second feature, I had a lot of fun and was proud of my work and approach.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
>* [Asset Pipeline](https://lao9.github.io/blog.html)
>* I have a few non-technical posts from my pre-work on my personal website as well, but I'd really like to write a few more about some helpful RSpec resources I've written for classmates, and also a blog post summarizing my flexbox lightning talk. Maybe I'll get to it over break!

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> I found Blogger & Mix Master to be super helpful, and referenced them frequently throughout the remainder of Module 2. From these tutorials, I came away with a way better understanding of:
* feature testing (especially using capybara)
* rails shortcuts, migrations, and helpers (like form_for)
* routing using specially scoped or nested routes


#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> * Job Tracker is where a lot of concepts really clicked for me. I really pushed myself to write a ton of tests, [keep a production site functional](https://murmuring-falls-34830.herokuapp.com/), and do as many extensions and features as I could!
> * For my rails mini project, I worked with a few other ladies in my class on updating the 'Wellness Tracker' that Allison has to update and send out weekly. I was really proud of our work, but we got super bogged down when we tried to use Turing's census for our authentication service. We were able to get it up and running with Github, but without Turing census we think it will be a barrier to proper usage. I fully intend to finish the project as soon as we can meet with some Turing folks about proper 'census' implementation!


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* Bike Share is a Sinatra application built around the Bay Area's bike share data. It provides a list of all stations, trips, and weather conditions from August 2013 - August 2015. It also conducts some analytics for these entities using ActiveRecord to query the database.
>* I'm really glad we got to do this project. I solidified my understanding of building a database, plus understanding cardinality between tables. Building the application in Sinatra also really helped me learn the MVC model, and also appreciate the magic of Rails shortly afterward.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* Our 'Little Shop' Rails application is an e-commerce web platform called 'We Can Pickle That' loosely based upon our instructor's experience with artisan pickling, and also the Portlandia sketch about pickling literally anything.
>* The application was super fun to build, and helped reinforce a ton of concepts. I especially benefitted from the specific routing that we needed to do to give specific admin privileges, prevent users from accessing pages they shouldn't be able to see, and also to meet certain client criteria for what they wanted the URLs to be named (like the category name one!).

> Bike Share evaluation comments:
>* You've gained a pretty deep understanding of the power of AR; share that knowledge! (spike, post-class session)
>* It's pretty expertly divided; the controller is dry (pushed most logic to models), should look into extracting POROS (classes/modules that don't correspond to tables/db; could extract a math module, and a parser to package params to pass into models
>* Can clean up validations to be all part of one validates function in models.
>* In future projects, be more aware of individual commits; commit often & split up driving responsibilities. (evaluation scores)

> Little Shop evaluation comments:
>* Awesome
>* Really thorough test suite and execution of above-and-beyond features and extensions
>* Great styling and ease of navigation for the user
>* Within the scope of the project, the view logic is sound and could have even be made more succinct with partials
>* Suggestion to make analytics more efficient: make order total and quantity attributes of an order instead of just methods of orders

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Victoria Vasys:
    * Lauren, it was a *real* delight working with you on Bike Share! I especially appreciate your super-strong work ethic, dedication to going above-and-beyond what’s asked for, and willingness & ability to jump outside of whatever you were doing in order to help someone else on the team. Your problem-solving & debugging skills are impeccable & I learned a lot from your workflow! I was super proud and inspired by our entire team’s donation of time and effort & I’m really grateful for the times that you powered through until you found the best solution (especially with DateTime intricacies and automated table formation!), for always staying on top of that good ol’ Waffle Board, and for all of the extra punch you packed at the end, CSS stylin’. I think aside from the wild amount of work we all dedicated to making such a stellar project, my favorite thing about working with our team was our tendency to be goofy & basically create a musical out of our work hehe. Thanks for contributing such a positive, light-hearted attitude in what could have otherwise been a really painful project! I’m super excited to get to be working with you again on the Wellness Challenge :slightly_smiling_face:
  >* From Brett Shwartz:
    * Lauren, it was a pleasure working with you on this project. Back in Mod1, we didn’t get to many opportunities to work together so i’m glad we were able to work together on a project to kick off Mod2. I thought you did a great job of owning certain aspects of the project. For example, you did a great job of completing the station dashboard while the other members of the group were working on different iterations. You also used you knowledge from your ‘flex box’ lightning talk to give our web app so awesome styling! Even though you were ‘driving’ when we were styling our webpage, you were still open to ideas from other group members which I thought was awesome. Although you weren’t our official ‘project manager’, I still thought you did a great job of consistently going back to our waffle board to keep us organized. Overall, I enjoyed working with you throughout this project and also getting to know you better outside of school. Looking forward to working with you on future projects!
  >* From Danny Radden:
    * Hi Lauren! Working with you on Bike Share was a fantastic experience.  I admire your hard work and incredible cognitive resources endurance. For example, you would spend all day with us working on the project and then go home and add splendid styling to make our project look no longer like vomit. You are super smart and have a genuine thirst for problem solving. You blazed right through those dashboard methods in amazing fashion. I love how even if you know that something works, you need will often need to dive into it yourself to see exactly what is going on. Also, Your great sense of humor helped to keep things relaxed leading to a very stress free project. I think this is the part where I am supposed to give constructive feedback, but I cant think of any. I really hope I get to work with you again in the future! :shark:

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Jack Pincus:
    * Big ups for really going HAM on this shit. You managed to really drive this project to an incredible result while still being friendly and awesome. I think that the fact that we never had a late night is amazing for a Turing Project. I'm always jealous of your ability to always seek perfection in your work. This is one of those great situations where I'm not sure what I can tell you to improve on. 12/10 would code with again. Pickles
  >* From Joseph Glass:
    * You did a fantastic job managing our project. The way you broke down features to clear, well-defined, test-ready user stories made a huge difference in our workflow. I never realized how much energy I wasted trying to code to vague specs until this project. It's clear you're willing to go the extra mile and do more than your fair share of the work, while at the same time always giving credit to others. You have excellent coding instincts, and notice untapped efficiencies and refactoring opportunities, in team workflow as well as code. Don't be afraid to critique your teammates' work, we'll be even better programmers for your insights!
  >* From Andrew Mossefin:
    * Hey Lauren. First and foremost, you absolutely CRUSHED it as the project manager. As we talked about in the eval, the fact that you chopped every task and item into a detailed individual card on waffle.io made things so much easier for everyone and gave us all clear direction on the project. You also still remain the undisputed git flow master. Very glad that I had you in my group and we finally were able to work together. Only input would be that sometimes when you get into the zone, I know I’d appreciate if you communicated more clearly on things you want to change or were changing. For example, when performing your git wizardry (teach me your ways!). That’s the only think i can’t think of. Other than that, you are an absolute champ. Very proud of what we accomplished on this, and I think you were one of the biggest driving factors in that.


## D: Professional Skills

> In Mod 2, I continued to develop my ability to collaborate in teams, code using an agile workflow, give and receive feedback, and think about myself and future career in a greater context. After Turing, I plan to move to Boston and I've started to slowly build a network out there and have even already completed a job interview!

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/lauren_oliveri.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
I enjoyed this exercise, and would have liked even more time to discuss as a cohort! I'm grateful that our cohort it particularly open-minded, and I think better than most about 'checking their privilege', but there's still always more progress to be made. The guys in my discussion group were pretty surprised when I brought up some of the tactics I use to stay and feel safe walking alone at night (I mentioned that it's not uncommon for me to be very suspicious of flyers or items placed on my windshield as bait for me to get out of a car). I felt that the exercise helped me to recognize other privileges I take for granted, such as citizen status, English as my first language, and coming from a two-parent household.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown) From what I understand, 'grit' is a combination of perseverance, growth mindset, and passion. I think 'purpose' should also be added to grit's definition. Am I powering through this project all night to get an A (self-preservation motivation), or am I genuinely learning and enjoying? Without reminding yourself of the goal, you could possibly stay up all night and produce garbage code and learn nothing, which isn't grit rather unguided discipline and maybe a little procrastination...

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
After much discussion and thought, I'm still not sure where I stand on the topic of automation. It's scary to think that 50% of jobs may be eliminated in the foreseeable future, but I'm hopeful that with the introduction of new technologies, new opportunities arise. I think that unless the rate of automation is regulated, our government will need to seriously consider basic income for those that cannot get skilled work in the new automated economy. After this Gear Up, I am more mindful of the effects or my work, and possibly the effects of automation on my own future career.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Victoria Vasys:
    * Victoria, it was such a pleasure working with you on this project! I really can’t think of any “constructive” feedback for you, or really anyone in our group. I think that speaks to each person being kind, ambitious, hard-working, and open to other ideas and methods of implementation. I’m super proud of the product that we delivered, and felt that we all learned a TON. As our Project Manager, I felt that you were highly organized, always took notes during evaluations and helped us make waffle cards to keep us on track for the duration of the project. It was REALLY appreciated. I also thought you did a good job of keeping us on track in a kind, but helpful manner when we’d goof off or get stuck on something. (You also recognized when a good giggle was appropriate/needed.) You’re also just generally a super hard-working person, and when you said you’d work on something, you always did. I can’t emphasize enough your consistency and reliability. Those google charts were dank. Additionally, when you were stuck and asked for someone’s help, I thought you did a good job of providing background and context for the issue! Overall, you are a funny, goofy, and chill person that made busting through such a difficult and length project really enjoyable!
  >* For Brett Shwartz:
    * Brett, it was such a pleasure working with you on this project! I really can’t think of any “constructive” feedback for you, or really anyone in our group. I think that speaks to each person being kind, ambitious, hard-working, and open to other ideas and methods of implementation. I’m super proud of the product that we delivered, and felt that we all learned a TON. I greatly appreciated your consistent and focused efforts on projects. I felt that you always stepped up to work on something you were uncomfortable doing (learning ActiveRecord, seeding, etc.) and always delivered something solid and tangible. I admire that you and others in our group wanted to make progress, but learn at the same time. You also knew everyone’s limits and encouraged us to take a break to get some food or coffee, which helped us step away and noodle on tough problems. Additionally, when you were stuck and asked for someone’s help, I thought you did a good job of providing background and context for the issue! Overall, you are a funny, light-hearted person that made busting through such a difficult and length project really enjoyable!
  >* For Danny Radden:
    * Danny, it was such a pleasure working with you on this project! I really can’t think of any “constructive” feedback for you, or really anyone in our group. I think that speaks to each person being kind, ambitious, hard-working, and open to other ideas and methods of implementation. I’m super proud of the product that we delivered, and felt that we all learned a TON. I really appreciated your hard work into seeding the large csvs so elegantly, trying to make the dashboards faster with more advanced active record at the 11th hour, and working on trying to deploy to heroku! Despite your already advanced ruby knowledge, I’m grateful that you spent the time explaining anything you worked on, and additionally was always open to feedback, new ideas or implementation approaches. Overall, you are a funny, goofy, and chill person that made busting through such a difficult and length project really enjoyable!

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Jack Pincus:
    * Hey Jack! Really enjoyed working with you on the little shop project. If I had any constructive feedback for you, it's really small things like continue writing feature and model tests before functionality (you knew this was coming, come on). As mentioned in today's eval, if I could change something about the project implementation, it would be making sure the following was a clearly articulated best practice for our git workflow: 1. pull down from master, 2. merge master with your current branch, and 3. run RSpec before pushing/making a pull request to ensure your new code also passes any recent code that was merged to master since you last pulled down. You are clearly a strong coder, and I felt that you and your work was always super reliable. I appreciated your "let's build only what we need" approach and found that you expressed your ideas and any issues you encountered clearly. I also knew that if I was running into any issues, I'd be able to pull you aside and you could quickly jump into the issue with me and help me out. You're hard-working and produced some awesome stuff this project (like the mailers!!!). I'm ridiculously proud of our project and had a ton of fun and laughs with you!
  >* For Joseph Glass:
    * Hey Joseph! Really enjoyed working with you on the little shop project. You're thorough, kind, and clearly a strong coder. Like me, you're super organized and good at making sure our ducks were in a row after every check-in with Beth on top of other little random feature ideas, etc. I knew that if I was running into any issues, I'd be able to pull you aside and you could quickly jump into the issue with me and help me out. You produced some really awesome stuff during this mod (like implementing paperclip and that sick admin sales analysts page!!!). I'm ridiculously proud of our project! I really appreciated your help and calm demeanor during this project and I hope we get to work together again at some point in Mod 3!
  >* For Andrew Mossefin:
    * Hey Andrew! Really enjoyed working with you on the little shop project. If I had any constructive feedback for you, it's fine tune your git workflow. As mentioned in today's eval, if I could change something about the project implementation, it would be making sure the following was a clearly articulated best practice for our git workflow: 1. pull down from master, 2. merge master with your current branch, and 3. run RSpec before pushing/making a pull request to ensure your new code also passes any recent code that was merged to master since you last pulled down. You're funny and did a flipping awesome job on our project's styling. I think aside from all the neat features we implemented in our project, the styling really tied it together and set the stage for an awesome user experience. I really appreciate all the work you did to get it looking as professional as it did, with lots of funny little tid bits and flair. I'm ridiculously proud of our project!
#### **Posse**
  >* I co-led the Hamilton posse this module with Maria Stenquist, and we held a few spikes regarding planning and implementation of our major project, the Wellness App!
  >* My favorite part of the posse experience was working with a front-end student to make our rails application look even more legit.
  >* I think the experience helped really fine tune my Project Management and collaboration skills. It also just felt like good practice to work on a project with others while all fine-tuning ours rails skills.

#### **Playing a Part**

> In addition to leading a posse and working on a  side project to benefit the Turing community, I have been pairing with students in both Mod 1 and Mod 2. I always try to offer my assistance to others and do my best to share information that I've compiled for myself to help my classmates.

> For example, I wrote out some basic RSpec guidelines and posted in our backend ~*exclusive*~ channel. People were a little bit confused about when to use it vs. scenario vs. feature vs. describe vs. context even after Jeff's wild RSpec lesson, and I felt I had a pretty good handle on the syntax.

------------------
