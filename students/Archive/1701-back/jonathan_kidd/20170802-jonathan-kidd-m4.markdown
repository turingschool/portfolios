## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

>This inning, I am focused on both reviewing and practicing those skills I have gained while here, as well as get a start on my journey of learning JavaScript and some client-side development. I also hope to practice/demonstrate more independence in solving problems by relying on the processes I have cultivated while at Turing. Additionally, as there is time, I want to do all that I can to prepare myself for interviews and the professional world.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

>Pass, after revisions.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>My biggest challenge was getting jQuery to work properly, namely allowing URLs to be both marked read and unread.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>I liked the chance to review jQuery - the week previous to the assessment I had spent solely in React, and it was good to get stretched back the other way.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>The successful approach ended up being a methodical one. Initially, I had thrown code at the wall to get it half working. In fixing it up, I took the action piece by piece to find out where exactly it was breaking, and then was able to try different strategies in a much narrower context.

* What did you learn?

>I learned (reinforced) the importance of not letting myself get mired in one thing for too long. Moving on to other problems and coming back later is perfectly OK, and often preferable. It allows your brain a diffuse moment to keep working on the problem, giving you new ideas to try when you come back to it later.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>The most challenging part of Quantified Self was being thrown into JavaScript to accomplish what would otherwise be fairly straightforward in Rails, while also using a new framework. It was a matter of digesting a few new concepts at once (like having two codebases, and making asynchronous calls to the database) while using a new language. Testing was especially difficult, using Selenium Webdriver.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>The most effective way to solve the challenge was to first experiment - discover the boundaries of what works and what breaks. Then, it was a matter of research, looking up the way others have solved similar challenges. Finally, learning the patterns made it easier to keep moving forward.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>It was really fun to be able to realize I can do something in a new language. It made me excited to learn more JavaScript, see what else is out there.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

>Having a separate front and back end repository, making them work together.

>Making AJAX calls to the database to work with data without a refresh.

>How require statements work in JavaScript - exporting functions and such. Also a good reinforcement of refactoring that translates back to Ruby.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

>I would have liked the chance to incorporate more Object Oriented JavaScript. As it was, we did not have time to refactor our somewhat messy code into such.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

>I was lucky to work with Lauren on this project. It really helped to have someone to bounce ideas off of and struggle through problems with. It helped me to not stay stuck for very long, when otherwise I may have ended up frustrated.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

>My biggest technical challenge was including the map in my VolunTellMe app. I used react-google-maps, but the documentation and examples I found were not very helpful.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

>I broke down the issues, and tackled them one by one. I first got the map to render on the page, then made the call for data, then got the data into markers and got those on the map, then got the info window working for each marker, and finally added a link to those info windows.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

>It was great to have a chance for incremental wins, which kept me motivated to keep working. I also enjoyed the chance to both learn new techniques and reinforce React concepts in general (e.g. the component itself is different from my other components, but it is also still a component).

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

>React components, testing with Jest and Enzyme, and using React Router in a single-page app.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

>This mod, I have had the chance to do several mock interviews, during which I received feedback about my approach and struggles with coding challenges. I expressed my appreciation and took notes on the areas for improvement that were mentioned - and didn't take it personally.


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

>I worked with four other Mod 4 students to put together a Gear Up on body language. I was lucky to be in a group that was organized and came up with plenty of ideas to choose from. We worked well together, whittling down our ideas to a well-planned lesson. I enjoyed the process quite a bit, and think it is a valuable exercise to undertake.

>The biggest challenge was external to the actual session, in that by the time week 5 rolled around, I was juggling so many things that I had totally forgotten about conducting the session at the end of that week. I would have liked to prepare a bit more, with a practice run through, but had too much on my plate to do so.

>I felt rewarded that the students in our class were quite participatory. Folks had very perceptive thoughts, and were were able to have a deep conversation about body language.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

>I have greatly enjoyed the community aspects of Turing during my time here. This mod, I continued to stay involved by participating in the Productivity and Imposters lunches. This has given me an opportunity to meet people from different programs, learn about them, and share about me.

>I think this is a rightly a required experience because it pushes the community to be the best it can possibly be, as individuals who are invested in something treat it better. I also think it offers the opportunity to examine one's own privilege and advantages.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

>Technical problem solving skills and process - I feel confident I can solve never-before-seen issues by breaking down the problem and putting in the research. I have been stretched and challenged to do so in every mod at Turing. I include in this the ability to Google the right thing.

>Telling my story - I am more able to articulate my story, especially as it relates to my transition through Turing and into the tech world.

>Time management and task prioritization - I have had plenty of (painful) opportunities to see my procrastination tendencies at work, including the triggers and time-filler busy work. The massive amount to get done at Turing has allowed me to find antidotes that work for me.
