# Jonathan Kidd - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module, I set out to go beyond my basic knowledge of Rails (though I wanted to continue to reinforce along the way), to produce and consume APIs. I was also interested in learning more about SQL, and get an introduction to jQuery, AJAX, and background workers. By and large, I hit all these areas of emphasis.

>* I have satisfactorily met all the requirements of the module, though I know there are areas I would like to further bolster, and lots of review to do. I also have been less active in networking/job hunt/research than I would like to be.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* An exploration of consuming an API. I consumed the GitHub API. This project also involved the use of new tools and testing techniques while working with an external API.
>* This project challenged me to overcome a conceptual hurdle, and I got a lot out of it. The purpose and format of an API is much more clear, as is using plain Ruby objects, with separate responsibilities, in a Rails app.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* For this project, my partner and I built an API using static data from multiple CSV's. This project involved advanced ActiveRecord and SQL queries, as well as new testing techniques.
>* This project was great for learning how to produce an API, and also was a great chance to practice/learn more about SQL and ActiveRecord. I enjoyed it.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/jk1dd/grab_bag)**
>* We build a version of Dropbox. It involved multi-tenancy and a more complex schema.
>* This was a brain bender - trying to have folders that can be within folders, and files within those. I learned tons.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/josh-works/corkboard)**
>* We took over Corkboard (version of Thumbtack), to add additional features.
>* Working with brownfield code was a totally different experience - in some ways more difficult, but in a different way. It involved tracing back how the app was configured, and trying to puzzle out why decisions were made they way they were made. Then, it took some deeper thinking to figure out how to put your individual user story into existing code.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
This session was a good reminder to think about those things that are not often thought about it 'default' mode. Aggression can come through many different channels, and is not always on purpose. I appreciated hearing the perspectives of others in the class, who have a different experience than I.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
I was not able to attend this session in person (excused), but going over the lesson later, I was reminded of the importance of making intentional choices to be around people who are different than you, and sometimes requirements for this can be beneficial.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
Black Mirror and Social Media. We had a chance to view part of an episode of Black Mirror and discuss the content. It was a dystopian and extreme take on social media, about a world where people are judged on their 'social media score.' We drew some parallels with our world, and our part of the responsibility for it as developers. As someone who generally lurks rather than participates, I agreed with some of the points (as to the dangers of social media), and disagreed with others (the extreme to which the episode took it, and the fact that it is not exactly designer's 'fault' that people enjoy 'like' functionality, but rather a demand of the market).


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Besides general involvement with the community, I wrote a blog post on a tricky asset pipeline issue, which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jklafdjklveo/troubleshooting-the-un-troubleshootable-in-rails-5-0-1-3bd2c60d367e)

#### **Posse**
  >* I was involved with Pahlka posse this mod, and assisted with the development of the backend of an application, where data about food stores was served up as an API to be consumed by a map feature on the front end.
  >* I enjoyed working with people not in my mod or program, and also enjoyed working on an optional project.
  >* I have a stronger vision for working on things outside of requirements, trying new technologies and processes, and tackling issues that matter to society.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I have remained involved with my cohort and the community - attending stand-ups, keeping the school (generally) clean, and interacting with others whenever possible.
