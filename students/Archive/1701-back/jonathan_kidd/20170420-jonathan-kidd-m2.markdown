# Jonathan Kidd - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module, I set out to expand on the fundamental Ruby I learned in the first module, by constructing database-backed web-applications. I aimed to learn about the tools available for building such applications, and good practices in applying them. Additionally, I wanted to learn more about group work in larger team settings, and how to improve git workflow and agile project management. By and large, I feel I succeeded in attaining these goals.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |

| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

>* In most areas, I exceeded my own expectations, as I gained skill in both technical areas and personal balance. I was diligent about completing the homework each night, and was an active participant in class and group work.

-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | PASS |
| **Written Diagnostic** | PASS |

>* The end of module assessments were a good confirmation of my areas of strengths as well as a few areas for improvement, especially regarding thinking through tests to ensure they are complete.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [What Makes Good Rails Routes?](https://medium.com/@jklafdjklveo/what-makes-good-rails-routes-bd882eefb6e4)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> Blogger and Mix Master were great introductions to Rails. I found both projects enjoyable, and though they felt a bit overwhelming at first (especially with so many new words to read and parse and follow), in retrospect they provided a great foundation for later, more independent work. Mix Master was also helpful getting me started down the path to using Heroku to host applications.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> Job Tracker and the Rails Mini Project were where my learning began to solidify. They were another chance to practice the basics (at first), and then led me to be more challenged with things like custom routes - which helped firm up the idea of how the MVC model works. Consuming the Giphy API was a fun challenge in my Mini Project, and I look forward to learning more.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* Using Sinatra, our team of four built an app that analyzed and displayed data about a Bike Sharing program in San Francisco.
>* This was a chance to practice CRUD-ing resources and an introduction to the power of ActiveRecord. I found ActiveRecord queries to be the most challenging part of the project, as it was tempting to fall back on Ruby to get our calculations done. In the end, though, the challenge (and 2 AR category during the assessment) spurred me to take a greater interest in learning more ActiveRecord, and I think I am much more solid on the way objects relate and the many ways they can be queried.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* Our team of four built a shop for 'mingled' animals, using Rails. The instructor acted as a Product Owner who delivered user stories in chunks, and also gave us feedback along the way.
>* This project was very enjoyable, as we were able to select our own 'product' to sell. The slightly more 'real-world' aspect of the project was also nice, as we were given the work to do in chunks, which helped our pace and quality of work.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Josh Thompson:

  >Jonathan. Really thoughtful and methodical. I most enjoyed pairing directly with you on Sunday and Tuesday. I’d encourage you to be more assertive with your ideas and directions. You’re very attentive to what your partner is thinking, but don’t ever give them so much space that you’re sacrificing some of your “own” time, if that makes sense.


  >* From Stephanie Bentley:

  >Jonathan: Thank you  for your even-keeled, calm and collected attitude throughout this project. For me, a challenging project coupled with group dynamics can elevate stress and anxiety levels quickly.  I appreciated your ability to stay focused and keep a cool head despite (what had the potential to be) overwhelming factors.


  >* From Seth Moser:

  >It was great working with you on this project since last mod we didn't really do much, and the experience was great, your ability to see other's point of view and ideas was really helpful and cool to see, but maybe being a little more strong on your own ideas might be a good idea for the next time.

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Maria Stenquist:

  >Jonathan! You were awesome to work with on the Little Shop project. You approached the project with a great attitude, which contributed to a comfortable atmosphere to work in as a group. I appreciated how you were always willing to pair on something, and helped me get over some small speed-bumps that I needed a second pair of eyes on, or just needed to voice out loud what a piece of functionality was doing. A couple of your strengths in the project were driving forward RSpec tests, as well as a bigger-picture of how the code is interacting in the project, which was helpful for us to keep the project scope in mind, and moving forward. I had to give it some thought for some constructive feedback for you in the future, and the one thing I came up with: you have really great ideas & strong technical skills, I think taking more leadership or expressing your ideas more quickly would have steered our project in a positive way. In addition, I think you have great teaching skills as I learned a lot from your explanations in our pairings, and I think you would be great at leading a spike for Turing students (I look forward to attending it!). I think your calm demeanor & open-approach being valuable to you as a developer on a team, and I foresee you being a great project lead/having leadership skills in an impactful way for whichever organization you join post-Turing. Hopefully we get to work again in a group at Turing or beyond.

  >* From Danny Radden: TBD


  >* From Sam Landfried:

  >You’re an excellent partner, and it has been a delight collaborating with you. You’re always engaged, focused, levelheaded and nice. I especially appreciated your interest in engaging in a real pair programming dynamic. I think it was a good learning opportunity for both of us to express our technical ideas out loud. You also helped me come to a personal realization when you urged the group to claim ownership of our time. We were in a spot where we couldn’t make scheduling decisions because everyone kept saying, “Anything is fine for me,” and it would have been much easier had one of us just said, “I need these hours off.” I encourage you to continue pointing out issues with group workflow. I don’t have much to offer in terms of constructive feedback since it seems like you’re doing a good job technically and collaboratively. You can be soft spoken at times, and while that wasn’t a problem in our group, I can imagine a scenario where you get steam rolled and that would be unfortunate for that group, since your opinion is obviously more important than that hypothetical jerk that is steam rolling you. Anyways, this project has really been a great experience for me, in large part because of your influence on the group, so thank you!


## D: Professional Skills

> [Gist Reflections](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/jonathan_kidd.md)

>This module I focused on further developing the interpersonal and project management skills that, in the workplace, are often as or more important than technical skills. I learned a great deal about feedback and examined how I come across, as well as how others view me. I also learned more about the Agile process, and had practice reaching out to strangers in the industry for professional guidance and networking.

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/jonathan_kidd.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
This was a valuable exercise examining privilege and marginalization. I have seen the privilege statement list a few times before, but it always uncovers something new - this time I was struck by now I can live my life with basically no fear of others around me. Also, it is a great reminder that some of the advantages and disadvantages folks hold are not always visible - for example, a traumatic childhood could happen to anyone, regardless of race or socio-economic status. I continue to reflect on what advantages and disadvantages I have, and seek to understand others', as part of being more empathetic and appreciating and enjoying working with people different than me.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
This lesson presented grit as a combination of passion and perseverance. On the whole, I would agree, although I posit that there is an important addition of working 'smart' (both in what you do, in a self-reflective and evolving way, and how you do it), rather that just powering through a large volume of work and calling it grit. My own grit has increased here at Turing - I have come to enjoy the pace of work (usually), and find myself missing it when it is not there. Something I hope to develop is a greater sense of grit around independent work. I have generally done my best/most work in a structured environment, but I want to learn to do more on my own.

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
Automation will either save us or destroy us all. The rapid increase/improvement of technology has the potential to make the world a better place, providing for the basic needs of all humans, or it has the potential to exacerbate the inequality already present in many societies (both economically 'developing' and 'developed'). I tend to be fairly pessimistic that our society values the things that would save us - like re-training, improving the education system, and providing for the basic needs of all citizens - but I continue to strive for a better world through my own awareness and activism.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Josh Thompson:

  >I am so glad you were on the team for this project - your willingness and skill to jump into problem, pry it out or whatever, was an enormous asset, and your calm, collected head in the face of any “problem” we ran into really helped me (and the team) keep things in perspective. One area you could work on in the future is finding a way to share what you learn/try independently with the group, even if just an overview of the rabbit hole and what did/didn’t work.


  >* For Stephanie Bentley:

  >You did a great job PM’ing this project, and it was a pleasure to work with you. I really appreciate the energy and resourcefulness you brought to the project - when we got stuck on something, your tenacity played a big role in getting us through. One thing you could focus on in the future is remaining calm in times of high stress.


  >* For Seth Moser:

  >I had a great  time working with you on this project. Our team was much better off having your quick problem-solving skills on board. I was especially impressed with your ability to apply concepts (from class, documentation, or wherever) to real-world problems. One thing you could focus on to be even more effective would be finding a way to more clearly communicate your thought-processes to everyone else in the group, walking through step by step.

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Maria Stenquist:

  >It was great working with you on Little Shop, you were an excellent teammate. I really appreciated how reliable you were with the work, and how much you offered assistance whenever possible. The only thing you might focus on in future projects is taking some initiative to try out your ideas - it is a difficult balance in a group project, but also perfectly acceptable to make a spike-branch to try things out, and I think that could have moved our styling and functional design along more quickly. Overall, your contributions across the project, and especially around styling, made the project much better than it would otherwise have been.


  >* For Danny Radden:

  >I had a great time working with you. Your quickness in picking up new concepts, as well as your existing depth and breadth of knowledge, enabled us to blaze through every challenge in front of us. Also, your dogged determination to solve problems was great - though at the same time, it was sometimes hard to know what your process was for tackling said problem. In sharing that process with the group, it can lead to a better outcome and more learning all around, even with the trade-off of potentially arriving at a solution more slowly. All around, I really appreciated your sense of humor and good nature, and assert you were a true asset to the team. 10/10 would work with again.


  >* For Sam Landfried:

  >I very much enjoyed and appreciated pairing with you - your methodical approach to TDD and your flexibility on the eventual solution was especially constructive, and you personally helped me see even more value in the TDD and pairing processes. We as a team benefitted from your logical mind, and your bringing creative solutions to the challenges of the project. The only area you might focus on in the future is setting boundaries on your time, both for your own benefit and that of the group. Your energy and concentration is a real asset, but can also be difficult for others to keep up with. Overall, I am really glad we finally had the chance to work together, and would hope to again in the future.

#### **Posse**
  >* I was loosely affiliated with the Wozniak posse this module. Generally, I attended weekly social lunches and Friday spikes.
  >* I enjoyed being exposed to some of the more brain-bending logical concepts of data structures.
  >* I now have a vision and list of topics for what I would like to know more about.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I signed up to pair with Mod 1 students right away - though I did not pair very often, I think it is important to give back, and especially meaningful to give back in a way that helped me so much. I plan to continue to do this in the future. I was also involved with the Imposters group, which I found very helpful in getting through my own times of self-doubt, and I also appreciated the chance to support others.
