# Jonathan Kidd - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to gain a basic (but thorough) understanding of the Ruby language, including syntax and object oriented programming. Additionally, I sought to learn how to break down technical challenges and conceptually grasp how to solve complex problems. Finally, I wanted to learn more about working with others, life in the tech world, and social issues that affect the industry and our world.

I made great strides toward meeting these goals over the course of the module. I went from near-zero knowledge of Ruby to a decent level of comfort in many core areas of Ruby and OOP. I greatly improved by capacity for breaking down and solving complex problems. In this, I learned about the importance of growth mindset and tenacity when dealing with such problems. I also learned a great deal about pair-programming and my strengths and areas for development as a team member. Finally, I learned and reflected about the tech industry and the most pressing social issues of our time.

## Self-Assessment Scores

| Category | Result (pass, fail, pending) |
| ----- | --- |
| Pairing Assessment | pass |
| Independent Timed Assessment | pass |
| Diagnostic | pass |

#### Assessor Comments

*   *Independent Timed Assessment* - "good clean and concise tests (good use of setup), could use some edge case testing, but otherwise solid, would have liked to see some effort towards i3, but i1 and i2 are really strong"
*   *Diagnostic* - "A few misses but overall, nice job."

#### Notes

*   Areas for future focus include bolstering tests (especially edge cases) and further breaking apart large methods and classes. Much of this solidified for me in the last 2 weeks of the module.
*   Functional expectations scores were less than satisfactory for the second and third project. I believe this has to do with two issues: time management and wanting to fully demonstrate my abilities in other assessment categories. I have taken steps to improve by time management issues by front-loading my work, which will allow me to get further in the projects, while still producing good quality work.

### Pair Feedback

*   Night Writer (Riley Thompson):

**From Riley:**
>You were very organized, and possessed a strong attention to detail. Took the initiative to schedule many different pairing sessions which were integral to the success of our project. You were fun to work with,  kept a serious, but also playful attitude even during frustrating stints, while remaining punctual and respecting my time.


**To Riley:**
>Had a great time working on this project with you. It seems like you have a knack for diving into complex problems, and somehow holding it all in your head at once. You were committed to the outcome while being good natured and easy to work with. I think we had a good flow when things were happening. In retrospect we may have stayed mired in problems for too long (1 + hour) before asking for help. I think asking for help or pairing sooner could have left us more time to polish in the end. I also think more time pseudo coding in a deeper way may have helped, rather than diving right into to problems. We did a good job planning big-picture solutions, but not much time mapping exactly how we would get there.

*   Black Thursday (Diana Whalen):

**From Diana:**
>Jonathan - Pairing with you on this project has been a learning experience for me. I am very grateful for the meticulous approach you brought to the table, and especially you being proactive in securing resources for us at each step of the project, from pairings, to study rooms, etcâ€¦ And continually running our tests throughout. This has been so helpful in not staying stuck on any roadblock too long and keeping us on schedule. Remembering to ask for assistance regularly is something I intend to emulate for future projects, paired or otherwise. In spite of our issues early on, I think we ended up making quick progress once we found our rhythm, especially when we took turns driving/navigating. More clarity as to intention on what you would like to try out or work on, as it changes from what we previously discussed would be helpful to stay on the same page and avoid miscommunication. Thank you for all your hard work on this project!

**To Diana:**

>Diana - I have learned so much working with you on this project. I really appreciate your tenacity and willingness and ability to put in long hours to understand the material and get the work done, and also being proactive in mapping out the relationships and pivoting the data to make sense of it all. The pseudocoding you did from going through the spec helped us break down the pieces when we were still trying to get our heads around the interaction model. Your explanation of your learning and work style helped me understand how best to approach the project as a team. I feel that our issues at the outset allowed us to tackle the project from different angles, and getting experience working with people who are different than us (and also very alike in some ways!). More clear communication on what you would like to divide up and conquer versus work through together would improve workflow. Thanks for your time and energy you devoted to this project.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
##### Growth Mindset
This was a great message, and central to success at Turing. I recognized I was raised more with a fixed mindset around academic endeavors (being labeled as "smart"), but with growth in other areas (music, language). Though I recognize the signs better, I am still triggered into a fixed mindset space at the beginning of a new endeavor or project. I have found this can be mitigated by dealing with the thought pattern immediately ("I don't know this YET"), getting started right away (even if I don't know which way to go), and relying on my cohort to share in the struggle, reminding me I am not alone.

#### Session 2
##### Getting Better at Difficult Things
I dove more into the learning experience and my own strengths and weaknesses therein. I have tried to apply the idea of limited cognitive resources to prioritize what I spend my time doing. I also seek to break down problems into smaller bits, which helps me stay in a growth mindset and have smaller wins through time, focused on what I can improve one bite at a time. I think review and recall is of paramount importance to solidify new material, as is taking breaks and getting enough sleep. Again, growth mindset is very important, so getting in that mode and staying there through the struggle helps the learning process.

#### Session 3
##### Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms
Unmanaged stress tends to manifest itself through attacks (self or others), and negative behaviors (avoidance or withdrawal). I tend to attack myself and practice avoidance behaviors (especially procrastination), though I also have an arsenal of healthy "off-ramps", or coping mechanisms: exercise, writing, meditating, and regular, healthy eating. To make sure I am able to take one of these "off-ramps," I need to frequently check in with myself, consciously check my stress level, and pre-empt any dangerous or damaging levels of stress.

#### Session 4
##### Personal Stories and Connections
It is not often we have a dedicated time to reflect on our most deeply held values, identities, and lenses and it is even more rare to discuss these values with others. I discovered that I look at the world most often through an analytical lens - which is great in some circumstances, but can also make my cynical. At the same time, though, I believe every individual is unique, coming from a separate experiences. I value curiosity and learning, loyalty and fun, and I plan to seek out and encourage these things both in my cohort and in future jobs and environments. I think it is important to know what other values, identities, and lenses others hold. By sincerely seeking to understand others and make a genuine connection, we can make our interactions, teamwork, and experiences as fulfilling as possible for everyone.

#### Session 5
##### Debugging the Gender Gap
This movie and discussion was a powerful and enriching experience. The movie touched on many issues we will come to face with in the tech industry - especially discrimination based on gender and minority-status. It called for us to re-examine our own implicit views and stereotypes, and work to right the wrongs in the actions we take and by speaking up. The discussion was informative, allowing me to reflect on my own challenges with staying aware of the imbalances and having the courage to speak up, even when it is not me or my identity being challenged. I think it is of paramount importance to remain open and affirming of everyone's experiences, and to truly seek out others' experiences to continue to grow as an empathetic person.

### Community Participation
I have tried my best to be involved with the Turing community whenever possible. I paired at least 3 times per week with students from other modules, and learned much about the course material and life at Turing, and had a chance to enjoy the company of people from all kinds of backgrounds. I look forward to the opportunity to help others through pairing as well. Though I did not have a home Posse, I attended a variety of Spike sessions where I was exposed to new ideas and helpful tools for life and Turing. I attended weekly meditation four of the six weeks, which helped me regulate stress and be a better member of my cohort and the school. I have also done my part with keeping our classroom and kitchen clean (generally cleaning on Thursdays).
