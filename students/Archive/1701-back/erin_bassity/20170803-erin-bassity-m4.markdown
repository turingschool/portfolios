# Erin Bassity - B4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

* This module I wanted to:
  - Get comfortable with the front-end
  - Learn React
  - Build an app with a Rails backend and React front end
  - Work on a solo project
  - Practice going through technical interviews
  
## Assessment

PASS

My biggest technical challenge on the assessment was using React (my choice) in a short timeframe and feeling the pressure of being timed in general. While I loved learning React, I didn’t like having to scramble to learn what I needed to learn to pass the assessment. To make it through, I referred to React documentation, followed several tutorials to help with pattern recognition, studied, and used trial and error. Through this experience, I learned more about React than I would have otherwise and feel more marketable as a developer as a result.

## Quantified Self

My biggest technical challenge during this project was working in a brand-new language. Even seemingly little tasks took hours due to our (partner project) inexperience with Javascript. I sought out other courses and tutorials on the subject in order to feel more comfortable with the new language in addition to working through the project. I really liked learning a new language and was pleasantly surprised by how much less difficult it felt than when I first learned Ruby—the initial experience of learning Ruby in module 1 seems to make subsequent languages a tad easier to learn. In addition to learning Javascript, I also became more comfortable with jQuery and AJAX, and learned to write ES6. I was grateful to have the support of a great partner on this project — working through it alone would have been maddening.

## Capstone Project

My biggest technical challenge on this project was implementing a React front end to my Rails back end. I also found it to be a challenge to keep the stories in my sprint in check. I was a bit too ambitious to start with, but learned quickly that it’s better to under promise and over deliver. I loved having a chance to work on something I’d been kicking around for several years. In addition to React, I honed my ES6 skills and used Travis CI for the first time. 

## Feedback

Once piece of feedback I received was to be more confident in my ability as a developer. I struggle with this constantly, but it’s getting easier to convince myself that I know as much as I do and can continue to develop my skills (growth mindset).

## Gear Up

I really enjoyed revising the resilience Gear Up with my co-leaders. At first I didn’t think we would have adequate time to prepare something great with the competing demands of our academic schedule, but we pulled together and did it. We were thoughtful about what we would present to students and only chose activities and materials we really liked. We spend time doing a dry run outside of the scheduled planning hours, which was quite helpful to the session being a success. Students were engaged throughout, which felt great.

## Community Involvement

This inning, I continued to participate in the Imposter’s Lunch, but stepped back as a leader so that two other students could co-lead. I also served as my cohorts SAB representative and helped plan the SAB bingo mixer as well as the end-of-module social gathering. I also participated in the Joan Clarke Society.

## Going Forward

The three most valuable skills I’ll take with me from my time at Turing are 1) test-driven development, 2) resilience/perserverence, and 3) collaborative programming (pairing).
