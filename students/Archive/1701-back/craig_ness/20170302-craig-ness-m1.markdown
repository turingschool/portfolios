### Assessor Comments

#### Comments on Night Writer from Lauren Fazah:
*   Aim for encapsulating all Ruby code in a class
*   Smaller, more SRP methods (efforts towards that are visible)
*   Less unnecessary variable declarations
*   Let tests drive major (and minor) refactors - this would eliminate issues we're seeing with old `to_braille` tests no longer supporting `ToBraille`
*   Would be nice to see edge cases tested

#### Comments on Black Thursday from Beth Sebian:
*   Style: If enumerables are blocks, use do/end, and no need to return values in find
*   Solid testing, comprehensive; nice use of fixtures
*   Enumerables otherwise solid
*   Solid breakdown of classes
*   Through i4

### Pair Feedback

#### Pair Project 1, Feedback for Craig (Project: Night Writer, Partner: Maria Stenquist)

Craig was super patient, always willing to try new things and hack away at trying to find a solution. Working together and struggling through solving problems went well. When we made "small gains" we made sure to acknowledge the other person's contributions towards it. Craig was really good at getting into the tiny details of the project, and I think that was super helpful when keeping track of a bunch of things in flux. I think we struck a good balance of using our resources (mentors, upper mod students, google), although on a few occasions we banged our heads against a concept for a bit too long. We did have some diminishing returns, and would have benefitted from taking more breaks and stepping away from the project for a bit and coming back with fresher eyes. I think we had some checks-and-balances in our pairing dynamic which was good to check small errors and getting small pieces of functionality working. When one person was starting to feel drained, I felt that the other stepped in to help relieve some of the (small) speed bumps we encountered. Nonetheless, we did get the spec functionality working in the end. I think we managed our time pretty well, and the extra hours spent white-boarding and framing the problem at the beginning were beneficial. Given a bit more time I think we would have really driven forward more refactoring and fixed our TDD process that we needed to revisit. Pair-dynamics: I think our driver-navigator setup was good. Our Github flow saved us time as our commits, pull requests, and merges went smoothly for this project. I really enjoyed working with Craig on this project!

#### Pair Project 2, Feedback for Craig (Project: Black Thursday, Partner: Seth Moser)

Good job getting your shit done and when falling behind going back and looking at how something worked, it was nice of you to tell me you weren't keeping up with my pace and doing more work after we split off, but just be sure to let me know earlier next time.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
Growing up, we tend to believe that our abilities are static, that our strengths are innate, and that we either have certain skills or we don’t. This mindset is known as a “fixed mindset” and is actually counter-productive to learning any new skill, including computer programming. What we ought to practice—and what should become habit here during our time at Turing—is “growth mindset.” Growth mindset is all about believing that you have the capacity to learn anything, given enough time and hard work. It’s about embracing the struggle of learning, and even more importantly, enjoying the journey above all else.


#### Session 2 - Getting Better at Difficult Things
Research has discovered that we all have a fixed amount of mental energy that we can tap into throughout the day, and that each activity that we perform depletes this resource. Known as “cognitive resources,” this concept is critical in understanding how best to learn new things. The more cognitive resources a process requires, the more important it is to master that skill so that we no longer have to spend energy working on it. This act of mastery can be performed quite rapidly, given the right approach. Dividing tasks into smaller chunks and then practicing these chunks with a lot of repetition quickly moves a skill from novice to mastery, thereby freeing up cognitive resources for more demanding challenges.


#### Session 3 - Managing Stress
Learning can be a difficult process, so it’s necessary to actively plan de-stressing activities into our day or week. Before we get too stressed out, we need to find our “off-ramp” by performing one of our coping mechanisms. For me, these mechanisms include playing music, watching TV, working out, going for a walk, talking with friends and family, and listening to podcasts, among others. If we habitualize these routines, they will start to become automatic and we can proactively deal with our stress in a healthy, constructive way.


#### Session 4 - Personal Stories and Connections
Although we all come from different backgrounds, we can find commonalities that will help us to build relationships between one another. Using this foundation, we can then work on identifying our differences, and actually utilize them to our advantage—the more we know about each other, the better we can communicate and empathize. In this way, we can navigate difficult issues that might arise when we are collaborating together.


#### Session 5 - Debugging the Gender Gap
It’s often difficult to put ourselves in someone else’s position and see the world through their eyes. After watching the documentary about the gender gap, I realized that women face many struggles working in the tech world, of which I was not aware and do not face. Not only are women culturally migrated away from STEM fields from an early age, but once there, they often face a bias that men just simply don’t have to deal with. Armed with this knowledge, we should try to become more inclusive of women and minority groups in tech so that we can all make better products. After all, building great products means that the people making them should look like the people using them.


### Community Participation
One of the first things that I noticed about Turing walking through the door on day one was the strong sense of community not only amongst my own cohort, but throughout the entire school. In fact, this community aspect was one of the main reasons I chose to come here. I’ve enjoyed the tremendous amount of collaboration and support from students, instructors, alumni, and mentors, and have tried to pay it forward with every opportunity that comes my way. Not only does it help me to solidify concepts by walking others through some code, but it also feels extremely gratifying and rewarding. I’ve enjoyed pairing with others, or coming in on weekends to get help from a mentor. I’ve attended Friday evening practice sessions to go over drills, Friday morning guest speaker sessions (which I have found to be extremely valuable), spikes, lunch roulette get-togethers, and posse meetings. I even enjoyed giving my Lightning talk to the class and presenting information on a topic that a lot of people might not have known about (even though it was mandatory and public speaking isn’t my best strength). With the start of Module 2 and throughout the rest of my time here, I hope to be able to help others the way I have been helped by paying it forward. The community here really is one of the best aspects of the school, and I plan on making the most of it during my time at Turing.
