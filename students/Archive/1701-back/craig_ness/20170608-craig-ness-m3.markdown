# Craig Ness - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Over the course of this module, I wanted to focus on APIs--building my own internal endpoints, as well as consuming external endpoints.

* This module really forced me to try things on my own, struggle with concepts, and seek out answers to problems that I had never encountered before. Along with the core curriculum of the module and learning about APIs, the thing that I learned the most this inning was a certain self-reliance to figure things out on my own and to embrace the struggle of learning difficult things.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

**[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
* This individual project revolved around consuming an external API service--the GitHub API. By making calls to certain endpoints, I was able to recreate some of the functionality of GitHub's website.
* This project was a struggle for almost the entire week that I worked on it. Conceptually, there were so many new things introduced that I had a hard time tying it all together. However, by embracing the learning experience, I was able to fully comprehend how to consume API endpoints by the end of the week.


## B: Group Work & Projects

**[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
* During this pair project, my partner and I were tasked with building internal API endpoints thought offered up sales data and business analytics. The analytics were created using advanced ActiveRecord and SQL queries to our database.
* This project taught me how to build my own API and test it. More importantly, it gave me a better grasp of the Agile process and the importance of delivering a product to a client, and how to prioritize tasks.

**[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/prompts/thumbtack)**
>* During the first sprint of Cloney Island, our group was tasked with re-creating the Thumbtack website (which we named "CorkBoard"). These first two weeks consisted mostly of building out the back-end of the site, setting up our database tables and associations. My individual user story was to implement a real-time webchat feature that would allow a professional and a customer to message one another using WebSockets, ActionCable, and Redis.
>* Our back-end turned out to be much more complicated than we first anticipated, so I was able to get some practice with these advanced concepts. Also, I was introduced to the idea of WebSockets as an alternative to the typical stateless HTTP request/response cycle.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/prompts/kickstarter)**
>* During the second sprint of Cloney Island, our groups and projects were shuffled around to replicated a true "brownfield" project--one in which we are inheriting a pre-existing codebase, instead of one that we created from scratch. This offered unique challenges as we continued to build upon the work that had been completed previously. A clone of the Kickstarter site, Puntstartr replicates a lot of the same features that you would expect to see on the original crowdfunding website. My individual user story involved using AJAX calls to add comments to a project page without reloading, displaying only those comments associated with the project you are currently viewing, and updating a count of the comments using AJAX and jQuery.
>* I gained exposure to front-end tools and concepts such as javascript, jQuery, and AJAX calls. I also used Selenium to test my feature, and got some more practice testing internal API endpoint requests, model tests, and feature tests.

## C. **Gear Ups**

[Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

* Microagressions are small statements of subtle discrimination that often go unnoticed by the person who said it. They can make others feel marginalized and often serve to reinforce stereotypes. I learned that even though they often see harmless, microaggressions can add up and we should try to be more aware of our language.

[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

* During this session I learned how small-scale personal thoughts and actions can sometimes carry over and have an impact on large-scale systems. We should try to counter-act these trends by eliminating bias wherever and whenever we see it. Often our bias is unconscious, but hopefully by talking about it we can become aware of our thoughts and actions on a conscious level.

[Choose your own adventure: Privacy](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

* During this session we were asked to think about the fallout of the Snowden leaks, and what we would do in this situation. We discussed the fact that some security and secrecy is always necessary in a sovereign state, but having a tool as powerful as the one that the NSA currently wields can often turn the government against its own people. This question has no right answer, but I believe we as a society should lean towards privacy over security whenever we can.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* [Blog Post](https://gist.github.com/NessEFC/59310407e0f0cfaa94e862a560c1ee9a)

#### **Posse**
* During the Wozniak posse meetings, we were able to practice technical interview questions, and talking about our code.
* I enjoyed having time each week to focus on solving challenging logic problems.
* The posse experience helped me to prepare for technical interview challenges, as well as the process of thinking through and talking about my code before, during, and after I write it.

#### **Playing a Part**

This was a tough module overall, and as such I was not able to contribute as much as I'd hoped. Nevertheless, I was always available to answer questions from cohort members or Turing students in general. I was involved in the Wozniak posse and regularly attended meetings such as Tuesdays with Toni, talks hosted by Ian Douglas, posse meetings, spikes, and lunch roulette Fridays, among others.
