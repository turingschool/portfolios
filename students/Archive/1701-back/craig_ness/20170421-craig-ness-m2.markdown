# Craig Ness - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module I wanted to begin to develop a foundational knowledge of web application frameworks, understanding their architecture and layout. I wanted to begin to understand Rails and some of its powerful capabilities, and build out some basic web applications that were capable of functioning like a professional website. In addition, I had an interest in developing some styling skills using html and css, and understanding the impact that a well-designed website can have on a user's experience.

* This module had a lot of self-guided curriculum, which I found to be particularly suited to my learning style. Because I like to work at my own pace and really dive-in to specific topics that might come up during my project work time, I enjoyed being able to go work through multiple iterations of an individual project and have that kind of flexibility. We were also able to get a lot of repetition in through these individual assignments, which was crucial in trying to internalize the architecture of a Rails web application.

* The three things I would like to work on going forward are: confidence in my coding abilities, being able to work under pressure and time constraints, and collaborating effectively during assessments. All three of these skills directly lend themselves to performing well during technical interviews, which are crucial for landing any software development job.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
 [The CSS Position Property](https://gist.github.com/NessEFC/3651c56e2887e370f1ad39e34939d913)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
 Both Blogger and Mix Master were great opportunities to really dive into the basics of Rails on my own, and learn through repetition. There's so many little details to remember when using Rails that I often would have to reference these tutorials later on to see how I accomplished something previously.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
 Job tracker was great to work on because it wasn't a guided tutorial. As such, I really tried to test myself without referencing outside resources (such as Blogger or Mix Master), which helped to solidify concepts as I worked through it. The Mini Project was fun, though I didn't get as far along in it as I had originally hoped to. I faced a postgres database error during the weekend we were given to work on it, and it took me a while to figure out how to fix it. The time lost there set me back, although I was still able to work on CRUD functionality and get even more repetition with Rails.


## C: Group Work & Projects

 **Bike Share**
* For this project, we were tasked with building a web application using Sinatra that analyzes bike share usage.
* There was a heavy emphasis on ActiveRecord methods, though we ended up using Ruby methods to support these functions. I was also in charge of styling for our site, so I got to dive into a lot of html and css, which was great. Also, having a group of three people meant that I was exposed to a more advanced Git workflow.

 **Little Shop of Orders**
* For this project, our group built an e-commerce site dedicated to Turing getaway experiences for intermission weeks. We called it "Turing Escapes", and it allowed us to build an almost fully-functional production site using Rails and Heroku.
* As team manager for this project, I got to practice my leadership and organizational skills using an Agile workflow. As expected, this project helped to reinforce our Rails fundamentals, as well as exposing us to the asset pipeline.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

   From Nick Jacques (Team Manager):
  * Craig you were a great asset to our team on the Bike Share Project. You showed a really strong work ethic and were always willing to put in the time and effort to make sure our project got done. I think we all agreed after the project's completion that we really enjoyed our group dynamic and that we were all proud of what we had been able to accomplish. At the beginning of the project you somewhat hesitantly volunteered to lead the effort on styling. Despite your reservations and inexperience with styling you put together a site that Andrew described as the best looking of any that he has evaluated. My only regret about your role in our group is that because you took the lead on styling you did not get to participate as heavily in the other aspects of the project that Colleen and I spent a lot of time pairing on.


   From Colleen Ward:
  * Craig, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I think our group worked well together and created a great project. Your willingness to take on all of the css/styling was a huge undertaking and I think you did an outstanding job! The project looked great. I appreciated your work style - pausing Nick and I if we were moving to quickly and asking questions. I also really appreciated when you would suggest that we take a break - I can sometimes forget to do that so it was really helpful to walk away from the project when we were stuck! I thought our group dynamic was great - a good balance of working hard, but not getting too stressed and still having fun and you definitely helped create that dynamic! Overall I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of the work we did together. Thanks for being an awesome group partner!


##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

   From Beth Knight:
  * Craig is really fun to work with. We had to do long hours for this project and he was always cheerful and ready to work. He drove and navigated. He was our project manager and made sure to keep us on track and do stand ups every day.


   From Colleen Ward:
  * Craig, I really enjoyed working with you again on our Little Shop project. I think you were a great project manager and appreciate you taking on that role in our group. You’re always calm and methodical, which I think brought a good balance to the group. Your rails and active record knowledge really helped the group deliver a great project. Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.


   From Sergey Lukyanenko:
  * It’s been a pleasure to have Craig in our team as project manager. He is dedicated and hardworking person. Craig is able to identify and use resources very effectively. He is always willing to help others. He is a great teammate in every sense.


## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
 [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/craig_ness.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

[Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown):
* Empathy is crucial while collaborating with teammates. In order to better empathize with the people around us, it's necessary to examine how privilege and marginalization impact how we view the world and our relationships to others. Through this process of identifying our own privileges, we can better understand where people are coming from and thereby relate to them better.


 [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
* Grit is a valuable asset to have when working on anything throughout life. It's often mischaracterized as just "perseverance", but there's another equally important aspect that is often overlooked--passion. It's not enough to just work hard at something, it should be something worth working hard for. Otherwise, that's just drudgery.


 [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
* If history is any guide, automation will continue to creep into all sectors of the economy. If we don't actively work to adapt to this new environment, society could possibly be faced with mass unemployment. As the potential creators of automation products, we should be aware of the impact we could have on displaced workers throughout the economy.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

   For Nick Jacques (Team Manager):
  * Nick, you were an awesome partner and I really enjoyed working with you throughout the entire Bike Share project. I thought you were extremely knowledgable in all aspects of the project, and I appreciated your calm demeanor and willingness to put in long hours to get all of the iterations completed. I was particularly impressed with your ability to utilize Ruby/ActiveRecord methods, as well as your team management skills. You were also able to reach out to someone for help when our team was stuck, allowing us to move forward, which was crucial. I think it was evident how well our team worked together, and we never had any real issues or conflicts. If I ever have the chance to work with you again, I’d welcome the opportunity. Good luck in mod 3!


   For Colleen Ward:
  * Colleen, you were a fantastic partner throughout the entire Bike Share project. I think it was pretty evident to all of us in the group how well we worked together, so having the chance to work with you a second time in the same mod was great. I was really impressed with your ability to work out a lot of the more complex Ruby/ActiveRecord methods—so much so that I was always confident that you’d help us get “unstuck” if we ever hit a challenging roadblock. It was awesome to be able to have that kind of confidence in a team member. I was also impressed with your work ethic and willingness to put in long hours for such a grueling project. Thanks for a great group project experience, and good luck in the next mod!


##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

   For Beth Knight:
  * Beth, it was great to finally have a chance to work with you after not having the opportunity for most of the first mod. I was really impressed with your work ethic, and you were always willing and able to try out new ideas. Having that kind of team member who can generate solutions in a group is really valuable when we’re stuck and trying to come up with new ways to attack a problem. You were also always willing to drive, and your positive demeanor helped to make the long hours in the basement enjoyable. Thanks for the great group project experience, and good luck in the next mod!


   For Colleen Ward:
  * Colleen, when I first saw that we would be working together again on a group project, I knew that the experience was going to be a positive one yet again. Your knowledge of Rails combined with Ruby and ActiveRecord meant that our group was able to work through some tough challenges. I was impressed when we would break for the evening and re-group the next day, only to discover that you had experimented on your own time at home and found a solution to our problem from the day before. Your ability to work through technical challenges and seek out answers online when we were stuck was a huge asset to the group as well. Overall, I think you’re a great addition to any team you might find yourself working on in the future. Thanks for another great group project experience!


   For Sergey Lukyanenko:
  * Sergey, I really enjoyed our time working together on our final group project of mod 2. I was truly impressed by your willingness to tackle new challenges like css styling, and volunteering to take the lead while coding together. Your calm demeanor helped our group to remain cohesive and your positivity helped to make the project enjoyable to work on. Having a team member like that really helps to make the group function better as a whole, and I appreciated the fact that you were rarely frustrated. I was also impressed by your ability to focus in on the details of the code—you always seemed to be able to spot the parts of our code that would throw an error before any of us could, and you were great at coming up with solutions to solve them. Overall I really enjoyed having you as a partner, and would welcome the opportunity to work with you again. Good luck in the next mod!


#### **Posse**
  * As a member of the Wozniak posse, I attended all but one of the posse meetings. I had a great timing learning about computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data types, and Big O notation.
  * My favorite part of Wozniak is getting to learn some valuable computer science fundamentals that are important for technical interview questions.
  * I've learned about linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, queues, stacks, Big O notation, and so much more. Exposure to these concepts now will pay off in the future, and I've enjoyed learning how to code them along the way.

#### **Playing a Part**

 I've attended Wozniak posse and enjoy being a member, providing feedback to the student instructors every week. I've attended guest speaker talks, went to demo night to support Turing students and grads, and attended lunch roulette every week. It's been great having the opportunity to meet students from other cohorts, especially from the front-end side. I now know who to reach out to with styling or javascript questions in the future, and I've offered my support to them when dealing with any back-end questions. Because people are so generous with their time here and willing to help, I've tried to pay these favors forward, which I feel is all a part of the Turing philosophy here. I look forward to continuing this process, and seeking out new ways to contribute to the community.
