# Colleen Ward - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Module 1 I hoped to gain a strong understanding of ruby fundamentals, logic and object oriented programming, and learn to pair program. I also hoped I would begin to build great relationships with my fellow classmates. I think overall I accomplished all of these things and more. On top of the things listed above I also feel I have a solid foundation around test-driven development, HTTP requests and Git.

| ----- | --- |
| Pairing Assessment | pass |
| Independent Timed Assessment | pass |
| Diagnostic | pass |

#### Assessor Comments

*   Written Diagnostic (from Lauren): Great work here! A few teeny misses, but very impressive overall.
*   Independent Assessment (from Beth): Beautiful  enums, Ruby style rock solid, Nailed i3, For some of these tests (`test_it_knows_characters`), you can have an assertion that references the objects you created in setup. For example: `assert_equal [kitt, michael_knight, devon_miles], kr.characters`. That allows you to fully verify results in one assertion. In character_test, you can get away with just using one object to test against. Two assertions in each test is redundant here. If there are exceptions you're trying to catch by using two, that should be a new test whose name highlights the exception. Git solid, no 20 min commits

#### Notes

*   Night Writer - From Beth: Really strong testing of braille-to-english and english-to-braille. Would like to see more testing of edge cases.A couple long methods, but overall Ruby style is solid. Shows nice effort toward refactoring.In future, look to pull some shared functionality into separate classes or modules.
*   Black Thursday - From Ilana: Great breakdown of classes and creation of modules, Created charts with JS, Talked about more robust testing, Talked about small use of instance variables instead of methods


## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects

#### Project 1 (Yohanan Assefa):

>It was great working with you on night writer, Colleen. You were committed to getting the project done and brought a strong understanding of Ruby. It was helpful to observe you test out different approaches/methods, consistently use pry, and not get easily frustrated when we hit roadblocks. I appreciate your willingness to go slow and explain various concepts/methods to me when I had a hard time figuring out different aspects of the project. I’m very glad I got to pair with you and I’ve learned a lot from this experience. I have no doubt that your strong grasp of programming and ability to feel/show empathy and kindness towards others will make you an outstanding developer.


#### Project 2 (Victoria Vasys):

>It was a real pleasure working with you! The fact that you were so willing to put every last minute of your free time into this project was highly motivating and put us in a great spot to finish, while leaving a whole day of refactoring! That felt really good. Obviously, we all have plenty of room for improvement considering we have 3 mods to go, but I think you might really benefit from celebrating your charts & pops a little more. I honestly don't have any negative feedback! I think we were good about switching roles, picking up each other's slack when we were brain-dead & dividing and conquering. Thanks for being willing to go down wonky roads with me & taking time to problem-solve on your own when we got stuck working together. Super duper job, I'm really happy with our progress!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
I really enjoyed the Gear Up session on growth mindset. I had never heard of growth/fixed mindset and it immediately made an impact on me. Having a growth mindset is essential to attending Turing and learning new things in general. If you have a fixed mindset, then you don’t think you can learn new things. Learning about growth mindset and thinking about past experiences and what held me back from having a growth mindset, really made me think about ways I can avoid that while attending Turing, including focusing on small successes I have made, talking to others that may also be “stuck” on a project or asking questions when I don’t understand something.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
The Gear Up session on getting better at difficult things introduced me to another new concept - cognitive load. I found it very fascinating about how increased cognitive load can impact your ability to handle stress and learning new things. I also really liked the idea that Kathy Sierra presented about the three things that take up cognitive resources- the things we can’t do but need to learn, things we can do, but with effort, and then the things we have “mastered” and don’t need to think about much. Her ideas on how to reduce cognitive resources and move things from a to c, really helped me think of the things we have been learning in new ways and how I can approach new learnings.

#### Session 3: Managing Stress
The Gear Up session on managing stress could not have come at a better time for me. I was starting to really feel stressed with just finishing up our first pair project, the mid mod diagnostic coming up and the HTTP project just assigned that I really had no idea where to start on. It gave me the space to really think about ways that help me de-stress and remind myself to try and do those things when I start to feel overwhelmed. They asked us to write down an action plan of sorts so that when we identify that we are stressed, we can do some of those things to “off ramp” before we get to a level 10 stress. I even did some of them the following weekend and that helped a lot!

#### Session 4: Personal Stories & Connection
During this Gear Up session we answered questions about why we chose to attend Turing, what lenses we view the world through, what values drive us and if others could identify our values from our actions. Through answering these questions for myself, I realized that the reasons I decided to attend Turing overlap a lot with many of my values - inclusiveness, personal growth/learning, creativity and honesty. Turing's focus on building a diverse community, their openness to share graduation/job data, their non-profit status (not focused on solely making money) attracted me to the program. Also, thinking about what lenses I see the world through and talking about this with our small groups reminded me while we have similarities, we all have different backgrounds/experiences that influence how we see and experience the world and this program. This is something we (our cohort) should keep in mind and I think we do a good job of being open to other points of view.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
This was the second time I've watched this film, and watching it this time while attending Turing gave a new perspective to it. I enjoy this film because it shines a light on a big problem in tech and as a woman, knowing that going into looking for a job (in a few months) I think will help it not be a shock if I join a team of all or mostly men. I appreciate that Turing shows this film to all students- and that we had a really great discussion after in small groups. Our small group was 2 men and 2 women and it was really interesting for me as a woman to share my past experiences and how I related to the film and then also hear how to the two men related/what they thought of it. I think it will help all in our cohort be more sensitive/aware of the reality women face in the tech world and hopefully allow us the opportunity to be part of the solution for making it better.

### Community Participation
This mod I participated in the Turing community in a couple of ways. First, I think I added to the moral in our cohort and focused on being a good member of our cohort - providing help if I could, asking questions, and getting to know my classmates. I also participated in the Joan Clark Society, attending the speakers and the coffee events. I found these events very informative and really value the group of women who attend these meetings. Lastly, I attended a couple of Pahlka Posse spikes. I hope in future mods I can get more involved in this group and contribute to projects they are working on.
