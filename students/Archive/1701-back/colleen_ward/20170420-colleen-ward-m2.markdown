# Colleen Ward - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> During Mod 2 I hoped to gain an understanding of Rails, ActiveRecord and how to interact with/set up databases. I think I successfully achieved these expectations and more. I have a better understanding on how the web and various apps work, how an e-commerce site works, and feature testing with capybara.

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | Pass |
| **Written Diagnostic** | Pass |

>* The pairing assessment was a challenge for me since I had already implemented tags on my Job Tracker Beth pushed me to implement some more complex aspects of tagging, but I think I did OK and enjoyed trying something challenging.



## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Reading from CSV](https://caward12.github.io/csv.html)

> [Don't Cry; Pry](https://caward12.github.io/pry.html)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> Blogger: I really enjoyed the blogger tutorial. It was a super practical application for me (I had a food blog for about a year) so it was easy for me to relate to the different parts - an article with categories and tags and comments and now I understand some of the things that go into making platforms like Wordpress so user friendly for non-software developers! I also thought it was a good exposure to many to many relationships.

> Mix Master: Mix master was a great tutorial that I think gave us a really good sense of all the parts of rails - from the MVC to routes to testing, Oauth and users and even pushing to Heroku. It is definitely a tutorial I refer back to on a regular basis.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> I think Job Tracker was my favorite of the individual projects/tutorials this mod. There were many opportunities to take what we had learned, and apply it, and even expand on it. It was an approachable topic that was easy to understand the relationships and allowed us to work again with many to many and one to many relationships and nested routes.

>For my Rails Mini Project, I worked with the group on the Wellness Tracker - rebuilding the current wellness challenge spreadsheet into an app. This was a great exposure to working on a project that didn't have a spec for us, instead one that we were able to define for our MVP. It also presented some really interested challenges with admin access and trying to develop forms that make it as easy as possible for the user, but still had the functionality required for the models/database.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.
>* I enjoyed the Bike Share project for multiple reasons. First it was our first project where we could actually see the work we did, not just in the terminal. I also enjoyed it because it was a real-world set of data and it was our first exposure to working with a database.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* In this project you’ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.
>* Little Shop was a fun project. I enjoyed that we had some freedom in the project to choose what we were selling and add our own touches. I also think it was a valuable project implementing an e-commerce site - which many of us many one day work on in our professional life.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Nicholas Jacques: Colleen, I really enjoyed working with you on this project.  I'm really proud of the projects final outcome and you were a major contributor to its success. You have a strong commitment to using TDD which helped keep our project on track from start to finish.  I probably would have given up on TDD numerous times throughout this project if it wasn't for your patience and commitment to doing it the right way. You displayed a lot of grit and stamina in putting in long hours to make sure the project got done. It seemed like I had to take two breaks for each one of yours. As you probably noticed I can get distracted pretty easily but on this project I felt like you helped to maintain the group's focus and make sure we never fell significantly behind. Overall I think this was one of the best  groups that I have ever worked with and I hope we get another chance to work together before the end of the program.


  >* From Craig Ness: Colleen, you were a fantastic partner throughout the entire Bike Share project. I think it was pretty evident to all of us in the group how well we worked together, so having the chance to work with you a second time in the same mod was great. I was really impressed with your ability to work out a lot of the more complex Ruby/ActiveRecord methods—so much so that I was always confident that you’d help us get “unstuck” if we ever hit a challenging roadblock. It was awesome to be able to have that kind of confidence in a team member. I was also impressed with your work ethic and willingness to put in long hours for such a grueling project. Thanks for a great group project experience, and good luck in the next mod!


##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Beth Knight: Colleen is an amazing programmer and she kept our group on track. She stayed late and worked all weekend. She even brought jelly beans when we had to work all day on Easter. Awesome teammate.


  >* From Craig Ness: Colleen, when I first saw that we would be working together again on a group project, I knew that the experience was going to be a positive one yet again. Your knowledge of Rails combined with Ruby and ActiveRecord meant that our group was able to work through some tough challenges. I was impressed when we would break for the evening and re-group the next day, only to discover that you had experimented on your own time at home and found a solution to our problem from the day before. Your ability to work through technical challenges and seek out answers online when we were stuck was a huge asset to the group as well. Overall, I think you’re a great addition to any team you might find yourself working on in the future. Thanks for another great group project experience!


  >* From Sergey Lukyanenko:  It’s been a great experience working with Colleen on this project. She has a profound knowledge in Ruby on Rails. Her experience and hard work made a great input into the project. She is communicative and collaborative. Colleen has been an incredible asset to the team.


## D: Professional Skills


#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/colleen_ward.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
The gear up on empathy was helpful in reminding us that everyone comes from different experiences and backgrounds. It helped reinforce the idea that people may approach problems/situations/learning in different ways because of their past experiences and/or the different lenses through which they see the world. I also thought it was a good exercise to do in small groups so people felt a little more comfortable talking about topics they may not usually feel comfortable discussing.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
The gear up on grit was interesting. In the group/room I was in, the opinion on grit varied widely - some saying it was made up and some whole-heartedly believing. I think grit is something people can have and that many of us at Turing do have it  - we put in long hours to learn this new thing that we may not be very good at in the beginning but most of us stick with it.

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
Before this gear up, I had never really thought about how much in the world is being automated or thought about what the world will be like in 20-30 years. The fact that some of us at Turing may be the ones contributing to things becoming more and more automated is an interesting issue. In our group we talked a lot about just because we can automate something, doesn't necessarily mean that we should and what roles/jobs will always need a human to perform rather than a machine.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Nicholas Jacques: Nick, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I think our group worked well together and created a great project. Your willingness to take on the roll of project manager, something you said was out of your comfort zone, was awesome and I think you did an excellent job taking that on, setting up the Github, waffle board etc. I think you set a great tone for our group - not letting us get too stressed or frustrated and still have fun! I really appreciated your ability to explain some of the more complex methods/parts of the project when I wasn’t quite sure what the next step was. I also think your grit or drive to figure something out really helped our project be a success! Overall I think you were a great partner and project manager and I’m really proud of the work we did together.


  >* For Craig Ness: Craig, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I think our group worked well together and created a great project. Your willingness to take on all of the css/styling was a huge undertaking and I think you did an outstanding job! The project looked great. I appreciated your work style - pausing Nick and I if we were moving to quickly and asking questions. I also really appreciated when you would suggest that we take a break - I can sometimes forget to do that so it was really helpful to walk away from the project when we were stuck! I thought our group dynamic was great - a good balance of working hard, but not getting too stressed and still having fun and you definitely helped create that dynamic! Overall I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of the work we did together.


##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Beth Knight: Beth, I really enjoyed working with you on our Little Shop project. You have a great understanding of rails and working through errors. I appreciate your willingness to try anything when things weren’t working as we expected and to ask for help from your mentors.   I think this was really beneficial to our project! Your energy and positivity was a huge asset to our success and to keep us all smiling! I also think your CSS skills are awesome and really helped to take our project to the next level. Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.


  >* For Craig Ness: Craig, I really enjoyed working with you again on our Little Shop project. I think you were a great project manager and appreciate you taking on that role in our group. You’re always calm and methodical, which I think brought a good balance to the group. Your rails and active record knowledge really helped the group deliver a great project. Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.


  >* For Sergey Lukyanenko: Sergey, I really enjoyed working with you on our Little Shop project. You have a excellent understanding of rails that really showed in this project. Your CSS skills were also phenomenal, and I personally really appreciated how much you took on related to styling. I also really enjoyed your sense of humor and I thought it added to our group dynamic! Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.

#### **Posse**
  >* This mod, I worked with the Hamilton Posse on building a Wellness tracker app. This has been a great experience so far - working with a group towards a real-world application and also working with front-end and how do we combine both our experiences to deliver a great app.
  >* I think my favorite thing about the Hamilton posse this mod was that we are working across front-end and back-end and getting hands-on experience on how that relationship works.
  >* This posse experience has definitely helped me grow professionally through being part of another team. I also think it helped because we got to set out our own spec in a sense and define what the MVP would be - which was a new challenge for me.

#### **Playing a Part**

> In addition to joining the Hamilton posse, I also tried to attend Joan Clark meetings as often as I could. I also paired with Mod 1 students about once a week.
