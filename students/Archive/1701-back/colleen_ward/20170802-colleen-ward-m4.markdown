# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

This inning I wanted to focus on learning javascript/react/jQuery and then applying those learnings in projects. I also wanted to work on job-search/interview-prep.

## Assessment

PASS

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - flash messages and getting jQuery to do what I wanted with rails. Rails Challenge and this final were the first times I dealt with passing data between javascript/jQuery and rails controllers. It was definitely a challenge. Flash messages were also a challenge because of this - not exactly sure how the data was coming back from the ajax call to a non-api controller.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - I think I had to stretch my rails knowledge to rethink about how javascript and rails controllers interact.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - I did a lot of debugger-ing and pry-ing to step through the process in development. It was hard to use TDD well because I wasn't sure what kind of data I was going to get back.


* What did you learn?
  - All the things. How to get javascript and rails to be friends. Building a single page app in rails. How to get two applications to interact with each other based on a single action.

## Quantified Self


* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - jQuery and working with the asynchronous nature of javascript. There were a lot of tasks that were supposed to happen without refreshes and so getting the different jQuery functions to work in conjunction with each other was hard.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - We learned to work with promises `(then())` and also did a lot of experimenting on where different functions needed to be invoked in order to manipulate the DOM the way we wanted.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - I liked learning how to build a backend in javascript (I would still prefer to build it in Ruby/Rails but it was interesting learning how to do it in another language). I also enjoyed the front-end portion, as frustrating as it was, it was really satisfying to actually see the thing you built work.


* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - Building a database in node/express, connecting a front-end to a back-end (two separate code bases), and writing object-oriented javascript.


* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  - I think I would have tried to make our javascript more object-oriented. We ended up having a lot of floating functions in our index.js file that I think we probably could have added to a "class".


* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  - It was really interesting to see our different approaches. I think we ended up working well together, but we definitely approached learning the new thing different.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - Learning React while working on a new project and incorporating it into rails. Specifically state - learning about state and how to pass it around (or how not to) was definitely a challenge. I would also say building a multi-resource form for recipes with many ingredients and many categories was a challenge.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - I used a lot of tutorials that were similar (but not exactly) to what I was trying to do with my react components. I tried to go step-by-step and test in the browser that nothing was broken before moving on. I also tried to apply OOP principles I know from Ruby and Rails.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - Learning React was actually pretty fun. React turns the front-end in to much more object-oriented than just vanilla javascript or jQuery so I understood the concept better than I thought I would.


* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - State in react components and one-way data transfer
  - multi-resource and multi-step forms
  - Building a rails api to talk to a rails/react front-end


## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
- "you are an excellent person to pair with or work through a problem with"
  - I am going to keep this in mind when I feel like maybe I'm unsure of my own abilities and remember that I am good at pairing with someone and working on problems together.


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
- I enjoyed the process of developing a gear up session. It was challenging to get all group members on the same page, especially day-of. I think the topic of fake new is really interesting but can be very broad so it was difficult to narrow it down to something we could cover in an hour. I think most of the participants enjoyed the discussion we ended up having and that was rewarding.


## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
- I attended the Joan Clarke meetup to help think through what the group will look like moving forward, both in the Turing community and broader.
- Myself and Stephanie became very involved in the WomenRising/Equality Hackers group. We hosted a meetup for them here at Turing and invited other Turing women to join.
- I think this is required because it helps people connect and meet people in the community they might not otherwise meet.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
- TDD
- Pair programming
- resiliency/grit - Turing has been the hardest thing I've ever done and I survived.
