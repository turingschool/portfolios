# Nicholas Jacques - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> In Module 2 I wanted to continue to build upon the progress I had made towards this end of module 1. I especially wanted to work on using TDD. I believe I did a pretty good job of focusing on testing throughout module 2 and I feel much more comfortable with it now. Going into mod 3 I want to shift my focus to algorithms and technical interview prep.

| **Pairing Assessment** | Pass |
| **Written Diagnostic** | Pass |

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Setting up a new Rails Project](https://gist.github.com/NicholasJacques/6bf2a7733055844e6b5e6a73025726bc)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> These tutorials were highly guided which was a big change from mod 1 where we were basically left to figure things out on our own. I had mixed feelings about this change. On one hand it was nice to have those tutorials as a resource to use in the future but on the other hand it was harder to stay engaged when I didn't have to do a whole lot of deep thinking to complete them.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> I probably bit off a little more than I could chew for one weekend of work on my rails mini project but it I ended up learning a lot of things from it that I was able to to use in our little shop project. I enjoyed the process of building something from scratch without much guidance and having to find solutions to problems unique to my project. I thought this project was valuable in furthering my understanding of rails.

## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* This project asked us to build a sinatra app that allowed users to interact with and analyze bike share data from the City of San Fransisco.
>* I really enjoyed this project. I was lucky enough to have a really good group that worked well together and was always on the same page. I wish we had been able to dive deeper into advanced activerecord usage but other than that I was really happy with how the project turned out.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* In this project we were tasked with building out a simple ecommerce platform that utilized rails' sessions to build a shopping cart without saving items to the database.
>* One day, I will recieve a 4 on testing and it will be glorious.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* Feedback from Colleen Ward:

  Nick, I really enjoyed working with you on Bike Share. I think our group worked well together and created a great project. Your willingness to take on the roll of project manager, something you said was out of your comfort zone, was awesome and I think you did an excellent job taking that on, setting up the Github, waffle board etc. I think you set a great tone for our group - not letting us get too stressed or frustrated and still have fun! I really appreciated your ability to explain some of the more complex methods/parts of the project when I wasn’t quite sure what the next step was. I also think your grit or drive to figure something out really helped our project be a success! Overall I think you were a great partner and project manager and I’m really proud of the work we did together. Thanks for being such a great group partner - i think this was my favorite group/partner project!

  >* Feedback from Craig Ness:

  Nick, you were an awesome partner and I really enjoyed working with you throughout the entire Bike Share project. I thought you were extremely knowledgable in all aspects of the project, and I appreciated your calm demeanor and willingness to put in long hours to get all of the iterations completed. I was particularly impressed with your ability to utilize Ruby/ActiveRecord methods, as well as your team management skills. You were also able to reach out to someone for help when our team was stuck, allowing us to move forward, which was crucial. I think it was evident how well our team worked together, and we never had any real issues or conflicts. If I ever have the chance to work with you again, I’d welcome the opportunity. Good luck in mod 3!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Riley Thompson

  Collaborating with Nick has been a great experience throughout the course of the Little Shop project. I really appreciated his willingess to help me become more familiar with FactoryGirl, which served to be an invaluable resource in our project that streamlined our testing work flow. Along with being knowledgeable, Nick also has a great work ethic that comes with a positive attitude. He was willing to come in both days on the weekend to ensure that we were at a good place in our user stories. Overall, I would recommend Nick as a teammate to anyone because I know he would be a valued contributor in any setting.

  >* From Mark Van Akkeren:

  For Nick: I grossly underestimated where you were at with the material when we kicked this off. Didn't take long to figure out my mistake.  Looking at your mini project alone blew me away.  I appreciate both of you having the patience to let me drive the first week and to allow me to solidify my understanding of the more rudimentary concepts and connections within RAILS. I'm not sure _where_ we could have put it in this project (what with the successive, seemingly sequential, user stories) but a group work technique that I've found to help when teams are made up of varying levels of talent is to give some ownership of a small feature to the weaker member and let them run with it. Funny to be on the other side of that advice now! You're very well poised to make a mark wherever you end up.  Kick some ass.  
  p.s. sleep more


## D: Professional Skills

> This section contains reflections on gear ups and the Turing Professional Development Curriculum

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/nick_jacques.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

  >* [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

  This was a particularly heavy gear-up session that easily could have been twice as long. For a while not I've maintained that the American education system should shift its focus to an empathy-based curriculum. I think that instilling an strong sense of empathy in America's youth will do more to make the world a better place than job preparation or common core standards. It is my opinion that I highly intelligent person who lacks empathy is worth less to society than a less intelligent person with a strong sense of empathy.

  >* [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

  Grit is a word that already had such a well established meaning that I wonder why we are trying to redifine it to mean a combination of perserverance and passion.  Seems like we should just find a new word to avoid confusion/misuse.  


  >* [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

  This was a really interesting gear up and my session got really into the discussion.  For me it is really hard to have a positive outlook when it comes to automation.  I think that the changes that automation will bring will happen faster than we as a society are able to react.  This could have some very grave consequences.  I think our entire economic system will need to be changed in order to accomodate automation and ensure that automation doesn't further put the majority of economic power in the hands of just a few people.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Colleen Ward:

  Colleen, I really enjoyed working with you on this project.  I'm really proud of the projects final outcome and you were a major contributor to its success. You have a strong commitment to using TDD which helped keep our project on track from start to finish.  I probably would have given up on TDD numerous times throughout this project if it wasn't for your patience and commitment to doing it the right way. You displayed a lot of grit and stamina in putting in long hours to make sure the project got done. It seemed like I had to take two breaks for each one of yours. As you probably noticed I can get distracted pretty easily but on this project I felt like you helped to maintain the group's focus and make sure we never fell significantly behind. Overall I think this was one of the best  groups that I have ever worked with and I hope we get another chance to work together before the end of the program

  >* For Craig Ness:

  Craig you were a great asset to our team on the Bike Share Project. You showed a really strong work ethic and were always willing to put in the time and effort to make sure our project got done. I think we all agreed after the project's completion that we really enjoyed our group dynamic and that we were all proud of what we had been able to accomplish. At the beginning of the project you somewhat hesitantly volunteered to lead the effort on styling. Despite your reservations and inexperience with styling you put together a site that Andrew described as the best looking of any that he has evaluated. My only regret about your role in our group is that because you took the lead on styling you did not get to participate as heavily in the other aspects of the project that Colleen and I spent a lot of time pairing on.


##### Feedback from me for Little Shop

  >* For Mark Van Akkeren:

  Mark I appreciated your positive attitude and humorous demeanor throughout the project. You were always able to keep the mood light while we were working together. You were receptive to feedback and willing to step out of your comfort zone to try new things. You displayed great organizational skills by keeping our waffle board up-to-date and taking notes during our feedback sessions. Your were very open about your skillset and where you felt you need improvement. I wish we had a chance to pair one on one this project to address some of the areas that you felt you needed improvement.  Overall I am really happy with what we accomplished as a group and want to thank you for contributing to the projects overall success.

  >* For Riley Thompson:

  Riley you were an awesome partner to work with on this project. We ran into some unique challenges on this project that I think you did an excellent job of handling. You clearly have a very strong grasp of the rails concepts that we have learned so far. While you are very proficient in using rails, I was most impressed by your willingness to commit to writing strong tests and learning FactoryGirl on the fly to help facilitate that. Despite the challenges that we faced in our project you always kept a positive attitude and never let it affect your work ethic. Overall working with you was a really positive experience and I hope I have chance to work with you gain.

#### **Posse**

  >* I joined the Wozniak posse this mod kind of by mistake. It has been really interesting to dive deeper into computer science  concepts which that we don't get much exposure to within the Turing curriculum.  I'm hoping that sticking with the posse through the rest of my time at Turing will help prepare me for technical interviews and some of the more advanced algorithmic concepts that I may encounter at a future job.

#### **Playing a Part**

> This is an area that I am still working to improve upon. I did TA at a Try Turing event which I found both rewarding and fun so I'm hoping to do that a few more times if I have the opportunity.
