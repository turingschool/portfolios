## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

This inning I wanted to focus on polishing my skills as a developer in order to make myself more appealing to potential employers. I want to spend time preparing for the interview process by participating in mock interviews and solving code challenges. By the time we reach graduation I hope to feel confident about my place in the software development industry.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

**Pass**

The assessment was challenging but I felt like it was a good summation of everything we have learned so far at Turing. One of the most difficult aspects of the final assessment was time management. The assessment required a lot of work to complete all of its requirements and it was easy to fall behind if one were to run into issues.

The hardest technical challenge of the project was definitely making sure that the state of the DOM and the state of the database didn't get out of sync. I liked this challenge because it forced me to make use of a lot of client-side logic. My approach to the challenge was to try to keep my client-side logic as clean, readable, and compartmentalized as possible. This helped me keep a mental model of what each function does and what parts of the DOM it affects.

From this project I learned that it is important to have a consistent plan for how your front-end and back-end applications will interact through an API. I had to think carefully about each API endpoint, what that endpoint should do on the backend and what kind of response it should return in order to usefull on the front-end.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

This biggest technical challenge in this project for me was just getting familiar with Javascript and jQuery. This project felt a bit like language immersion. It was really cool to see how much I learned over the course of the project. I definitely did not start this project with a strong enough understanding of Javascript and jQuery to be able to complete it but I was able to learn what I needed along the way. This provided a nice confidence boost to my abilities as a programmer. Technical concepts that I learned during this project include:
* CORS
* DOM manipulation
* Ajax
* Building a front-end and back-end as seperate applications

Having learned more about front-end programming since the completion of this project I would definitely implement a lot of our features differently but I am proud that we were able to complete all of the requirements.

## Capstone Project

My capstone project was to build an app that helps user track their car maintenance. It uses the Edmunds API to find vehicle info by their VIN and creates custom maintenance schedules for that vehicle. The hardest challenge that I have faced so far in this project to build a maintenance schedule from the maintenance data provided by Edmunds. The maintence data provided by Edmunds is not in a very friendly format. I had to build an algorithm that iterates over the data and creates maintence milestones that each contain the correct service items based on their interval mileage.

## Feedback

The most valuable feedback that I recieved this module was from Ian Douglas during my mock interview session with him. He told me that I should carry myself with more confidence while completing coding challenges and trust my knowledge more. I have been doing a lot more coding challenges since then to increase my confidence.

## Gear Up

I thought that planning a gear-up session was valuable because it helped us as students build empathy for our teachers and the work that they do. I think it sometimes goes unappreciated just how hard it is to build effective lesson plans. With the time constraints that we were under it was hard to put together a cohesive session that we would be proud to give. Somehow we pulled it off and it was really rewarding to see how engaged the student who attended our gear up were.

## Community Involvement

This inning I participated in Student Advisory Board for my second term. The most rewarding part of being an SAB representative is getting the opportunity to lead class retros as the end of each week. Despite being a little apprehensive about the responsibility when I were became an SAB rep, I have come to really enjoy that time and my role in facilitating it.

## Going Forward

Going forward I want to focus on three skills that I have developed at Turing: I want to continue to push myself to learn challenging things. I want to make effective use of time-management and organization strategies. And I want to be someone that my coworkers enjoy collaborating with.
