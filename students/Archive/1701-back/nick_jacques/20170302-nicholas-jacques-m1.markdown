## Areas of Emphasis

Going into mod 2 I need to focus on continuing to use test driven development, especially when a project has unfamiliar elements.  I tended to use TDD and find it helpful when I had a strong grasp of the project but got away from it when new concepts were introduced that I didn't understand.

## Self-Assessment Scores

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Projects** | 2.5 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Community** | 3 |

#### Notes

*   I think my understanding of ruby really galvanized in the last 2 weeks of module 1.  I felt a pretty lost for the first 4 weeks but feel much more confident about my abilities now.

#### Notes

*   While my individual project grades show a slight downward trend, I don't feel like these grades accurately reflect how I feel about my skills now, in week 6.  I was really unhappy with how I did on the http project and spent a lot of time practicing ruby fundementals afterwards which I think has paid off.

#### Notes

*   I had pretty low confidence going into Night Writer.  Our project had really good functionality but missed the mark on some of the assessments.  I feel much better about the second group project.


## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://gist.github.com/NicholasJacques/0ea44afcf39a01b190d898f3999cbe6d) to first pairing project DTR.

### Pair Feedback

#### Night Writer (Jack Pincus): 
>
>#### Feedback from Jack:
>  
>##### 3 strengths
>- Great code organization and eye for detail
>- Communicating and being flexible in terms of time management was really good. I never felt like time was being wasted on this project, and I felt like we were pretty efficient with each-other's time
>- Ability to work paired was great, especially at the end. It felt cumbersome to use ping-pong TDD methods, but it ended up working out faster than the first half of the project which was way more laissez faire
>- git
>- keeping up with what the other was thinking and clarifying when there was confusion
>
>##### 3 areas of improvement
>- It would have been better if we had been able to get to coding earlier instead of waiting later in the week. I feel like this was a mutual thing
>- Learning to really use TDD would have been a great thing. Coming into this project, it felt like we both had a bad grasp of TDD, and at the end it felt like we had a basic grasp that really helped the second half of the project
>- Speak up more when your partner starts making things way too complicated
>
>#### Feedback for Jack:
>
>##### Strengths
>- Really strong ability to turn algorthimic concepts into functional code.  I could suggest an idea and you would quickly implement it in the program.
>- Great time management, time spent coding was focused with few distractions.  
>- We figured out a basic github workflow. No catastrophes.
>- File IO master.
>- Overall a really positive pairing experience.
>    
>##### Opportunities for Improvement
>- Slow down and commit to TDD. We both struggled with this and probably enabled each other in neglecting it.  Once we tried to implement we made good progress.  We both clearly have a lot more too learn about TDD.
>- You might be able to combat overly-complicated-method syndrome by talking through these methods with your pair.  You have an impressive ability to make it "do the thing" but there were a few methods in our project that I never really got a full grasp of how they worked.  As you mentioned, I definitely should have been more proactive about speaking up when that occurred.

#### Black Thursday (Sergey Lukyanenko):
>
>##### Feedback from Sergey:
>
>It’s been a very productive and joyful time to work with Nick. His dedication and passion for coding is a big part of his life. He put a lot of effort and time into our project. During our project time Nick showed great skills in working with a large amount of data and connecting multiple objects together into working methods and classes. He has a clear vision of the problems that need to be solved and quickly finds a solution by using all available tools.
>He is very friendly and openminded. Nick never hesitates to ask for advice from students around and willingly offers his support and knowledge to others.
>I look forward to working with Nick on future projects and wish him success in pursuing his goals.
>
>##### Feedback for Sergey:
>
>Overall I’m pretty happy with how this project turned out.  I wish we had a couple more days to polish it but I think that will be the case with every project.  I was really impressed with your stamina and attitude during the project.  You were always willing to stay late and work as hard as we needed to.  I think you did really good at organizing work time and setting up pairing sessions.  I didn’t take advantage of pairing with mentors in the past and I’m glad you showed me how helpful is can be.  I also really admired your desire to have a deeper understanding of the way things worked within our code.  The questions you asked were consistently driving development and helped us gain a better understanding of the project.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

I thought this session was really valiable in preparing us for the rollercoaster of emotions that we would be experiencing in the upcoming weeks.  Being immersed in something that I didn't understand was stressful and challenging but I was able to use some of the growth mindset techniques that we learned in this gear up to push through the low moments.  This gear up made me thing about some times in my life that I had succumbed to a 'fixed mindset' and how I had to overcome that fixed mindset to even consider applying for Turing school.  I think one of the biggest challenges to maintaining a growth mindset at Turing has been seeing other people get concepts seemingly faster and more easily than myself.  I have had to work really hard to make sure that I am only comparing my accomplishments to my own progress, and not other peoples.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

In this session we learned about the trials and rewards of working to get better at difficult things.  This was pretty strongly tied to our previous gear-up on growth mindset.  My two biggest take-aways from this gear up are that my emotional state can have a huge impact on my ability to learn and grow and that getting better at difficult things requires a certain amount of 'grit'.  If I allow myself to become frustrated or discouraged it can completely shutdown my learning.  I need to be conscious of this and make an effort avoid pushing myself to the point that my emotions negatively affect my ability to learn.  Getting better at difficult things naturally doesn't come easily.  It requires a concerted effort and level of 'grit' to work through adverse situations.  This has proven to be very true so far at Turing School. 

#### Session 3: Managing Stress
This gear up happened after a really busy weekend in which I didn't do a very good job of preparing myself for the upcoming week.  I definitely felt like I was paying for my lack of preparation.  This gear up helped reinforce that the best way to manage stress is to take a prevantative approach.  If I can set my self up to succees then I will have fewer stressful situations to manage.

#### Session 4: Shares Values
In this session we reflected on our personal values and the lense that we see the world through.  We also reflected on why we decided to attend Turing school.  I decided to attend Turing school for a few reasons.  I felt really dissatisfied with my previous work environment. In the past I did not work in very progressive fields and didn't feel like it was a good fit for me.  I also wanted to learn skills that would give me the opportunity to have financial security for the rest of my life.  Finally, I wanted to apply myself and challenge myself more than I had in the past.  When reflecting with other students we found that we had a lot of common reasons for attending turing school.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
In this session we watched the moving "Debugging the Gender Gap" and then spent time reflecting on the Turing School environment comparing that to the environment that is common in the tech industry.  The members or my reflection group all agreed that we had come from much less inclusive environments than Turing School and that Turing School felt like a breath of fresh air.  We also agreed that although the environment at Turing School is really inclusive, that doesn't mean that it is flawless and that we can still work to improve it.


### Community Participation
This is something that I can definitely continue to work on.  I tried to be available to help people whenever I felt like I could.  I decided to volunteer at the next Try Turing event as a way to get more involved with the community.

## Final Review

*   Rocky start at beginning, finishing strong
*   Solid work on Black Thursday, crushed it
*   Great addition to the cohort

### Outcome
