# Nicholas Jacques - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> In this module I wanted to dive deeper into rails concepts and learn about consuming and building APIs. I also wanted to focus on concepts that might be relevant to the industry that I would like to work in.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
> **[link to repo](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/API_curious)**
>* This project required us to create a clone of Github using githubs API
>* I didn't originally get as far on this as I would have liked. I started this project over when I had a better understanding of consuming API's but that repo is not hosted on Github.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> **[link to repo](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/rails_engine)**
>* This project creates an internal analytics API for analyzing and serving sales data as JSON
>* Overall this project went really well and I enjoyed working on it. I plan to look over the ActiveRecord portion of the project as this was definitely the hardest part for me.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/corkboard)**
>* In this project we attempted to clone the website 'Thumbtack'
>* This project was challenging for a number of reasons. Our database schema was particularly challenging and the site required a lot of work to get the base functionality in place. This left me with little time to work on my personal user story. I did enjoy my user story, however, and I feel as though I have a really good understanding of how polymorphism works as a result.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* This was a brownfield project in which we added functionality to an existing clone of the website 'Kickstarter'
>* I had a lot going on outside of school during this project and didn't get to participate on it as much as I would have liked. My user story involved using background workers and mailers to send confirmation emails. I ran into issues trying to get url_helpers to render in my mailer that I'm still working on figuring out.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
I guess my biggest takeaway from this gearup is that while microaggressions may sounds insignificant on their own, base they can have a large cumulative affect.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
This was possibly the most interesting gear-up that I've attended. The Parable of the Polygons was an incredibly effective way to visually explain a complex topic. This was a concept that I was completely unaware which made the gear-up particularly eye-opening.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
I attended the Black Mirror gear up on how our online presence affects our everyday life. This is something that I think about a lot when viewing social media. It sometime feels like people, myself included, seek out new experiences for the purpose of documenting it and posting it to social media.  


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Lauren and I led a spike on testing with FactoryGirl and RSpec. It didn't get great attendance because of timing but of the few people who did attend, they all seemed to really appreciate it and enjoy it. I gained a much greater appreciation for how hard it it to build lesson plans from this spike.
