## B: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/dannyradden/APICurious)**
I wasnt able to completely finish APIcurious, but I feel I learned a lot from what I did complete.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

[Github](https://github.com/somedayrainbows/ralesengine)

I really enjoyed working with Erin on this project. It went well and I learned a lot about building an API.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/glassjoseph/grab_bag)**

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/stovermc/grab_bag)**

Overall I am super satisfied with the way this project came out. I ended up staying on the same project for both sprints. It was interesting having new team members the second sprint and trying to explain the code to them.
