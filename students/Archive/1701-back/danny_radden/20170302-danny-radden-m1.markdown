### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*  **Project 1 (Mark Van Akkeren):**

      **Feedback for Mark:**

      You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility and enthusiasm with working on the project. You had a good grasp on what we had to do and what the assessors were expecting from us. I think we both should have done a better job with TDD. We should have done more TDD from the beginning. Also, you made David Hasselhoff too skinny. You need to work on you ASCII conversion skills. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well.

      **Feedback from Mark:**

      This went pretty smooth.  It would be interesting to work together again on a harder project, maybe at that point some difficulties or struggles might get sussed out but when the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I was massively impressed with your familiarity in calling concise methods point by point when modifying data.  I'll take a lot away from that.  When you wanted to refactor my code you took the time to walk me thru it and help me with a better understanding of the process.  There ain't no shit here... because we finished so quickly, and refactored quickly you then were taking the time to help others out.  Only positive vibes.

*  **Project 2 (Christopher Dale):**

      **Feedback for Chris:**

      You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility with working on the project. At first you seemed to have some trouble with methods that traversed different classes, but it seemed to clear up as time went on. You still have some work to do with improving your ruby syntax, but it also improved as the project progressed. Just keep practicing and looking up things in Ruby Docs! I think we both did a pretty good at following TDD guidelines and with our DTR. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well. Thanks for everything!

      **Feedback from Chris:**

      It was a great experience to work with you on Black Thursday.  I feel like I got to know you better as a person and as a student while working on this project together.  I think our DTR was good and everything we set out was met.  You helped explain things in a detailed manner whether we were working next to each other or when you and I had met back up.  I wished we did some white boarding or written in a notebook so I can refer to it later, that might have helped me to try to map some of the methods and what they were doing, so as to allow me more tools to be able to help you.
      Regardless I appreciated our working together, I look forward to seeing what you are fully capable of.  I think you also should offer your services to more people.  I think the entire school would benefit from it.  Good luck in all your future endeavors.  See you around.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
This gear up was about the growth mindset. We learned about how people can learn subjects that they aren't originally good at if they keep a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. I think that growth mind set is really interesting. I learned about triggers that move me to a fixed mindset and things that encourage a growth mindset. This was a overall helpful gear up session.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
This gear up was a little bit of a continuation of growth mindset and how to get better at difficult things. One thing that we talked about was breaking up difficult tasks into smaller tasks in order to perfect them. I think that this is a great idea and will be helpful for me. We also talked more about growth mindset, and how keeping a growth mindset can help us do things we never thought we could do.

#### Session 3: Stress Management
This gear up was about action planning and different ways to manage stress. I haven't been too stressed so far, but I still think this was a nice Gear Up. It's a good reminder to use off ramps to manage stress and not take out your stress in a negative way such as anger or isolation.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories and Connections
This gear up was about our values, our world lenses, and how they are used and identified at Turing. I don't feel like I got much out of this gear up because I don't think I really learned anything about myself. I already knew my values and how they drive me.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
I was sick and missed this one. :(

### Community Participation
I help my peers on homework and projects. I think that I have been an enthusiastic participant in spikes and gear ups. I gave an awesome lightning talk on Epigenetics. I helped to clean the kitchen.
