## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - To solve a problem using jQuery.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - I used browser debugging tools to break the problem down into pieces.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - I like to work on a project in pairs.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - JavaScript file structure. Testing in JavaScript. Working with jQuery
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  - I would refactor index.js
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  - It was a great experience. The partner that I worked with is strong in technical approach

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - To build up a map that gets endpoints of another user and to post on a map. Working with map is challenging.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - I build my app on rails. Created endpoints for the user. And inside JavaScript file I build a function that consumed it and posted it on a map.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - That this app works with google map, JavaScript and Rails
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  1. Implement Ajax inside the google map
  2. Add listener to google marker.
  3. Consuming current longitude and latitude to display current location of all users

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
  - One of the meaningful feedbacks I received was from my mentor who graduated Turing School a year ago. Her feedback built a confidence in me and helped me to finish school successfully.
## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
  - Our gear up was about giving back. Giving back, even (especially) when you think you can't.
At first during the planning of the gear up session we discussed what are the ways to contribute. We shared our experiences.
On revising a session, we watched a ted talk video "Getting Involved and Giving Back As A Beginner"
The most challenging was to give back and focus on others when you think you are too busy and you can't.
And the most rewarding was to get feedback from the students.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
  - Building up a friendship. Sharing knowledge and experience with others. I think this is important skill to have wth your future work environment.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
1. Ability to work hard and long hour
2. Ability to solve challenges
3. All the technical knowledge and experience of programming languages I learnt at Turing school during six month.
