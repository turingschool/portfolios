# Sergey Lukyanenko - M1 Portfolio

## Self-Assessment Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Community** | 3 |

#### Notes
*   Note: Its been an intensive module and Ive spent around 60 - 70 hours a week for studying.
I don't think the more is better cause life/work shoud be in balance. Turing provides great path
with material, teachers and methodology for succeding in learning proccess. I would say with almost 
no background in coding I've overcame this path with a good balance and rated myself accordingly.
Areas to improve would be:
Participate and engage more into community.
Practice drills to gain speed in typing.

#### Notes
*   Note: hhtp project brought some low grades to my portfolio. 
But I consider it as a part of the learning process. Cause this project
was out of our knowledge field in many ways so it let us learn how
to search for answers, pair up with upper mod students and discover 
new field of information.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Victoria Vasys): It was really nice working with you! I think we balanced each other out in many helpful ways, but I especially appreciated your ability to know when to step away, take breaks, refresh & re-gather. It really helped to have you brainstorm & sketch out the way you saw different aspects of the project going & helped us keep the important stuff at the forefront. Your positive attitude really helped me step out of some serious and/or frustrating moments & it felt really good to have celebrations for every little accomplishment we made! I think you would benefit from diving into Ruby docs and getting some more understanding of various methods, especially for Enumberables (although we only *just* started learning those, so don't feel like you're behind or anything!) I would highly recommend doing exercises whenever (or if ever...) you have free time. I think we could both use more practice in Object Oriented Programming, especially with single-responsibility (less daisy-chaining)-- so if you find good resources on practice with that, I'd really appreciate links! Thanks for being such a great collaborator, encouraging me be more outgoing in asking questions & keeping us on task; I think we both learned a lot & it was a great first paired programming experience! Well done, sir! :)

 My feedback to Victoria Vasys: You were a great asset to the team. You are very professional and focused on your work. Despite the difficult deadlines for the Night Writer Project, you maintained a positive attitude. You responded to problems without getting frustrated. You often stayed late working and were very conscientious of timelines and resources. When fixing a problem, you readily explained how you were fixing it. One thing to possibly improve in your skills is dividing responsibilities of the project parts with your team, allowing your partner to be more involved in coding of the project. It has been wonderful working with you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.

*   Project 2 (Nicholas Jacques): Overall I’m pretty happy with how this project turned out.  I wish we had a couple more days to polish it but I think that will be the case with every project.  I was really impressed with your stamina and attitude during the project.  You were always willing to stay late and work as hard as we needed to.  I think you did really good at organizing work time and setting up pairing sessions.  I didn’t take advantage of pairing with mentors in the past and I’m glad you showed me how helpful is can be.  I also really admired your desire to have a deeper understanding of the way things worked within our code.  The questions you asked were consistently driving development and helped us gain a better understanding of the project.

 My feedback to Nicholas Jacques: It’s been a very productive and joyful time to work with Nick. His dedication and passion for coding is a big part of his life. He put a lot of effort and time into our project. During our project time Nick showed great skills in working with a large amount of data and connecting multiple objects together into working methods and classes. He has a clear vision of the problems that need to be solved and quickly finds a solution by using all available tools. He is very friendly and openminded. Nick never hesitates to ask for advice from students around and willingly offers his support and knowledge to others. I look forward to working with Nick on future projects and wish him success in pursuing his goals.

 * By taking some extra time and effort to view each person as an individual. Supporting people from diverse background.

### Community Participation
Portfolio feedback from Alisher Sadikov Module 1608: "During our pairing sessions with Sergey I noticed that he was a hard-working guy who put in the hours and made consistent progress from week to week. I also respect the facts that he was finding time to do drills when he was buried under projects,always used TDD etc. I believe he has a bright future as a developer."

My Portfolio feedback for Alisher Sadikov Module 1608: "As a module 1 student I had many projects and assignments which require hard work and persistence to learn new information. I'm very thankful to have pairing session with Alisher. With his knowledge and experience in programming he patiently and with courage helped me to make my studying process more productive. As a mentor he supported me emotionally and taught me many coding technics. It's been a pleasure  to work with Alisher. I wish him success in his professional career and continue sharing knowledge and experience with Turing family."
