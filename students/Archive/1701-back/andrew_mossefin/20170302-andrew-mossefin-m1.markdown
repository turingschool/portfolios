# Andrew Mossefin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to get comfortable with the general concepts of code structure. Besides that, I wanted to push myself just a bit further than I thought I was capable of. I believe I succeeded in both of those goals.

#### Notes

*   HTTP was the first project where I consciously tried to focus on implementing TDD and refactoring. It was the wrong project to start this practice. I made it well into Iteration 3 before realizing I had no tests, so I wiped the code and started completely over by testing first. Faraday would output different responses than the browser, so that threw me off while learning to write tests. By the time it was due it had devolved into an illegible mess (on my local repo).
*   Complete Me may have been a bit too ambitious for my ability at the time. The code ran and worked as intended, but I was not skilled enough to write the code in the parent/child node structure that the spec intended it to be.

#### Notes

*   Night Writer was a great first pairing experience, but it would have been helpful to have face to face pairing time (partner was unable to due to scheduling conflicts).
*   Absolutely loved the final project. Although it was definitely the largest in scope, I learned an incredible amount from it.

### Pair Feedback

####   Night Writer (Ken Lee)

>Hey Andrew, it was great working with you on the Night Writer project. You showed me how bad ass you were at ripping through codes. I like our interaction when figuring out problems. That we played on each others strengths and knowledge to get things done. Your calm and  letting me know to take breaks helped me stay focused on the task at hand. To make things more smoother next time I would get more comfortable with using Git, TTD, and workflow tools(spectacle, vs code, etc). Like we discussed we both need to work better at planning out projects, to which we both will start bullet pointing our projects into task. Your enthusiasm and willingness to work like a rabid dog is inspiring.

#### Black Thursday (Mark Stover)

>Andrew, it was a real pleasure working with you on Black Thursday. 
>
> For starters, your clam demeanor backed with a positive attitude made it fun and easy to spend time together working on our project, even through the most challenging parts. Additionally, your patience is admirable.  I really appreciated the way you calmly took control of our pairing session the day I was grappling with Invoice Items. These traits make you a very easy to work with and I believe will take your far in the future. Technically, I think our skills balanced out really well. Your ability to work your way through a problem in a pry session was something that always kept us moving. Your logic is sound and you consistently produced nice code. The only feedback I can think of is to start working on some key board shortcuts. I think this would help speed up your workflow as you move between your text editor, and terminal, helping to move through pry sessions a little quicker. Obviously not mission critical, just an additional skill to pile onto your already impressive repertoire. Again, I really enjoy working on this project with you. I learned a ton, both from the project, and from yourself. I hope we get paired again in the future!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
I've tended in the past to have a more fixed mindset. If something didn't come easily to me, I would give up rather quickly and just decide that it wasn't for me. The big trigger for me with fixed minset is competition. It's discouraging becuase I tend to compare myself to others in that setting. A collaborative environment allows my to focus on building a growth mindset, which thankfully this school is that kind of a setting. We all have to encourage each other not to give up when things get difficult in order to maintain that growth mindset.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
For me, learning came very easily when I was younger. In school I didn't have to study very much to do well on tests. As I've grown , it's become more difficult. Just like any other muscle, the brain weakens if you don't excercise it. That's a big part of why I wanted to come here, to flex the logical and problem solving side of my mind again. I've struggled with ADHD and drepression since I was very young, so emotional state of mind has generally played a large role in how well I'm able to learn. Over the past year or two, I've worked hard to finally manage those issues in order to begin learning again.

#### Session 3: Stress Management
Learning TDD has challanged my growth mindset because if I know already what code i'm going to write, I didn't see the point in writting tests beforehand. AFter shifting my stubborn mindset, I was able to see the value in that method. I've managed stress in both healthy and unhealthy ways. Sometimes it's with drinking, sometimes it's with excersize. The most effective method I have is to get out into the mountains. I do need to get better at recognizing when I'm coping with stress in unhealthy ways.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories and Connection
What brought me to turing was a complete disatisfaction with what I was doing for a living. I felt like I wasn't living up to my potential to do something I truly enjoyed. After evaluating my strengths and passions, this is where I landed.
Most of the time I tend to view the world with an open mind, but much of the time am looking through the lense of being stuck in my head.
My driving values are to do everything i can to try and live a fullfilling life for myself, but not at the expense of others well being. I'm not one to step on someone else just to get ahead 

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
My experience so far at Turing has been what I believe to be the goal that the film wants to acheive. We have a pretty diverse group of men and women, who through the interactions I've seen and had generally treat each other as equal peers. I often will turn to the girls of our cohort for help or an opinion if I get stuck. I also try to assert thati genuinely value their help. We never know how we appear to someone else outside ourselves, but I'd like to think I try to treat everyone with the same amount of respect. 

### Community Participation
I've tried to participate in Gear Up discussions as often as possible by being the speaker of the small groups or offering opinions in the larger conversations. In school I'm always happy to help anyone who asks for it, and will ask if it just looks like someone my need it. I also try to get to to lunch or happy hours whenever I can to better get to know my classsmates.
