# \Jack Pincus - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 Wanted to do some personal projects and get a good head start on job hunting. I feel good on both of these fronts. I made a project that I think is pretty cool for the code fair. I have at least one interview lined up for the break, and have a few other things in the pipeline.

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)NOT GRADED**
 An API consumption project designed to oath into Github and pull down a user's unformation and replicate it on a locally served page.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine) PASS**
 + A business intelligence API
>* Had a lot more fun doing queries in raw SQL. Will definitely stick to that in the future. This was a really challenging project to start out a mod with. It was really rewarding to get some of the complicated queries to work.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)PASS**
>* Make a clone of Kickstarter
>* Project management is hard when goals are misaligned

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)YET TO BE EVALED**
>* Keep making a clone of Kickstarter

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
+ None available
> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
+ As expected
* Nice job testing Twillio and stubbing that out. Keep up the testing!
* Some refactoring in the sessions controller to dry up the create method. It could be multiple methods.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
Microagressions are something that we need to be continuously conscious of to build a more inclusive, representative, and fair industry

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
This gearup seemed to be poorly named. Not sure what it had to do with what we normally call tragedy of the commons. It seemed to explore the externalities involved in biased preferences and how that can force unforeseen outcomes.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
Knowledge is a tricky subject. What we do and don't know can be largely up to interpretation. Strong opinions held loosely and all that. Also, Mod 4 students seem to not care about teaching gear up


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
Lightning talk about the genesis of ideas and innovation

#### **Posse**
Built an api to serve up locations of food sources in Denver for Pahlke.
Finally getting to work with front end and build a project
