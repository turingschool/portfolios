## Areas of Emphasis

I've been focusing on improving my macro approach to projects by whiteboarding, then writing tests, then pseudocoding, and only putting code to IDE when I feel confident about the relationships between the various components of a project. I've also focused on writing code that is more "Rubyish". I have a JavaScript background, and I realize that while it is totally possible to accomplish the same thing in Ruby using a very similar approach as I would with JS, the strength of Ruby comes from community conventions that emphasize readability above all else.

#### Assessor Comments

Notes from Beth on Pairing Assessment
-    Solid tests and Ruby style
-    Solid collaboration: checking in periodically and confirming approach before implementing
-    Workflow solid
-    Area for improvement: collaboration and testing; slowing down and moving incrementally leads to cadence of small successes, more accessible.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Night Writer (Natalie Barron): 
  
  **From Natalie:**

  Sam, you have a really good understanding of ruby. You are great at explaining things that are unclear or walking me through a process. You have strong project planning skills and the effort we put into preplanning the entire project was really beneficial.  Communication was great. The biggest challenge we faced in this project was the disparity between our levels of ruby. As we discussed in our retro, when working with someone who has less ruby experience, adjust your work pace and process so collaboration can be more inclusive. Also take into account the time commitment necessary for someone who isn’t at the same ruby level because it may take them longer to work their way to a solution. That said, I appreciate the effort you made to adjust to my level of understanding and taking time to clarify ruby concepts. Thank you for the work that you did and your commitment to working together to complete the project. 

  **To Natalie:**

  I want to thank you for a successful week of collaboration. You helped me achieve my goal of starting a project with a top-down approach — looking at the big picture idea before executing. You also kept us organized, and I feel like I learned a lesson about the value of budgeting time from you. It was also a relief to have frequent, frank conversations about our collaboration. That level of communication was helpful in navigating new terrain for both of us. To repeat a bit from one of those conversations, I think you would be well served by cementing a strong, fundamental understanding of Ruby, and it sounds like you're taking steps to achieve that. For future collaboration, continuing to be assertive with your needs will be helpful to any group, I'm sure. I'm proud of the work we did together, and I like that we executed a unique solution to the challenge, which was your brainchild. I look forward to seeing more cool ideas from you and just hanging out around Turing. Feel free to reach out if you ever want another pair of eyes on your code.

  **From Erin**

  Dear Sam,

  I loved working with you on this project. I appreciate your commitment to me as your partner and to this project, and I also appreciate you letting me drive so much so that I could gain the significant experience I took away from this project. It’s clear to me that you are very invested in overall team success and project experience.
    
  Your strengths include:
  - Super positive
  - Flexible attitude
  - Easy going
  - Knowledgeable about various Ruby methods
  - Creative in writing code
  - Patient
  - Communicative and open

  Things you need to work on:
  - Not a thing! I would have put TDD if we were at the beginning of the project, but you’re an old pro at it now.

  Thanks for an excellent project/partner experience. I really hope we get to work together again!

  Erin

  **To Erin**

  It was a joy working with you! I appreciated your commitment to having a successful collaboration experience. Our daily retros helped us calibrate our shared time and project strategy, which was awesome and productive. I believe we spent virtually every minute of work time on this project together, which was a first for me. I value constructive feedback at moments like these, but I'm struggling to think of anything I think you could have done differently to improve our experience. As far as your personal development with code goes, I think you're making swift progress through new terrain, and it's clear that you're not limited by algorithmic thinking or any higher-order concepts. The walls you hit always seemed to be about syntax issues and Ruby functionality, and those will recede as you continue engaging the language. So I guess my only advice for the future is keep on trucking! I look forward to working with you on future projects.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
Culturally, we tend to operate with a fixed mindset. Only outcomes are praised, struggle is a sign of weakness and your current situation predicts your future success. While this is the attitude and mindset that we learn in school and many jobs, it is not the only way to think about the world, and it is certainly not helpful in learning a new school. Objectively, it is impossible to improve a skill, and the process of improving that skill is often stressful and uncomfortable. Applauding that struggle, embracing that hardship as an indication of progress will make our time here more enjoyable and productive.

#### Session 2 - Cognitive Resources
We are creatures with physical limitations that everyone acknowledges: We need food, air, sleep, shelter. It is a less common notion that we are also limited mentally by a finite supply of focus, concentration or just cognitive resources for lack of a better word. We expend our cognitive resources on every task that can't be accomplished through impulse and habit. So, for example, restricting what you eat to improve your health will drain your cognitive tank until that behavior is ingrained to the point of habit. This is important to remember since we have dived into a new environment with new expectations and challenges, which means that virtually everything will initially drain our cognitive resources. A person drained of those resources will fall back on operating purely on habit and impulse, so that's dangerous if your success relies on behaving in a new way (Creating a server, for example). The two solutions are moving new tasks into the category of learned behaviors that can be handled through habit, so with less cognitive drain, or strengthening your cognitive resources. Or do both. That's probably best.

#### Session 3 - Stress Management
Stress left unchecked can make us do dumb things. Common responses to stress fall on the spectrums of attacking others or attacking ourselves and withdrawing from the world or avoiding problems. Since we're intentionally ramping up our stress levels to learn a new skill, it's reasonable that we ensure we're taking precautions to preemptively manage stress, or derail it when we feel it's getting unmanageable. Preemptive techniques fall under the umbrella of Handle Your Shit while emergency-derailing maneuvers are varied. I settled on, if I feel that I'm about to do something dumb because of stress, disconnecting from whatever I'm doing and going to a movie at a theater and buying a big bucket of popcorn.

#### Session 4 - Personal Stories and Connections
We are a diverse group of students from varied backgrounds with unique experiences, ambitions and personalities. These differences will strengthen our cohort, and knowing how we fit into that tapestry helps us contribute to and benefit from our group. Personally, I came to Turing to learn a valuable skill set to become a valuable person. I know I bring a strong work ethic, curiosity and technical skillset to any team I'm on. This gearup helped me recognize what I can contribute to a team.

#### Session 5 - Debugging the Gender Gap
Women and girls don't receive the same systemic support and encouragement that men get to work with technology. This translates to extreme under-representation of women in the tech industry. While this is a problem in terms of equal opportunity, it also creates problems in development. If men are making software, software will work better for men, and 50% of users will be alienated from the final product. Addressing this issue will, as a first step, require acknowledging it exists. As students entering the workforce, we can refuse to ignore the issue or accept it as a harsh reality that we can't change. 

### Community Participation
I've done my best to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Turing community. I'm participating in the Bezos posse, Monday productivity lunches and Wednesday morning guided meditation. I've attended all Friday guest speakers and try to take advantge of whatever spike is most compelling. I've connected with a mentor through Turing, as well.

I'm trying to contribute to the community, as well. I led a remote meetup to go over recursion, I started a daily meditation group, and I led a spike on data structures which I hope to turn into a recurring thing. I intentionally made a choice to study software development in person, on a campus, to challenge myself socially, and I feel like I'm living up to that challenge I set to myself.
