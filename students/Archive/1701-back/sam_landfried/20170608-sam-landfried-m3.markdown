# Sam Landfried - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod, I tried to concentrate my attention on activities that would best prepare me for the job hunt. This involved networking and developing my proffesional branding in addition to applying to jobs.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* I continued to work with the Slack API in an attempt to build out a personal project.
>* This was a good experience for learning how to consume APIs more effectively with service objects and models.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* We built an API to serve business analytics.
>* I need to work on my ActiveRecord skills.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* My group cloned DropBox.
>* This was the first very functional app I have built. It was great to integrate it with AWS and build a complicated schema that effectively replicated DropBox functionality.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* I extracted AirBnB's messaging into an external service hosted on Digital Ocean.
>* I got to work with a Linux VPS for the first time, which was a good learning experience. I also liked the process of extracting part of a site's functionality to make it more flexible.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

A microagression occurs when someone is treated differently because of their background, which sends the message, 'You don't belong here'. Sometimes these are innocuous off hand comments that are unintentionally hurtful, and sometimes the ignorance is more obvious. It is are job to be aware of these microagressions to keep ourselves from offending, and to ally with those that might be affected. 

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
I attended the 'Dangers of a Single Story' gear up. Basically, we let ourselves believe a single story about people because of their backgrounds. Humans are great at generalizing and stereotyping, which is how we process tons of information and can function in the world. The danger comes when we believe incorrect things about people, or make assumptions about them without recognizing their individuality.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I was a leader of the Wozniak Posse and paired with other students.

#### **Posse**
  >* Woz Poz focused on practicing technical interviews.
  >* It was nice to focus on algorithmic challenges.
  >* It has made me more aware of my own strengths and interests, in addition to improving my technical interview skills.

#### **Playing a Part**

I've done my best to participate in cohort retros and group projects in meaningful ways.
