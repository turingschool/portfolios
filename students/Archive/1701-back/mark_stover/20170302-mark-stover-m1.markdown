# Mark Stover - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Module 1, I had the expectations of learning the fundamental building blocks required to create a functioning program in Ruby. Needless to say, I learned that and more. After an exposure to Test Driven Development, Object Relational Mapping, ruby enumerables, data types and data structures, I feel my foundation as a developer is sound. I can confidently say, my expectations for Module 1 have been exceeded.

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKnfByzId1sPMEEGWohDPWINs_I_qj6hSDL0_GokA0k/edit#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg) from Black-Thursday.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1: Night-Writer (Chris Dale):
>It was a pleasure to work with you. I was happy from day 1 after we sat and talked through the DTR. I feel it was really constructive and put us on a good footing with each other right off the bat. I think we made a great team, I hope I was able to give you as much insight as you gave me. I have a difficult time sometimes with new things and the driver/navigator roles we filled helped me out a lot. I look forward to working with you in the future and am glad I can call you friend.

#### Project 2: Black Thursday (Andrew Mossfin):
>You sir, will be a tough act for the next project partner to follow. We both learned so much from this project due to our ability to bounce off one another. The communication was great, and so was the work produced. I appreciate your ability to take constructive criticisms well, but also to give them in a way that isn’t at all abrasive. That's what allowed us to keep grinding away at a feverish pace but still in good spirits. I know i’m supposed to give an example of room for improvement, but I’m drawing a blank. You’re a solid programmer and an even more solid person. Hope we get to work together again sometime in the future.

#### Session 1

This week was very challenging. With each passing day the amount of information that was needed to be learned was more than I have ever experienced. It was also some of the most difficult to understand. There were many times when I struggled to understand a concept and had to try really hard to remind myself that the struggle is one of the most important parts of the learning process. For me, this helped to promote a growth mindset. In the past, if I struggled to understand a concept in school, I often would avoid the struggle and tell myself that I just wasn't cut out for that type of work. This is a great example of a fixed mindset I have had in the past. Currently, comparing myself to others or watching others understand a concept more quickly than I do triggers a fixed mindset within me. It triggers the feeling; because I am not understanding as rapidly, I must not be able to learn this thing as well. This is obviously not the case. We are all able to learn the material. What this fixed mindset does not consider, is that we all have come to Turing with various technical backgrounds. Initially, some may have to try harder to understand, simply because this type of material is more foreign than it may be for others. It does not mean that one cannot learn it. In order to encourage a growth mindset within me, feeling like I have a comfortable space to feel vulnerable is very important. This space allows for all questions to be asked. Both my peers and the staff have done a wonderful job in promoting this.


#### Session 2

An effort I take to manage my learning process is to first realize and understand that it is impossible to learn everything all at once. It is important to pick particular skill sets and practice them, i.e Enumerables, Mythical Creatures, Class structure, etc. I have to force myself to realize that taking the time to perfect each individual part of the puzzle will help the picture more accurately come together. It is becoming apparent to me that this is how much of the module is structured. I need to allow myself to trust in this process! In the movies we watched, Coate's material spoke to the exact same feelings I have been feeling while trying to learn to program. It is hard, and I feel like I am stumbling along. Understanding that it is normal to feel this way is important. By doing so, I will be able to more fully appreciate the brief moments when everything I am learning actually makes sense. Sierra's material also felt very relevant. Each time we are taught something new, the challenge of understanding this new thing makes every thing else just a little bit harder. For example, trying to implement a new tool in a text editor can make the rest of your work flow a bit more cumbersome until the tool is better understood. From an emotional standpoint, it is important for me to fully appreciate my successes. By doing this, I am able to better track the progress I have made. It also encourages me to continue learning more, it even makes me feel like I am good at it! This emotional state makes it easier to tackle harder problems. The feeling that I understand the material provides a positive boost when I get stuck. Alternatively, failures are also useful when viewed from the right perspective. They can be motivational in their own right, helping me to focus in areas that I lack understanding. It is important to not let failure consume my emotional state because then I begin to feel overwhelmed and this significantly impacts my productivity.

#### Session 3

In the past, things that have gone well for me when dealing with stressful situations typically came about when I was able to identify that I was, in fact, stressed. When I am able to do this, I am then able to better manage it. Often times to help reduce my stress level I will try to get outside and walk my dogs, exercise in the mountains, and talk to loved ones. In the past, when I was unable to identify early enough that I was getting stressed, I would allow it to escalate to unhealthy levels. When I am very stressed I can get be very short with others; friends, significant others, etc. In the case of having many projects or tasks that need to be accomplished, I can become paralyzed by stress. It makes it very hard for me to start working on the things that I need to accomplish, furthering the stress levels. Essentially, the 'ole downward spiral.

#### Session 4

An enjoyment for being in a tech office and realizing I needed more education to move my career forward is what brought me to Turing. This change in life direction accurately reflects the lenses I view the world through. I view the world through a lens of positivity, always identifying and highlighting the best of a situation, and the best in a person. I also view through a lens of generosity. Often, I will give up a portion of my happiness in order to ensure the happiness of others. Ultimately, once this is achieved, the happiness I feel is far greater than the initial happiness lost in the process of engaging another person. Lastly, I view the world through through a lens of honestly. I demonstrate honesty to the people around me by striving to be the truest version of myself in all situations, even if I am upset. I demonstrate generosity by ensuring people feel comfortable and happy while I am in their presence. This can take many forms; sharing time, ideas, snacks, beer money. The simple act of giving is something I try to do each day. I demonstrate positivity by always viewing the glass as half full. However, I also am able to identify shortcomings or negative elements in a given situation. Mostly, I feel it is ok to maintain a positive perspective even in a bad situation. This is something I hope to contribute to the day-to-day ups-and-downs of our cohort. At times I can be shy in large groups. In terms of our cohort I think when we are a large group, others may not have the opportunity to see my values since I keep them to myself. In small group interactions or 1-on-1's I think that these values may be more apparent.

#### Session 5

Debugging the gender gap was a great movie full of insight. The gender gap in the tech industry is something I have heard a lot about and the movie gave me a lot of context to help better understand it. It helped to reinforce my feeling that being a white male, it is especially important to be aware of the privilege that I have, and to leverage it in a way that provides a community of inclusion of all people. It is a view that I will take with me from Turing and into every office in my professional career. The group conversations we had after the movie was also very insightful. It was a nice opportunity share ideas regarding the gender gap from both male and female perspectives. Having a safe place to openly talk about sensitive issues is something I value greatly and I appreciated the opportunity to do so.

### Community Participation
I have made it a point to collaborate with each member of our cohort. It is my opinion, that the more Collaboration there this, the more cohesive our cohort will be and the more inclusive it will feel for all of us. Additionally, I have participated in lunch roulette when available, further extending my collaborations to the larger Turing community. This has proved useful in setting up opportunities for pairing sessions with upper mod students that may otherwise have not come to fruition. Lastly, it is my hope that I have provided enough optimistic smiles and high fives to help keep the energy in the basement less stressful and more fun.
