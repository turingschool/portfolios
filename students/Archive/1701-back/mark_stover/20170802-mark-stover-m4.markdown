## Area of Emphasis

> Coming from three mods of back-end learning, I am excited to gain a better understanding of the front-end. Specifically, I am interested in focusing on learning JavaScript and the benefits of using it to develop a front-end application. By graduation, I hope to have experience working on the whole stack. I want to gain understanding on how the back-end and front-end communicate and learn some common design patterns around this type of application. 

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> During our assesment, the biggest technical challenge I ran into was allowing our two applications to pass data to one another on production. I ran into some CORS issues that consumed too much time and resulted in a final rush to complete the full funcitonality.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> I really liked that the challenge covered most everything we have learned at Turing. It was really cool to see the final culmination of all our hardwork come together in one project. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> Not having very much experience with CORS, the problem was tricky to trouble shoot. Once I was able to identify it, I used the docs for the gem 'cors-rack' to configure my applications in such a way that they were able to pass data between them.

* What did you learn?
> I learned that I don't perform terribly well underpressure. Specically, I dont trouble shoot well in a time sensitive situation. The added wait of need to finish on time is very distracting to my thought process. Also, after diving back into JQuery, I have learned that I much prefer React, for manipulating the DOM, even though I know I have much learn about it as a technology. I prefer its organizational structure as it helps me compartmentalize my implementations.

## Quantified Self

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> The biggest technical challenge was learning to write JavaScript as the project evolved. By the time we learned about classes and refactoring, our code base was such a  tangled mess of functions that it was very difficult to unpack into single responsiblity entities. Had we gone into the project with a better understanding  of JavaScript, our overall architecture would have been much cleaner and eaiser to refactor as our application grew.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> We were able to refactor some of our logic out of some massive functions but on the whole, given the timeline, our project was left in state that could benefit from a day of refactoring. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> Though some of our functions were messy, it was really fun to just write as much code as was needed in order to complete a feature. In this way it was sort of liberating and really helped me gain a familiarity with JavaScript as a language.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
> In this project, I learned how to build an api using a node/Express backend. I learned how to consume the endpoints from a front-end application and lastly, I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
> One thing I would change would be to take the time and better consider the architecture of our front-end application. Instead we just wrote features as required to get through our user stories. Better understanding each feature from the beginning would have given us a conceptual framework to develop within, improving the quality of our codebase.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
> It was awesome. It was great to have someone to brainstorm with when I got stuck and to have someone hold me accontable for my learning. We collabored very well the whole time and produced a very functional application. 

## Capstone Project

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> The biggest technical challenge was around the infrastructure for authenticating a user with a node/express backend and React frontend. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> In order to solve this problem, I consulted the frontend curriculum and worked through a Tutorial that outlined how to use JSON Web Tokens as a tool for authentication. This mostly covered the implementation on the client side but I still needed to work out the implementation server side. For this, I consulted many online tutorials and eventually my mentor. By the time I worked with me mentor, I had implemented a solution but he helped me clean it up to a more maintainable state.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> This challenge was super fun because it forced me to take a deeper dive learning about Express middleware. Because I have a handrolled authentication implementation, I know fundamentally understand it much better.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
> The three technical concepts I have learned during this project include, server side implementation of authentication, client side implementation (storing JWT's in local memory), learing to implement a React frontend, and the advatages of having both a staging and final master application up and running in production.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

> This mod I interviewed for a TA position at Turing. I didn't end up with the job but receive some really valuable feedback regarding my interview. It is as follows
  * I think your personality is going to get you really, really far in the job hunt. If I could give you any feedback from your interview, I'd say maybe look for more concrete examples for answers to questions that allow you to speak to what the interviewer is looking for with more authority. If you're not sure what the interviewer is looking for, you can always ask follow up questions. Also, try speaking less about things you haven't experienced or don't know and more about what you have/do know. There's so much to highlight, so it's not worth throwing anything less than positive in (unless they're looking for that).

> This was great feedback and is something I have reflected on for some time. In future interviews, something I will be acutely aware of, is to be able to provide concrete examples regarding my answer to the question. This will keep me on topic, and with a concrete example, give me something to expand on further enriching my response. 

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

> Planning a Gear Up session was a super fun experience. I enjoyed collaborating with members of frontend mod 4 and it was really cool to rally around something we were all interested in. The process of breaking up our idea into group discussion topics required us to produce our own opinions around the topic during both scheduled work times we ended up going over because we were so involved in our conversation. As an aside, the pre-alloted work time was super beneficial and as a result we produced something we were proud of. The most challenging aspect of the leading the gear up, for me was standing up in front of a class and facilitating conversation. At times, usually asking the group a question, there was a lengthy awkward silence. That being said as the gear up went on, the class became much more engaged and the conversation was flowing. As for the most rewarding part, we received many compliments on our topic of choice and everyone seemed to enjoy our Gear Up.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
> This innning I was an active member of our posse group. I helped to faciliate a group mentality of support across all of the mods included in our posse. We used our time to ask/answer questions and vent about our frustrations that arose throughout the week. Additionally, I helped to lead coding challenges and arrange discussions around best practices and tecniques. I believe community involvement is a requirement of the Turing experience becuase for many of us, Turing consumes our life for 7 months. During this time it is very important to make the Turing space a place of community and be able to exercise our personalities in this context. Without it, Turing would be all the more challenging and in my opinion far less enjoyable.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
> Moving forward the three skills I will take to my next job will be; the set of had skills I have learned during my time at turing, the ability to pair with another developer in order to produce effective and timely results, and lastly the ability to learn something that is very difficult to uderstand. The last one, I believe, will take me the farthest and is my most prized skill that I will take with me when I leave Turing.
