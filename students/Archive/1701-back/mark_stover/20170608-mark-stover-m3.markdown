# \<Mark Stover> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \<This mod I set out to learn more about creating and consuming API's. It was also my hope to help solidify my understand of SQL and Active Record queries. I gained loads of understanding in both areas.>

## Self-Assessment

>* \<My take away from this module will be the importance of creating and consuming API's. It seems likely that, as a backend developer, my professional work will require these skills.>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/stovermc/APICurious)**
>* \<This Project uses Github's api to recreate a logged in user's view of their profile page.>
>* \<It took awhile for me to dial in my postman queries but once I gained proficiency, the application really came together. I really enjoyed breaking logic into poro's to handle the API requests.>


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/stovermc/rales_engine)**
>* \<In this project, we used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.>
>* \<This was one of my favorite projects so far. Combining the business intelligence with the MVC cycle really helped solidify some concepts for me. Also, the SQL queries for the BI were really fun to come up with - one of my best late nights at Turing.>

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/stovermc/punstartr)**
>* \<In this project, we built a clone of Dropbox from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins)>
>* \<The sheer volume of work needed to be done in order to create an MVP was a bit overwhelming. I really enjoyed the early discussions regarding general app architecture and database schema considerations. This being the largest team I have been on, it was neat to see the high volume of code produced in two week sprint.>

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/stovermc/grab_bag)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<This project felt most similar to what I imagine my professional day to day to be like. It was really interesting inheriting a code base and working to identify the decisions that were made architecturally. Already having a working code base allowed us the opportunity to take deeper dives into technologies we haven't typically had time for in the past. It was a really nice change of pace and I learned a lot from this experience.>

> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
\<* Really nice work with an unfamiliar topic!>
\<* Would like to see more of a stretch to test the message controller and/or at least validations on the new models.>
\<* Quite a few unused else statements. Some small refactoring but overall, nice job!>

> Cloney Island Sprint 2 evaluation comments:
\<Presently N/A. Will update when appropriate.>

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Micro-aggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
\<This gear up has made me continue to consider the implications of my remarks through the lens of intent vs. impact. I feel I would never consciously make a remark to offend someone, though it is certainly possible that my comments may come off as a micro aggression. I feel it is especially important to be self aware in a group setting.>

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
\<I think diversity quotas are important for combating a large collective bias, though, sometimes can feel like they miss the point at an individual level. I feel that because of the large scale nature of collective bias, tools of a similar large scale are required to combat it, in this case, diversity quotas.>

> [What Would You Do for a Like](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
\<Often, I feel, that people forget just how much time, energy and money is poured into making them use their smartphones. Facebook has hundreds of engineers working to get them to spend as much time as possible on their app. I think people rarely hold this perspective and because of it, become susceptible to the many psychological hacks used to keep peoples attention. >


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<I have served my second term as a SAB rep. I feel this inning our retros were really well facilitated and produced productive conversations. We celebrated our wins and continued to find ways to improve as a cohort and as a greater community.)>

#### **Posse**
  >* \<During this inning, the Turing labs posse spent most of its time working with the 3d printer. It was fun to see the software used to generate the g-code used to "drive" the printing head.>
  >* \<I really enjoyed being able to create a tangible object. We made fidget toys and it was cool to be able to play around with them.>
  >* \<My time with Turing labs has helped me feel more comfortable approaching problems that lie outside of my skill set. I feel this will help me professionally when I come across technologies that I am unfamiliar by giving me the confidence to approach the problem with a healthy enthusiasm.>

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<I have made it a point to make friends outside of our mod in hopes of stitching the Turing community closer together.>
