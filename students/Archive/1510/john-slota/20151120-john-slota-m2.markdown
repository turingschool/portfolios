# John Slota - Module: 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

My goal this module was to learn about web apps and Ruby on Rails. I have a overreaching goal of obtaining employment in the crypto currency community.

### Attendance

I missed class November 2nd due to illness.

### Notes

* comfortable creating data for testing (users and plays)
* able to create both model and migration from command line
* able to predict error messages
* make sure to read error messages completely (spelling errors, uninitialized constant UsersController)
* don't rely so much on copy/paste (test setup, within, inheritance from application controller, initial view setup)
* comfortable with "Rails golden path": making controller, adding action, making view, defining instance variable in controller
* fast workflow
* comfortable using save_and_open_page for debugging
* able to use binding.pry to figure out that objects were not in the database
* comfortable creating iterations correctly in view


* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking - 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library - 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

* Rails Syntax & API - 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

* Rails Style - 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

* Testing 3: - Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

* Collaboration - 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## Work

### Team Projects

Below is a list of all projects and their scores for Module: 2.

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

In this project, my partners and I built a web traffic tracking and analysis tool using Ruby, Sinatra and ActiveRecord.

#### Assessed By: Rachel

#### Notes

Notes: Controller has more logic than desirable. Particularly "get "/sources/:identifier/events/:event_name"". Logic could have been separated more with POROS. Too many instance variables in the controller, but no logic in views. Needs to utilize more active record. Too much ruby enumerables.

#### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 2
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

## Slota's Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/slota-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Production URL](https://young-harbor-1645.herokuapp.com)

In this assignment we were asked to build an e-commerce site. Shannon, John and I chose to create a commercial chip store.

#### Feedback from Peers

* "There is no way to describe what it’s like to be on a team project with Slota. His enthusiasm and friendliness keep energy up and stress low. His jokes keep you laughing. His willingness to tackle busywork (like cleaning up hound requests) is beyond helpful. And his ideas and insight are beyond valuable. We truly had a Little Shop power team and Slota was a big part of the reason for that. Thank you!!"

* "John was an awesome teammate during Idea Box. He consistently made an effort to make sure that we would be turning in a quality project. He was willing to work as long as needed to ensure the project would get done. He displayed excellent communication skills throughout the project so that we were always on the same page. John was an awesome person to work with. He is also an absolute legend, and I've declared him the official mascot of Turing."

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* I have continued to lead a crypto currency club where we were able to meet start up founders.
* Participated in a welcoming group for refugees of Africa

## Review

### Notes


### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
