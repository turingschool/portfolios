# John Slota - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

* In Mod 4 I was excited to learn JavaScript, in doing so I now realize there is a ton more to learn. I also wanted to continue my interest in bitcoin but I ended up in joining Pahlka posse and working with a team to better the world.

## End of Module Assessment

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slota/final)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

* Total Points: 51 / 120

## Attendance

I believe I had perfect attendance this module.

## Team Projects

### GameTime - Turing Invaders

* [GitHub URL](http://shannonpaige.github.io/turing-invaders/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this project, we (Shannon Paige and John Slota) recreated Space Invaders. I learned a ton about JavaScript from doing so. We created increasing difficulty as you played the game which I thought made it really fun.

* Total Points: 263 / 300

## Individual Projects :

### RealTime - Live Polling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slota/real-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

In this project, I was to utilize WebSockets to create a polling app which was capable of updating and displaying results in real time. I was very happy with my overall implementation, but definitely did not push myself as hard as in the previous projects. This was partly due to fatigue resulting from the entirety of Turing, and partly due to attempting to job hunt simultaneously.

* Total Points: 161 / 200

### Scale Up - Box Trot - Background Workers

* [Blog on project](https://medium.com/@john.slota/building-rake-tasks-within-rake-tasks-b38cbfc6322#.jyypf0ec5)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)

For this week, I was on a development team working on a production code base. I was able to implement a background worker which I had not done before and rebase commits. Additionally I helped set up more testing with Marlo for the project.

* Total Points: 135 / 150

## Feedback

### Shannon Paige Feedback:

* Slota, Slota, Slota. What can be said about the man, the myth, the legend. When Mod 4 started, I found myself getting overly stressed, so when I realized we could pick partners for Game Time, I knew I had to work with Slota. He is the only person at Turing who ALWAYS has a smile on his face, and can always make me laugh. Since we had paired together during Little Shop, I knew we worked well together. We have a perfect balance, because he keeps me from getting to serious and I keep him focused. I joke that I’m just going to follow Slota around, but I really would love it if we ended up working together. I am blessed to have been in two cohorts with this crazy crazy dude.

### Edgar Duran Feedback:

* Slota has always been a great resource for me to bounce ideas off or when I am having trouble grasping a concept. I have frequently approached him when I am stuck on a problem after talking it out and receiving feedback from Slota I always leave with an answer or approach to solving a problem. But, perhaps most notably, having Slota as a team mate and friend has been on of the great gems throughout my career at Turing. We have been through much together and I feel privileged to call him my friend. I know that wherever he ends up he will find success because of his skills, positive attitude, and overall awesome character. Thanks for the memories, my friend.

### Hector Huertas Feedback:

* I want to work in the same company as John. He makes things fun and easy. I haven’t done a full project with him this module, but when we discussed about code in game time I could feel the same joy as in the pivot. We didn’t have many conversations like that in the pivot, considering the pros and cons of a given path, and I really like him thinking about tradeoffs before starting to crush features. I miss working with him. As constructive feedback, he could sometimes be more aware of when someone is not up to jokes and needs some ‘calm’ to recharge the batteries. I’m keeping one thing from him that I love: Let’s goooOOOOOOooooOOOOO!!!!

### Beth Sebian:

* Feedback for portfolios: John's been a treat to work with in Pahlka posse and share a cohort with these past two modules. He is a genuine, easy-to-get-along-with guy, who strikes a nice balance of nerdiness about our work and high standards where it matters with a lightness that makes him fun and enjoyable to work with. I'm excited to be in this field in large part because of the opportunities I'll have to work with people like John.

### Jordan Lawler

* "I had the privilage of working with Uncle-Slota on Refactor Tractor. For those of you who do not know what refactor-tractor is, it is on of the most grueling projects here at Turing. I would have not made it throug without Slota's detirmination, good spirit, and insight into how to not pass too many arguments into a javascript function. Everytime we would hit a brick wall, I would channel my inner 'lets gooooooo' and we would push through.  When it was all said and done, our pull request to the refactor tractor lesson was so good, Meeka merged it without even knowing it. I think she thought it was written by an instructor it was so perfect."
