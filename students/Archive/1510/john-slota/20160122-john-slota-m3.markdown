# (John Slota) - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission is to obtain a position in crypto currencies. With that being said, I'd like to become extremely efficient at building internal apis and consuming external apis.

### Attendance
I believe I had perfect attendance this module

### Final Assessment
(Evaluation Comments)
* delete method doesn't work for API (destroy an item) - reason is protect from forgery set to exception instead of null session
* single search works
* multi search doesn't work correctly (but doesn't crash)
* pretty good attempt at the search service
* would benefit from better naming within the product class.
* Nice use of classes, splitting things out into objects
* tested all functionality

(Scores)
1. Ruby Style and Syntax: 3
2. Rails Syntax & API: 4
3. Testing: 4
4. Progression/Completion: 3
5. Workflow: 3

### Self Directed Project
* [GitHub URL](htttps://github.com/slotaj/legislators)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md]

SCORES:
Instructor: Josh Mejia
*  completion: 4
*  organization: 4
*  test-driven-development: 4
*  code-quality: 3
*  user-experience: 3
*  performance: 4  

(Evaluation Comments)
notes: Really good use of POROs. Should clean up unused files. Would be good to tackle more Javascript and performance challenges like caching and background workers.


### Work
Below are the projects I worked on this module
(Intro)

#### (Rails Engine)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/rals-engine)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md]

(Description)
Rails Engine was a project where we took in data from Sales Engine and built our own API to access the data.

(Scores)
  1. completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
  2. test-driven-development: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
  3. code-quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  4. api-design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
  5. queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

(Evaultation Comments)
Notes: Project demonstrated achievement of learning goals.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (The Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/the_pivot)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md]

(Description)
We took
(Scores)

Product and Feature Delivery
  1. Completion: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
  2. Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  3. User Experience: 2+: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
  4. Extensions: 3: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an           almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the      curriculum.

Technical Quality
  1. Test-Driven Development: 4 - close to 100% test coverage, nice balance between feature tests and unit tests.
  2. Code Quality: 3 - Views look good, models are clean, some controllers could have been abstracted out to improve readability, overall very solid.
  3. Git Workflow: 4 - Nice commit messages, worked off branches and properly used PR's.

  Client Assessor: Josh M. Technical Assessor: Lovisa

(Evaluation Comments)
Client Notes: Final product was close to being production ready. Images were broken. Got close to having barcode extension for tickets. Very solid project, there are a few opportunities to refactor but the developers have made conscious decisions about the design and implementation of their code.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I made a serious effort this module to provide feedback to the staff and others in a timely manner, I attended all group retros and posse meetings as well.

### Being a Community Member

"Your experience during the pivot helped us avoid a lot of rabbit holes along the way. You lead the charge on the back end and brought a lot of enthusiasm, too. You definitely made me feel good about my front end skills, and you had an appropriate work/life  balance when your favorite team, ever, won Super Bowl 50." - Steve Pentler

"John is the bomb! It is an unlimited source of energy. It is a real pleasure to work with him. After two weeks I was still surprised of his continuous good vibe, even in the hardest moments of the project. I truly appreciate his ability to keep the team happy and productive. On top of that, he is able to produce an insane amount of good code very fast, it is quite hard to keep up with his production rate." - Hector

"Slota has progressed so much during the course of this module. I have gone from seeing him struggle with the concepts to having him be able to help we with troubleshooting issues. I can always be confident in asking Slota to look at my code when I am having trouble figuring something out." - Edgar

### Playing a Part

- Attended Imposter Syndrome Lunch and Purchased Lunch
- Attended 1 DSA class taught by Horace
- Attended Monday morning mediation
- Attended improv
- Attended Production Improvement Lunch
- Represented Turing by attending Ruby Meetup at Pivotal
- Mentored incoming 1603 Student(Peter Springer)
- Was interviewed for Turing Podcast
