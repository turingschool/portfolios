## Hire My Tribe
[HireMyTribe](https://github.com/stevepentler/Hire-My-Tribe) on GitHub

**Aaron Greenspan, Hector Huertas, Joseph "JP" Perry & Steve Pentler**

After interviewing for an IT recruitment position, I was astounded that up to 40% of developers paychecks are cashed in by recruitment firms. Afterwards I developed a concept to connect freelance developers into "Tribes" to balance strengths and minimize culture conflicts. Hire My Tribe was born to fuse freelance devolopers and connect them to contractors.

The Hire My Tribe web application features a genetic algorithm developed by Aaron Greenspan that takes in parameters such as ideal number & type of developers, price points, language preferences, and skill ratings. It then outputs the maximal combination of developers based on this criteria.

Technically, this Rails application allows distinct access privledges as either a developer, contractor, or admin. Depending on authorization, users are allowed to view, sort, edit, update, and delete developers, projects, specializations, and tags.

I plan to continue working on this project through module three integrating API's that connect developers who have associations through LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social networks.

[Code Challenges](https://github.com/stevepentler/code_challenges) on GitHub

Opportunities to practice Ruby.
- Swift Stats inputs a csv with Taylor Swift lyrics and count's how many times lyrics are repeated, such as "truck."
- Pig Latin "latinify's" user input. 
- Italian Plumber allows users to build walls like those in Super Mario with symbols of their choice.

### Community

I've regularly attended Computability Theory on Wednesday mornings as well as Hack Design on Thursday afternoons.

I have the best eyewear in all of Turing aside from Regis. I'm a father figure for 1510, especially Jordan Lawler, who needs guidance.
___
#### Playing a Part
I've been very deliberate about helping 1511'ers. I've had consistent pairing sessions and lots of check-ins.

### Feedback *should be private*

* "Steve is so easy-going and fun to work with. He is extremely good at front-end design and displaying content in an organized and aesthetic way. He always recognizes whenever I can't reach something in the kitchen and gets it for me without asking, he is an awesome member of the Turing community. - Beth"
* "Having worked with Steve on our Little Shop end-of-module project, I can safely say that he is one of the most consistently positive people I've ever worked with. Even-tempered and cool in even the most stressful situations, Steve brings a nigh-fatherly presence that strongly contributes to group order and productivity. Steve spear-headed the CSS styling of our project, and he has excellent instincts for web design. I particularly appreciate that Steve actively engages all aspects of the design process, rather than sticking to the tasks that feel the most comfortable, or that come the most easily to him. Pressed for actionable constructive criticism, I would advise Steve to more actively manage window layout and shortcuts when pairing, a skill that I've already seen him improve on notably over the course of our project. I couldn't have asked for a better partner, and can only hope I have more opportunities to work with Steve in the future!" - JP 
* "Steve was really fun to work with on Traffic Spy. He never turns down taking on a task and did a great job with views and partials for our site. He also loves to work on the styling which some of us tend to avoid. Steve doesn't given himself enough credit for the work that he puts in and how much he is able to contribute to the group. I think if he started trusting himself a little more he would realize what a great programmer he is!" - Toni 
* "Steve, I appreciate and agree with your assessment that you are very aware of yourself and others.  Nevertheless I sometimes wonder whether your perceived self weaknesses prevent you from celebrating your strengths.  Throughout this project I have seen a number of people — from our group and from without — compliment you about how the site looks, or about the creative idea for it, or for some clever piece of code you put down.  Your response is usually something like “Thanks, but I’m actually not very good at …  << insert weakness >>.   I’m not going to tell you that you don’t have said weaknesses, or that you are lying when you qualify your acceptance of the compliment.  Instead, I want to say both that a) it makes the complimenting person uncomfortable (like when you give a gift to someone and want them to be happy but instead they say “I can’t accept this, I don’t deserve it”) and b) I wonder whether the compliment part ever actually hits home for you… whether you understand you actually ARE talented in the ways that you are (this is only negative feedback right?), or whether you so quickly jump to qualify with your weaknesses you miss the point.   This isn't something you need to work on for my or the group's sake, but something which might make your day to day as enjoyable for you as others want it to be." - Aaron
* “I am honored to share a namespace with Steve.” - Steve

### Giving Feedback *should be private*
* “JP doesn’t take shortcuts. When everyone else is getting lazy about GitHub, testing, or convention, he speaks up and defends his points. I also appreciate how he was confident enough to question the aesthetics of my design decisions and encourage me to think from a user’s perspective. When I listened, he was generally correct. I know I wouldn’t be as apt to question his design decisions on the back-end, so I admire his inquisitive nature. JP  is exceptionally easy to work with. On a few instances, he clearly communicated his needs/expectations to the group with a very palatable demeanor. I can sincerely say he is in the top three pairing partners I’ve had thus far at Turing.”
* “I am honored to share a namespace with Steve.” - Steve
* “During Traffic Spy, Beth was trailblazing topics that hadn’t been covered extensively, then happily taking the time to explain. She’s meticulous about the details, so don’t blaspheme about statistics in her presence. She’s fantastic to work with and has a smile on her face the majority of the day. I’m just a little upset she hasn’t had a tea party with me in a while.”
* “Working with Toni allows groups to spend more time exploring new topics and less time debugging. Clean and efficient is her style, and her meticulous attention to detail helped me curve my bad habits. Her motivation to attempt every extension set the tone and made me want to follow her lead. More importantly, she is very patient and willing to slow down to explain her processes. For improvement, she could be more aware of when she is talking over others. She generally has the right answers, which somewhat justifies this tendency, but being more aware will improve team dynamics. As a side note, I am very impressed with the amount of time she invests into 1511."
* "Constructive Feedback for Hector: I love your enthusiasm for the project, however when it comes to voicing opinions, I think you could work on communicating it an a less enthusiastic way. You’ve proven that your opinions are generally correct, but voicing them in a low, calculated voice is much more effective and you’re less likely to be challenged."
* "Constructive Feedback for Aaron: You’re super easy to work with, but I think you underestimate yourself and don’t feel comfortable challenging Hector/Aaron. My only suggestion is that you get more comfortable asserting your opinions - you’re an extremely talented developer."
For the record, I say you’d make an incredible professor not because of your intelligence and knack for explaining deep logic, but more because of the way you handle challenges. When the girl from 1511 challenges you in computability theory and throws down power moves, you don’t let any ego get in the way. You’re an incredible listener, even when you have the answers. You’re very appreciative of other opinions. I hope you realize nobody is trying to “expose you” and nobody would take any pleasure in seeing you fall/struggle. You’re very considerate of people below you, and that’s probably the best judge of character, and I really appreciate your patience with me thus far in the project."- Aaron
* "Constructive Feedback: You’re super easy to work with, but I think you underestimate yourself and don’t feel comfortable challenging Hector/Aaron. My only suggestion is that you get more comfortable asserting your opinions - you’re an extremely talented developer." - JP
