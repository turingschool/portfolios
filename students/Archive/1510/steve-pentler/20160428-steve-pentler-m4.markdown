### Feedback


* "It's extremely unfortunate that Steve and I never got work on an official project together at Turing. I would not have made it through Turing with the same positive attitude and zeal for being in a basement if it weren't for Steve. Beyond his sense of humor, I award Steve "Most Improved" of our cohort. Far from a bullshit ribbon on a soccer team, I mean this in the most sincere way possible. He has grown into a rockstar programmer and any company that snags him will be incredibly lucky. Badgers4Lyfe." - Brenna

* "I can’t believe I spent a module without a project with Steve!! We talked a lot during game time though, and his programming style still inspires me. He has an amazing idea, and he follows it no matter what until he makes it real. Because of this he sometimes faces hard and uncommon problems, but the result is always amazing and super creative, and the learning is huge. I’ll try to mimic that spirit in my following projects. One thing I noticed is that sometimes he takes too much time before asking for help, and sometimes all the problem needs is another couple of eyes. I’ll be following Steve work closely, it’s gonna be extraordinary! - Hector

*  "I don't think anyone in our cohort has put more hours into Turing than Steve. His drive to learn and perform is something that I have looked to for inspiration when I have hit stumbling blocks over the last two modules. Over the course of the last 7 months he became someone that just about everyone in our cohort will go to for help with one thing or another, and during this last module, Steve reached out to me numerous times offering help if I were stuck. The fact that he genuinely cares about my success is obvious, and I will be always grateful for that. Steve isn't comfortable with just getting by, he wants to do the thing well and absolutely kill it. He is doing that now, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do that." - Brant

* "Steve is so easy-going and fun to work with. He is extremely good at front-end design and displaying content in an organized and aesthetic way. He always recognizes whenever I can't reach something in the kitchen and gets it for me without asking, he is an awesome member of the Turing community. - Beth"

* "Steve. Dad. Steve. Whatever you choose to call him, this man of integrity and hard work, he brings a good vibe to the room. And a mullet. A MULLET.  which he wears it handsomely.  He is also forgiving. Why, only last week I didn’t believe his website was his. I thought he had pulled up a professional website and was pulling my leg. In reality, it was a professional website. His professional website.  I’m always impressed by his design work, both on the computer and in his hairstyle. Beyond that, he’s a well-rounded developer and, but brings no ego and is always a pleasure to be around. I’m a bit disappointed we’ve never been assigned to work on a project together.  But also I understand - a Steve sandwich just isn’t fair." - Steve O

* "Steve P is one of the best front end developers that I’ve met during my time here at Turing, without his help and working with him I doubt my front end skills would be where they are today. His dedication to his craft is uncanny. I believe the first day of the project, Hector and I spent the entire afternoon trying to build our basic views, after we were done and did our best, Steve in less than an hour created views based on our design that was far superior. His easy going personality made his teaching infectious and I can honestly say he made me a much stronger developer." - Slota

### Giving Feedback

* It was intimidating to show up to the Zyg posse on the first few days of Turing, because Dan was extremely capable and I was entering the underworld for the first time. But Dan’s generosity and genuine interest in problem solving set the tone immediately, and he carried on this tradition over the remaining seven months. Dan is exceptionally bright. I know that, he knows it, and the community has realized it. But what I really admire is how he has maintained an equal level of respect for students like myself, who will probably never return any programming favors. He’s going to be one of the most successful programmers from our cohort, and I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to bounce countless ideas off of him. I hope he finds himself in a position to create positive social change, because that’s what the world needs. Best of luck and thank you, Dan! Now go crush your interview! - Steve

* I was first paired with Hector on a four man team during Little shop, and to be completely honest he had a bit of a reputation for being opinionated and slightly difficult to work with. As the team lead at the time, I scheduled in a mandatory feedback for the first Thursday in order to correct any workflow issues prior to the second week. I gave Hector the advice that he could attempt to convey his preferences with less emotion in order to prevent defensive reactions from his teammates. Now, the thing about advice is that you can take it or leave it.Hector pulled me aside that same day because he wanted to have a genuine conversation. Rather than defending himself, he continued to ask questions from a place of self-improvement. The next week he reacted to this feedback exceptionally well. With a more constructive, less emotional tone, he avoided “clashes” (with Aaron) and the entire group’s morale for the second week was lighthearted and fun.

    After the intermission, I was reassigned to a group with Hector for the Pivot. One month straight with the “Spanish Thunder.” He crushed the project and conveyed his points with his brain instead of his heart, and there was no longer a sense of pride in being correct all the time. He was an incredible teammate, and I can guarantee that Slota (the Pivot) and Marlo(GameTime) would say the same.

    Hector’s technical abilities have never been in question, though his soft skills have. I can testify to the progress he has made, and I can sincerely say that I would love to work on a small team with Hector for years. He doesn’t take shortcuts and if I ever needed anyone to design the back end of a project, no joke I would hit up Hector first.

    The entirety of 1510 is bummed that he couldn’t be with use these final weeks, but he’s as much a part of the cohort as any of us who are still standing at graduation. I wish nothing but the best for him, and hope our paths cross again (preferably in Europe for a UEFA Champions League game). Speaking of which, did you see  Ñíguez’s goal? “EM-PAW-SEE-BALL!!!!” jaja

* To think that Brant almost took a module off and left 1510 is hard to believe at this point. He’s nearly the heart and soul of the cohort, and has formed some of the strongest relationships with a multitude of people in the cohort. He genuinely cares about everyone in 1510 and is perhaps the most well-liked individual in the group. I really admire how he has reinvented himself as a “yes man.” At first he was a bit closed off to the group and took a very mature approach to Turing. Then he opened up, started singing karaoke, and initiated a chain reaction. The world is much better because of it. I really hope that he is able to locate a job where he is able to connect with nature, as it seems to be a very centering force in his life. I expect that we’ll get in some spectacular hikes and camping over the summer, and I really look forward to it. Finally, I apologize for calling you “old.” You’re actually a very youthful, kind, dirty old bastard. Aside from personal stuff, he is one of my favorite people to pair with. His work ethic is off the charts, and his work flow is smooth. He discontent without understanding and rarely takes shortcuts, which keeps a lot of us in check. We entered module 3 with a pact that we were going to get through it together and not make a lot of noise in the process, and here we are graduating 4. It feels like a very shared accomplishment. Congrats!

* Feedback for Brenna: “Brenna  cares! She is more approachable and generous with her time than anyone in 1510. At times, I’ve borderline abused her as a sounding board and she continues to respond to my sorry cries for help. And when she helps, her ability to articulate her thought process always impresses me. She is the force that keeps 1510 in balance, but don’t tell her that because she’s too humble to accept compliments. In terms of front-end design, she has almost single-handedly kept 1510’s views afloat. When people have a simple styling question, they consult me. When they have a complex styling question, they know who to talk to. I’m extremely happy that she is sticking around Turing. I have no doubt that she is going to nail the TA position and keep our cohort close and involved.  In terms of constructive feedback, I’m angry about two things. The first is that she is legendary at keeping friends out drinking past their bedtime, which is bad for my health. The second is that she’s so damn old, only because we couldn’t experience the Russell Wilson year at Wisconsin together. Roll Badge.

* Steve-O, the king of laid-backness, also happens to be the innovator of 1510. If you watch the group, you’ll notice that he’s generally the one to pioneer a new skill. More importantly, he is overly-generous with his time and is one of the most approachable characters in 1510. His Reddit and Google skills will serve him well in the future, and I mean that seriously. Finally, have you noticed his style? One particular day he wore boots, short denim? shorts, and a cut neck hoodie. The future is Steve, and I am honored to share a namespace with this fine gentleman. Now let's graduate and get some bolo-ties!
