### My Mission - Mod 1

I came to Turing to become an even better version of myself.

More specifically, I am here to learn as much as I can from as many people as I can - technically, intellectually, and socially. I am here to push myself into situations that I don't usually find comfortable. Even more specifically for Module 1, I want to be comfortable applying Ruby to solve a variety of different problems in different situations, and I want this experience to be able to springboard me into learning new programming languages.

I feel like I have met these goals through Module 1, but I still see opportunities to push myself further and expand this mission.
___

### My Mission - Mod 2

I enter Mod 2 with a small amount of experience with Rails. I would like to not only reinforce my level of knowledge, but also gain a deeper understanding of how things work in Rails. I also would like to have a better understanding of db tables and how they interact through the various relationships.

I have met these goals, however I feel like I did not take advantage of a few opportunities where I could have branched out to gain an even deeper understanding of Rails.

### Giving Feedback

To Aaron Greenspan - "Aaron and I chose to pair on the ruby project, Event Manager, over the winter break. Working with Aaron was a pleasure. He has a high energy level and is enthusiastic about things, even when he isn't necessarily excited about doing them. Aaron kept me engaged throughout the hours that we paired together and was fun to work with. Last module I gave Aaron specific feedback that at times his confidence can come off as intimidating to others. I have not witnessed that happen during this module, and I believe that Aaron's awareness around this has translated into personal growth."

To Dan Winter - "Dan was a solid Project Manager on our Traffic Spy project. He has good vision of where the project is currently and where it ultimately needs to go. One suggestion for Dan is to be aware of how headstrong he is. He has strong opinions about how he things something can be implemented, and some people may interpret his enthusiasm for his ideas as a lack of flexibility. Dan often solves problems faster than others; being aware of this and helping others to the solution is a great way of continuing to build his already solid leadership skills."

To Steve Oscaro - "Steve was a great team member to have for Traffic Spy. He is flexible with his work style, but also has clear opinions and goals. Steve has a forthright and upfront communication style which is great to have on a team project. Steve should continue this approach, not only in DTRs with future teams, but throughout the projects as well."

To Jamie Crockett - "Jamie has been great to work with for the last two weeks - (Rails Mini-Project and Little Shop). He enjoys solving problems and this enthusiasm spills over to the rest of the team. When Jamie arrives at a solution before others, he makes sure that everyone gets caught up before moving on to the next issue. Jamie and I have talked about how we are both VERY flexible when working with a team. This is a great trait to have, and I understand where he is coming from (because I approach projects from a similar perspective), but I encourage Jamie to bring it up during future DTRs with other teams so that everyone is aware of it, and that its not interpreted as a lack of desire to work on the project."

To Penney Gadget - "Penney is a wonderful person to have on a project. Her positive energy seeps into everything that she works on. She seems to be much more comfortable with her place at Turing and with her skills now that she has moved through Module 2, although there are still times that her confidence lags behind her skills. I encourage Penney to remember that she can do it and __IS DOING IT__! Penney is a programmer!"

### Being a Community Member

"Brant has really come into his own this module.  During our pairing on the EventReporter mini-project, Brant was excited to make his ideas come to fruition and certainly wasn’t waiting for me to come up with a solution.  The collaboration overall was incredibly productive and was an incredibly fun time.  Though I didn’t work with him during LittleShop, he seems by all accounts to be filling his leadership role (as the group leader) easily and with good results.  When Brant isn’t feeling the pressure, he’s easy going, quick thinking, and fast to laugh; I really look forward to pairing with him on a more major project.  Now, he won’t let me off with all this nice-nice stuff, so let me also say this: In the ongoing balancing act between self-improvement and self-acceptance, in my opinion anyways, Brant way overemphasizes the former at the expense of the latter.  More concretely, I think Brant has a hard time seeing the positive impact he has on the students and community of Turing, because he spends a lot of time looking for and picking at his own weaknesses.  The most important thing for Brant to work on in the future is NOTHING, or rather, the most important thing is for Brant to be OK with himself, and to let in the good vibes so many of us try to send him." - Aaron Greenspan
 * Solid advice from Aaron that I am going to think about and consider.

"Brant is great to work with. He’s a good communicator, easy and fun to work with, and always willing to help out. I have learned so much from working with him and really look forward to collaborations in the future. Truly I feel I’ve made a friend and ally in Brant, and I can tell that a lot of other people have also. Moving on to module 3, I would caution him to not let stress take over - sometimes he doubts his skills when things get intense, but he knows the material and is masterful at puzzling through tough issues." - Penney Gadget  
 * Confidence! Confidence! I'm continuing to work on this issue and try to learn to trust myself better.

“Brant was an ideal teammate on the Traffic Spy project - very easy to work with, good at communicating suggestions and corrections, and willing to put in lots of hours when necessary. He has a good understanding of how to build a Rails app, as well as front end implementation. I hope to be paired with him again on a project." - Steve Oscaro

"Brant is great partner to have on a project because he is focused, knowledgeable and fun to be around. Brant’s determination to do well and learn pushes the rest of the team towards those same goals. At times, it seems like Brant doesn’t speak up because he isn’t 100% sure about something but the reality is, none of us are 100% sure about anything programming related. If he were to voice opinions a bit more and a bit more strongly, it would help his team better clarify their vision." - Dan Winter
 * Speak up more...I like it! And I'm going to work on that.

“Brant has been one of my favorite partners to work with. He really enjoys the TDD process and that fosters a positive pairing experience. He takes pride in practicing doing things the right way, and that has helped me learn proper techniques for merging branches and resolving merge conflicts. My biggest suggestion for Brant is to realize some of his old weaknesses might now be strengths. In our "DTR" talks he would often pre-warn the group of some bad habits, only to find he was the best in the group at holding everyone accountable for those. I believe he is more capable of taking on more of a leadership role than he gives himself credit for." - Jamie Crockett
 * More of the "leadership" advice....I'm continuing to take it seriously and develop it and step into that role.

### Playing a Part

* This has been the second module that I have been a member of the Student Advisory Board. I tried to take a slightly different approach to my involvement this module - more of a leadership perspective. Knowing that I would be rotating off at the end of the module, I have tried to inspire Brenna to be involved in the group so she could take on the leadership role next module. I have sent out weekly surveys to gather feedback from our cohort to take back to the team to discuss.

* In addition to being on SAB, I tried to take on the task of modifying the format of our weekly Group Retros so that they were more productive and challenging to our cohort. There are few (zero) conflicts within our cohort, so I saw this as an opportunity to encourage individuals to grow more.

* I made myself available to a number of people from 1511, and made it clear that I was available and willing to assist them in any way possible.

* I took on the role of 1511 "buddy" with Chelsea. I met with her a couple of times and went out to lunch with a group of other "buddies" to make sure that she was welcomed to the school and transitioned well during her first few weeks.

* I have actively created relationships beyond my cohort and have encouraged others to do the same when I see that they seem to be isolating themselves.
