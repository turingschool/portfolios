# Brant Wellman - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission - Mod 1

I came to Turing to become an even better version of myself.

More specifically, I am here to learn as much as I can from as many people as I can - technically, intellectually, and socially. I am here to push myself into situations that I don't usually find comfortable. Even more specifically for Module 1, I want to be comfortable applying Ruby to solve a variety of different problems in different situations, and I want this experience to be able to springboard me into learning new programming languages.

I feel like I have met these goals through Module 1, but I still see opportunities to push myself further and expand this mission.
___

### My Mission - Mod 2

I enter Mod 2 with a small amount of experience with Rails. I would like to not only reinforce my level of knowledge, but also gain a deeper understanding of how things work in Rails. I also would like to have a better understanding of db tables and how they interact through the various relationships.

I have met these goals, however I feel like I did not take advantage of a few opportunities where I could have branched out to gain an even deeper understanding of Rails.
___

### My Mission - Mod 3

Entering Mod 3, I feel fairly comfortable working with Rails, but I would like to become comfortable with integrating APIs with that knowledge. I would like to do something for my personal project that will be interesting, fun, and provide some some key piece of learning, and also still be of some use to a set of people. I would also like to continue to use my leadership skills to guide individuals in the cohort and others outside the cohort in the Turing community.
___

### My Mission - Mod 4

JavaScript! Entering Mod 4 I had not used JS to any large degree at all in my previous projects. I wanted to come out of the module comfortable making AJAX calls, building applications with JS, and integrating JS into Rails applications - all while not making a complete fool of myself. I'm feel good about all of those goals...with the potential exception of the last one.

### Giving Feedback

To "Dad" Steve Pentler - "I don't think anyone in our cohort has put more hours into Turing than Steve. His drive to learn and perform is something that I have looked to for inspiration when I have hit stumbling blocks over the last two modules. Over the course of the last 7 months he became someone that just about everyone in our cohort will go to for help with one thing or another, and during this last module, Steve reached out to me numerous times offering help if I were stuck. The fact that he genuinely cares about my success is obvious, and I will be always grateful for that. Steve isn't comfortable with just getting by, he wants to do the thing well and absolutely kill it. He is doing that now, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do that."  

To Penney Gadget - "I remember first meeting Penney during Module 1 and immediately being drawn to her sense of calm and wisdom that she brought to the group. I feel very lucky to have been able to watch Penney's growth through the course of the 4 modules that we were together. Her personal struggle with believing in herself has actually been one of the more inspiring things to witness during the last 7 months. There have been clear times that it was obvious that her struggle was real, but Penney owned that struggle, faced it head on and learned what she wanted/needed to learn. Her determination to succeed is something that I hope incorporate in my own life."

To Beth C - "Stress and worry! That's exactly how I started my feedback to Beth for Module 3. However, I've seen a change this module with how Beth handles these situations. She freaks out (per normal), but quickly brings it under control and uses this stress to drive her forward, learn what she needs to, and build out what she is looking to do. Then she starts yelling at all of us, insulting us, and calling us idiots. And we love it. And we love her. Beth's programming and debugging skills are spot on. I can't even remember the number of times that I have chosen to go to her to help me figure out a problem. Not only do I have confidence that she is going to help me resolve the problem, but I know that she is also going to help me learn about it in the process."

To B-renna Martenson - “Turing made the right decision when they decided to hire Brenna as a TA. When she is helping another student, not only does she truly care about helping that person understand what it is they are talking about, but also that she understands the concepts they are talking about. A number of times I've been that person being helped by Brenna, and I've experienced her empathy for others, and this is going to help her excel at teaching others at Turing. On the personal side, Brenna has been an unfailing source of support for me as I've gone through emotional hardships over the last 5 months. I can say without hesitation that I would not have gotten through Turing without her."

To Double-A Greenspan - "Aaron hates to hear me ask for personal growth from myself or others...but I have seen an amazing amount of personal growth from him. He genuinely listens to feedback and makes real change. His desire for growth is remarkable. As for coding...well, he's good. He knows he's good. But that doesn't matter, because he is more interested in applying his skills in ways that continue to push his envelope. He isn't interested in completing something that he thinks is half-assed. I love talking with him about a project or idea, because he continues to dream the project bigger and bigger until it seems like something that is unattainable. But then he goes out and kills it. It is truly inspirational. He's also an ok human being who has been my rock throughout Turing, and I'm eternally grateful for that."

 “To think that Brant almost took a module off and left 1510 is hard to believe at this point. He’s nearly the heart and soul of the cohort, and has formed some of the strongest relationships with a multitude of people in the cohort. He genuinely cares about everyone in 1510 and is perhaps the most well-liked individual in the group. I really admire how he has reinvented himself as a “yes man.” At first he was a bit closed off to the group and took a very mature approach to Turing. Then he opened up, started singing karaoke, and initiated a chain reaction. The world is much better because of it. I really hope that he is able to locate a job where he is able to connect with nature, as it seems to be a very centering force in his life. I expect that we’ll get in some spectacular hikes and camping over the summer, and I really look forward to it. Finally, I apologize for calling you “old.” You’re actually a very youthful, kind, dirty old bastard. Aside from personal stuff, he is one of my favorite people to pair with. His work ethic is off the charts, and his work flow is smooth. He discontent without understanding and rarely takes shortcuts, which keeps a lot of us in check. We entered module 3 with a pact that we were going to get through it together and not make a lot of noise in the process, and here we are graduating 4. It feels like a very shared accomplishment. Congrats!"  
  -- From Dad Steve Pentler

 “I feel personally really fortunate that I got to be in the same class as Brant and have this crazy experience alongside him. He is the rock of 1510 in many ways, the one person I, and many others, know they can always depend upon, whether it be for technical or emotional support. Brant is always willing to lend a patient ear and make time for whatever a friend may need. If I get to work with someone a fraction as wonderful as him out in the real world, I will have won. I hope he realizes, as he sets foot out into the job force, that he is an excellent developer and will be a huge asset to whatever team he ends up working with."  
 -- From Penney Gadget

 "I could not have gotten through Turing without Brant. He helped me countless times get through my doubts and worries and was so incredibly supportive. I've given him the same damn feedback every module (blah blah blah stop worrying), so here's something new: stop freaking out whenever I run over your foot. Time to get over it and get an ice pack while I laugh maniacally."  
 -- From Beth C

 "I’m going 4 mods deep on Brant feedback here.  Let’s recap the main points from the previous three: I like Brant; Brant should trust in his abilities more; Brant is really supportive of others in our cohort.  New stuff: I like Brant more; Brant is more trusting in his abilities; Brant’s become a total pit of dark and brutal disregard for the feelings of others and has led to ashen tears of countless coding colleagues.  Just kidding.  He knows the respect and care I have for him, and here is not the place to put it."  
 -- From Double-A Greenspan

 -__Self Reflection:__ A common theme from 4 modules of feedback has been for me to trust my skills more - be more confident in what it is that I can accomplish. In Module 3 I started tackling this head-on. Things were still very difficult, but I tackled my challenges head on, knowing that I would be able to figure them out and get through them successfully. This carried into Module 4, which again was very difficult, but in different ways. I just simply knew that I would be able to figure things out, somehow, and move on to the next challenge. I plan on carrying that forward into my career...as things won't really change at all, in terms of me needing to learn and figure things out.

### Playing a Part

* This module I was asked to take on a role of co-leader of a Posse. I joined with Scott Firestone to form a new group focused on supporting other students in their daily work and projects. We had scheduled meetings 4 times per week, most of which were focused on helping each other and forming bonds across cohorts. I was the only student in the posse from 1510, and there are a number of students in 1511 in the posse, which should make it easy to keep the group together and pass on leadership skills down to the next cohorts.

* I haven't had the "formal" role of leader within our cohort, but I have continued to take more of a role of a "silent" leader. I have been active about talking to the group through individual interactions - trying to reach out to everyone over the course of the module. I have tried to be someone that others are comfortable approaching to talk about issues they may be having as an individual or with the group - and this is the impression I've been trying to give to everyone outside of 1510 as well.
