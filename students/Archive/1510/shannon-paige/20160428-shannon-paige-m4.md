### Your Mission

Finish Turing!! But seriously, my main concern going into mod 4 was to finish strong, while keeping
the peace and stress free existence I had honed during my second time in Mod 3. And to continue to push
myself. I am so happy to have been a part of 1510, because they have encouraged me to reach outside of
my comfort zone a little more every day.

### Attendance

I missed 1 day due to do dealing with a crazy huge tax bill.

## Community

### Being a Community Member

From Charissa:
One of the unexpected bonuses of my time spent here at Turing has been to become friends with Shannon. She has not been just a person to gripe about stress over coffee, but she has honestly helped me get through some of my toughest challenges here.  I am someone who probably wouldn’t ask for help unless it is a last resort, but Shannon has helped me change that attitude.  In my opinion she is one of the best developers that I have seen go through this school. However, she does not approach code problems that I ask her about with the type of attitude that might come with that. She takes the time to walk through code challenges with me as a team effort. I did not expect to make a friend like her here… intelligent, honest, and sincere… not just to me but to anyone that comes to her for guidance. Companies would be smart to begin a bidding war for her employment… I’m confident that she will be fast to rise to the top of the developer world.

From Edgar:
Having Shannon in my cohort during the entirety of my Turing career has been a true blessing. Shannon has helped me get through problems so many times that I can not even count them. Her willingness to lend a hand at any time is what has made her one of my go to people anytime I have any trouble. I am confident that she will be an excellent developer and an asset to any company that hires her. More than anything I am lucky to call Shannon my friend.

From Jamie:
Shannon is my kind of partner. She's super laid back, doesn't get overly stressed about things working or not working, and just plugs away and writes awesome features. She spearheaded our push into HTML5 drag-and-drop, paying no heed to the ominous warnings from our instructors. She cracks jokes and remains patient and positive while working through complex issues, rarely showing signs of frustration. Constructively, there were a couple days where XYZ came up and we ended up not being able to pair and get as much done as we might have hoped. Shannon (and me, by the way) could be more mindful when it comes to communicating those scheduling issues and setting expectations for what would or would not get done. Personally her style is a great fit for me and didn't phase me one bit, I like to go with the flow, but I can think of other partners I've had who might have been stressed out by the work flow during the first couple days of our electron project.

From Slota:
I saved Shannon’s feedback for last. Shannon and I are ride and dies. We have started Turing together and we will end it together. I consider Shannon one of my good friends. She is a hard worker, super smart and easy going at the same time. I paired with her at Turing on Slota’s Chips and Turing Invaders and both times we absolutely knocked it out of the park. I really think that was because of her leadership and hard work. She’s also a leader I would like to add. She created the imposter syndrome lunch at Turing that I attended and believe will continue after she’s gone. That took a lot of courage as its not easy to admit that you have those feelings and want to start a group around it. I might add so that hopefully Jeff reads this, she bought around $200 of pizza for the group and has not asked for reimbursement. She should probably get something awesome for this from Jeff Casimir. I don’t know what else I can say about Shannon, she’s super awesome, I hope we get jobs together, but regardless of her path she’s going to be super successful and she was super successful before coming to Turing. I hope one day I can be as awesome as her. The only thing I have to say negatively about her is that her golf game is garbage and she is going to go down hard if we ever play our scotch game. Lolz just kidding but I can’t wait!!

#### Playing a Part

* I ran the "imposter lunch" group, for students who are suffering from imposter syndrome.
* I attended LGBT and Joan Clarke community events.
* I acted as a Gear-Up facilitator.
