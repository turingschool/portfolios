# Shannon Paige - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
Although I passed mod 3 the first time, I decided to repeat so that I could
strengthen my skills, while having time to explore other areas of development.
My goal for this module is to better understand the ambiguity of API consumption,
and to learn better testing techniques (specifically VCR and rspec).

### Attendance

From Taylor "Before Mod 3, I didn't really know Shannon. So I didn't know what to expect starting a 2 week project with her. I couldn't have been happier with an outside source. She killed the Jquery we worked on together and she is a design genius. I loved working with her because she not only had great communication but considered all options. I'm excited to see where Shannon goes and look forward to working with her again."
