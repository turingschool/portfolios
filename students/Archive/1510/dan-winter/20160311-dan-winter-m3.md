# Dan Winter - Module 3 Portfolio


## Individual


### Your Mission

By the end of the module, I'd like to learn the basics of Ember and build an app.
I'd also like to come up with an awesome app for my personal project.


### End of Module Assessment

Best Buy

Assessed By: Josh

#### Notes:

* API: Index/Show/Delete works well
* Search: single and multi word search works well
* Testing is good, the items_controller_spec make assertions about the appropriate data points
* Feature test for the search is very thorough, and there are tests for both single and multi search. The feature test is making assertions about appropriate data
* In the products method in the BestBuyService, the formatting of the longDescription could be split out in a separate method. The results (latter part of method) could also be split out.
* Nice use of POROs for the Product, good use of serializers

#### Scores:

* Ruby Style & Syntax - 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical component
* Rails Syntax & API - 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing
* Rails Style - 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
* Testing - 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
* Progression/Completion - 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* Workflow - 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes and has at least 12 commits on the project

### Attendance

I have attended all classes with no absences.

## Individual Projects

#### Stache-Yo-Self
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/danjwinter/stache_yo_self)

* Really solid project. Understands core concepts for the module at an early stage.

#### Score
* Completion - 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* Test Driven Development - 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* Code Quality - 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* Api Design - 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
* Queries - 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

## Team Projects

### Freelancer For You

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danjwinter/the_pivot)

#### Notes

Technical Notes: controllers: skinny controllers, logic is properly pushed down the stack and operations are extracted out to private methods when necessary tests: very good tests :thumbsup: --- would need more model unit tests. models: nice, clean models, good use of the Presenter pattern views: presenter pattern :ok_hand:

Client Notes: Really solid product. Added maps, optional OAuth login, Emails, and a scheduler

#### Score

* Completion - 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization - 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* User Experience - 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* Extensions - 4: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Toni For The Pivot

"My favorite part of working with Toni is that she made me a better coder. She took pull requests and github workflow seriously and offered great critical feedback that pushed me to think more in depth about my design decisions and the reasons behind them. She was also always willing to help tackle a bug, talk through complex problems and teach us how to CSS. Thanks Toni!"

#### Feedback to Aaron C.

"After my mentor informed me she no longer had the time to mentor, I’ve been leaning on mod 4 for that help and Aaron stepped in to fill some of that space. Routinely, he has, with a smile, withstood my constant badgering of questions when I see him first thing in the morning, later that afternoon or late into the night. He’s helped me on a variety of projects, even when he’s in the midst of his own challenges, and has made not having a mentor doable."

##Being a Community Member

### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Toni for The Pivot

"Dan is very good at solving problems and has no problem going off on his own and using documentation to figure out a solution. I was really impressed that he got OAuth2 set up with LinkedIn basically by himself at the end of the project. I always felt comfortable when Dan took on a task because I knew he would work hard to complete it and was never worried about whether or not his code would be good. I think Dan is a valuable team member and then only thing he probably needs to improve on is his CSS skills."


#### Feedback from JP for The Pivot

"Over the course of the last three modules, Dan is one of the people that I most looked forward to grouping with for a project. Having finally had the opportunity to work with him on the Pivot, I can say that he exceeded my ample expectations. Dan is an excellent coder who excels at logical problem solving. What most impressed me about his approach though was his eagerness to dive into new problems. Many times that I found myself feeling overwhelmed or intimidated by a new feature or tool, Dan was ready to dive in head-first. He is truly unafraid to try new things, and his eagerness to explore pays off tremendously as he delivers truly innovative code. Dan is truly one of the most intellectually curious people I've ever met, and I am truly excited to see where his passion and drive carry him in years to come."


#### Feedback from Aaron G.

"Some people excel at Turing because of an innate gift.  Others because of an enduring work ethic.  Others still because of a creative spark which drives them to learn more.  Dan is one of the few people I can honestly say excels in no small way for all of these reasons.  In our short three modules together, Dan has gone from knowing little to nothing about Ruby, to knowing more about the widest array of technologies of anyone in our cohort (any cohort?). He is absolutely fearless  in the face of not knowing at all how a thing works, and it has payed off with knowing a great deal about a lot of things work. He is a personal force here at Turing and that alone would be enough to propel Dan to the top of his class and to an amazing and exciting career ahead. But, he isn’t JUST a personal force.  He has taken up a significant support role as well, fielding questions on Slack throughout the day and night regardless of what he may be doing or yet need to do for a project.  He is patient with others, thorough, and excited to see others excel.  My only constructive criticism for Dan is that we haven’t yet been able to pair on and create something wild together.  That’s not really criticism.  I just want that."


#### Feedback from Aaron C.

"Dan not only has a great personality but is a brilliant developer. We’ve paired together on various challenges over the course of my time at Turing, and he continues to amaze me with his insight and ability. The passion Dan has for writing well structured code and continually pushing his knowledge is contagious. I can’t wait to see where he goes in his career. Any development team would be lucky to have Dan as a member."




### Playing a Part

#### Pairing with Thom

Thom and I have been pairing almost every Tuesday morning since he started mod 1. The first time around was a little rough but he has grown so much since then. It's been great seeing him tackle more and more difficult problems and gaining the confidence he needs to excel.

#### Code Colorado & Meetups

I attended the Code Colorado event and an Ember meetup. I'd love to attend more but let's be honest, Turing takes a lot out of you and I'm hoping to not burn out before I start my career.
