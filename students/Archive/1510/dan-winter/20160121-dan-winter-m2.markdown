# Dan Winter - Module 2 Portfolio


## Individual


### Your Mission


I came to Turing to make a difference in my life and in my community.

Lately I've been thinking about the quote from Archimedes about the power of levers; "Give me a place to stand on and I will move the earth."

I've never seen anything quite like the power of the lever that software development has to impact huge volumes of people. Turing's ability to enable access to such a lever is unmatched and I aim to move the earth to benefit my community, even if that is helping just one person at a time.

#### Dan's reflection

Traffic Spy was a good starter project for working with a web application. I felt we could have pushed ourselves more but I have also received feedback that I can go too fast and that my enthusiasm for tackling new challenges can seem headstrong. I plan on working on my pacing and working better with my classmates on future projects so that we all get the most out of the experience.

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Brant from Traffic Spy

"Brant is great partner to have on a project because he is focused, knowledgeable and fun to be around. Brant’s determination to do well and learn pushes the rest of the team towards those same goals. At times, it seems like Brant doesn’t speak up because he isn’t 100% sure about something but the reality is, none of us are 100% sure about anything programming related. If he were to voice opinions a bit more and a bit more strongly, it would help his team better clarify their vision."

#### Feedback to Steve from Traffic Spy and Little Shop

"Working with Steve on two projects this module was a great experience. He’s always willing to do whatever the team needs and takes on challenges without needing to be asked. Steve is easy to work with as a pair by thinking critically about the challenge and gets things done quickly when working solo. Not only can he Rails, he can also CSS/Materialize very well. One of the things that I would to have loved was if we paired more on front end shenanigans so that I could learn more of his CSS-Fu ways."

#### Feedback to Beth from Little Shop

"What a project manager! Beth was on it from the beginning and ensured we maintained proper Github workflow, kept up on our waffles and didn’t let anything sneak through the cracks. She helped keep the team focused when dreams of a Stache filled world drew us off task. Beth’s programming skills and analytical mind were a huge asset to the team and she easily caught bugs that made it past our tests."

### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Brant for Traffic Spy

"Dan was a solid Project Manager on our Traffic Spy project. He has good vision of where the project is currently and where it ultimately needs to go. One suggestion for Dan is to be aware of how headstrong he is. He has strong opinions about how he things something can be implemented, and some people may interpret his enthusiasm for his ideas as a lack of flexibility. Dan often solves problems faster than others; being aware of this and helping others to the solution is a great way of continuing to build his already solid leadership skills."

#### Dan's Reflection

Thanks Brant, that’s definitely something I need to work on and I appreciate your candor. I’ll try to concentrate on that next module.

#### Feedback from Beth for Little Shop

"Dan is great to pair with because he is very enthusiastic about project ideas. He thinks of ideas outside the scope of the project and works hard to implement them. I am constantly impressed by the amount of time he puts into exploring things outside of class. Sometimes he got so excited about new ideas that he lost focus on the current feature we were working on, but he told me he was working on this, and as the project went on, he became much more focused."

#### Dan's Reflection

Particularly when I understand things well, I get bored easily and want to move on to more exciting things. I'm working on staying focused, even when things seem mundane. I want to keep on tackling new and interesting challenges but there's a time and a place for that. I need to focus more on working with my classmates to ensure they have the same understanding of concepts before moving on to larger challenges.

#### Feedback from Steve for Traffic Spy and Little Shop

"I was able to work with Dan on both of the big projects this module, and am glad that was the case. He’s among the most intellectually ambitious and curious of our class, and is always pushing to try things in new and interesting ways. His drive to really learn the concepts pushes the whole group to learn more, and he can quickly grasp how all the parts fit together in the big picture. He’s easy to work with, and is very open to suggestions, while being willing to defend his position when warranted."

#### Dan's Reflection

I appreciate Steve's words but after reflecting on feedback from Brant, I worry that I don't always come off as welcome to other approaches and that I move too quickly. Balance will be key moving forward.


### Playing a Part

#### Pairing with Thom

During the first week of the module I had the opportunity to have lunch with Thom. He expressed a lot of anxiety about repeating and I offered to pair with him every Tuesday morning. He immediately took me up on it and although he will be repeating module 1, he is starting to develop better trouble shooting and problem solving skills and has a much healthier attitude towards repeating and how he can take advantage of it rather than face it as a burden.

Feedback from Thom regarding our sessions:
"Dan Winter has been helping me on Tuesday mornings since my second week at Turing. Dan approached me about it while at lunch, so I didn’t even have to ask.
He’s found where I’ve been struggling and than walked me through it. Doing an amazing job of asking pointed questions to make me think, so I can arrive at the answer rather than giving it to me."

#### Spreading Life in the Dungeon

Sunny approached me with an idea early in the module to transform a portion of the basement into a plant haven. I loved the idea and helped execute operation Pinterest Flowerpot Post over the holiday break.

#### Rabbit Holes, Staches, and Module 2 at Turing


As a module 2 student at Turing School of Software and Design, we spend a lot of time in the dungeon, as it is affectionately known. Students have been known to sleep there on occasion, finishing one of the challenging projects that fill our classes. It wasn’t always about the stache. Module 1 was about logic, reasoning and laying a foundation in object oriented programming using Ruby to solve challenges like building cryptographic tools used in World War II or building data storage and performing analysis on almost one hundred thousand lines of school performance csv data.
Module 2 has been different, to say the least. We dove head first into Sinatra, a domain specific language built in Ruby used to create web applications. It’s like Rails but having to build a lot more from scratch. That’s been a theme here at Turing.

Teacher: “Go build that complicated thing”
Student: “That’s not really a thing that people can build, is it?”
Teacher: “Start with a test and fix the error.”

Fast forward several gruelling days or weeks of this conversation repeated over and over again.

Teacher: “Now that you can build that on your own, here are some easy tools to do it for you.”

And thus, we were given Rails. And staches. Okay, maybe that wasn’t the directive from Turing but the mission seemed clear to my team from the start. We were told to build an online store, complete with items for sale, carts, admin functionality to view order details and create new items to sell. I was an early proponent for Jurassic Farms - the first online dinosaur butchery. After lively and passionate debate, we settled on Private Stache, a luxury mustache boutique, and I’m the better for it.

We spent the first few days putting into practice the use of acronyms like CRUD and STACHE(not a real software acronym, as far as I know). As a junior web developer, there’s a ton to learn. There are plenty of acronyms, definitions, frameworks and various other impressive sounding technical terms I don’t know and I’m frequently wrong. I’m okay with that, as long as I learn from the process. Failure is one of the best ways to learn, it’s how you react that matters.

It can be hard not to fall into a rabbit hole working on final projects. There’s always a new language to learn, gem to use or fad to chase. There seems to be no end to additional features, more tests or better refactoring. It’s hard to tell what’s worth spending time on and when to go ask for help or maybe accept that my idea is too ridiculous or will take too long.

I’m here to tell you some rabbit holes are worth falling into, headfirst. But first get interested. In something. When you are curious and excited about what you’re doing, you learn more. Not just a little more, substantially more. For me, that rabbit hole was the stache cam. We had this crazy idea that we should let our fictional online customers try on our fine mustaches before purchasing them in an effort to drive fake sales.
God Driven Development was in full force when I signed up for an account with Face Plus Plus, an API that responds to photos with facial recognition and detection analysis. I dreamt of stache-ing the world, one Private Stache customer at a time.
Let’s just say my Face Plus Plus account hasn’t sent a single API request. It didn’t work out the way I wanted. I looked through several other APIs to no avail. I didn’t know how to do it. I struggled. I asked for help. I thought of a different solution and found a gem that helped me access our user’s webcams. Another problem hit with the webcam gem when the hooks I needed for my controllers didn’t work. I figured out a different way. I monkey patched my way around it so much that when I explained what I had done to one of my mentors, they listed out each step I took as if recalling cardinal sins of programming. And told me not to do it again.
But I wrote my first JavaScript function. And I learned about Ruby threads and modifying my own gems. I read through open source code when things didn’t work like I expected and even ended up hosting the app myself on my own digital ocean droplet. I failed and I learned and I adapted. After it all, the stache cam lives.
