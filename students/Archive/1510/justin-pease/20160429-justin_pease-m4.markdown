### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn as much javascript as I could.  The ability to learn js under Steve and Meeka is a very valuable thing so I wanted to soak up as much as I could.  I also wanted to come through a module successfully one time.  The first 2 modules here were incredibly difficult for me. Things started to pick up steam after that but I blew up my final project in mod 3 and repeated that too.  I feel that I could spend more time with the material in mod 4 to really nail it in place but I feel like the forward momentum did continue in this module and I feel that I navigated this module successfully which really was a big deal for me.

## Team Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

- Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

##### Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)
150 for all 3 checkins
190 for final implementation

##### Playability Features

All present and then some

##### Extensions

- MultiPlayer - 10
- Websockets - 20
- Canvas Expansion - 20

##### Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

##### User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### Testing

30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

##### JavaScript Style

25 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### The output from JSHint shows…

10 points - Five or fewer complaints

## Individual Projects

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jpease1020/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Every project that we've done so far—with the exception of Game Time—has been bound by the whole HTTP request/response cycle. In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

#### Instructor Feedback

148/200 points

##### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 75 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

##### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 20 points - Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components. Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many large methods or functions and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code does.

##### Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

##### Test-Driven Development

* 20 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.

##### Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Workflow

* 4 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for James Crockett -
Jamie was great to work with on the Game Time project.  It was incredible watching him and Jamie take off with their ability to absorb and use the advanced javascript methods we learned in class.   Jamie figured out web sockets and some the advanced methods such as partial application and bind very quickly.  I was definitely getting behind in the project but he was very patient helping to get me caught up with the complex things he implemented.  Honestly, game time was the best group project experience of Turing for me and it was because Jamie and JP were not only very talented programmers but they were just very easy to work with.  I know were supposed to give some negative feedback but I really can’t think of anything.  Working with those guys was just a great over all experience.

Feedback for JP -
JP was great to work in during the Game Time project.  It was incredible watching him and Jamie take off with their ability to absorb and use the advanced javascript methods we learned in class.  JP also took on an extension that was very challenging and knocked it out of the park.  I was definitely getting behind in the project but he was very patient helping to get me caught up with the complex things he implemented.  He was incredibly easy to work with.  I really can’t offer a lot of negative feedback because I didn’t see any.  On a personal level, he is a very kind person but I think he could do more to share himself with the people around him.  I need to take the exact same advice but he is a pretty cool guy and I think people would really benefit from his friendship.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from JP -
Having the opportunity to work with Justin on the GameTime project was a true pleasure. This was the first time we got to really spend a lot of time working on something together, and he showed himself to be an unrelentingly positive and constructive team member. Justin faced an additional challenge on this project as he joined our group ~3 days in when Jamie and I had already constructed part of the codebase. He managed to get caught up and still tackle new and interesting challenges with us (websockets in particular!). I almost feel as though Justin may have undervalued his contribution to the project since he had to learn the existing code at first, but I can safely say it would not have succeeded without his input. Justin also excels at working in a team environment, and does a great job of communicating and making sure the whole group is on the same page. He should definitely be proud of his ample contributions, and I’d love to have the opportunity to work with him again!

Feedback from Jamie -
One of Justin's best qualities is his eagerness to communicate and make sure everybody is on the same page. Our gametime project had many new/different concepts going on simultaneously, and it wasn't unusual to break for the day as a group but come back the next day to a brand new feature having been heavily worked on and advanced. Justin urged us to walk through these new features together so that we all understood the inner workings. That was super helpful for me as a teammate, because I have a tendency to rush on to the next unsolved issue too quickly. There were multiple instances where I eagerly jumped in to explain a feature, only to realize half way through that I didn't fully understand the process going on either. I felt we all understood a larger portion of the final product than we otherwise would have without Justin's guidance. Constructively, I think Justin sometimes tries to code like I used to play piano pieces, which was to memorize the whole thing at all times. It's super helpful to walk through and understand the innards of a class or object, but try to be comfortable forgetting it too. It's nigh impossible to maintain a full application's context and functionality in your head, so once you grasp a concept, trust your ability to reason through it again later, accept it for the high level responsibility it handles, and allow your mental storage to move forward.

### Playing a Part

I have spent a bit of time with Sonia from mod 1 helping her learn ruby.  I have also started a group last week for the kids repeating mod 1 and pairing with them one on one to help them get a better understanding of ruby and helping them prepare for repeating mod 1 successfully.  I plan on helping them next week during the intermission.
