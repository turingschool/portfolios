### Areas of Emphasis

(Before) - Being my second time through module 3 I have some new goals.  I have some technologies that I want to learn but there are some other personal learning challenges I want to address.  I had 2 learning challenges that I need to overcome.  

Technical goals are to learn jQuery, ajax, javascript and to increase my typing speed and ability.  I am interested to learn how these technologies can increase the web app I build with ruby and Rails.  I also want to deepen my understanding of rails and take the opportunity to fine tune the structure of my rails apps.  

The areas that have come to my attention in my learning style that I would like to address are: 1. When I don't understand something, I have tended to use code that works rather than getting a deep understanding of what is happening.  The best example is api calls.  I used code from our class and when the api I was working with didn't match that example, I couldn't adjust my code because I didn't fully understand what was happening.  2. I don't memorize information well until I have a tremendous amount of time working with it.  There are many pieces of code that I do understand but would not be able to remember how to rewrite it unless I have a section of code from another project in front of me.  I'm not actually sure what to do about this.  There is so much code that we use I will never be able to memorize it all and if I understand how it works I don't feel bad taking past code but I also don't fully feel comfortable not being able to remember a lot of things that we need to use.  

(After) - I am encouraged reading the above notes from the beginning of the module.  I feel that the goals that I set out to accomplish were successfully tackled.  I was able to learn more about rails, fill in the gaps of knowledge in api calls and the oauth process, and I was able to build a significant part of my final project with ajax and javascript.  

I was disappointed in my final project since I felt I was strong enough to produce a great app to display but the final product was lack luster.  I took on a challenge to use javascript and ajax which I was pretty pleased with but there were some issues that I didn't resolve in time.

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL] - https://github.com/Jpease1020/the_pivot
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md

In this project, we built upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. We transformed our restaurant ordering site into a platform that handles multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business had their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

* [Original Assignment] -https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we'll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.


#### Rales Engine

* [Original Assignment] - https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md

In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

Assessor: Lovisa

Notes:

all methods implemented expect "best day associated with one item"
extensive testing, could improved organization within the test to increase readability
Very restful API, well designed and well organized
only SQL for your queries :thumbsup:

### Giving Feedback
Feedback for Lenny Meyerson

I really enjoyed working with Lenny on the Pivot.  Lenny is very very funny.   A good personality is very important when working in close quarters.  Lenny is a very deep thinker and likes to understand things deeply which is a big asset for long term growth.  When I worked with him I saw an intelligent guy who was comfortable with the code.  Lenny may need to assess his own learning style.  He struggled with the module but I defiantly saw a very intelligent and capable guy so that leads me to believe there may be something in the process he uses to learn that may need to be adjusted.  Looking at the process may give insight on how to adjust and allow his abilities to shine.  During the pivot, Lenny had a system for looking at pull requests which was very thorough and challenged me to be more thorough but I did questions his ability to step outside that process and question it allowing him to make better decisions on when to be thorough and when he didn’t need to be.  Over all, I reaffirm that I very much enjoyed working with him during the project.


Feedback for Beth Sebian

Beth was great to work with.  
Beth was the team lead for our little shop project and she was a natural.  She was well organized and was very good at delegating task for the team.  It took me a while to adjust to her style but once I understood it I found a lot of value in it and was able to learn a lot from her system of organization.  I wonder if Beth would benefit form being a little more assertive when dealing with issues in the team.  I had a fe challenges getting some stuff done in the amount of time appropriate for the tasks I was working on and it felt to me that Beth was bothered well before she mentioned.  I may be wrong but if I assess this properly, she should feel comfortable addressing issues sooner.  She has a lot of leadership qualities and contributed much to the project code.
### Feedback Received

From - Steve Pentler
“I thought I had an extreme work ethic until I met Justin. But more importantly, exaggerations aside, I don’t think I would nearing the end of module 3 without Justin’s help. When I was in module one, he consistently met with me on Thursday mornings to review code or cover topics of my choice. During those sessions, a lot of ‘Ah hah!’ moments happened,  which likely made the difference considering I was on the cusp. Thank you!”

From - Beth Sebian
Justin was a pleasure to work with. Although he and I paired on one of my more challenging projects here at Turing, the project stood out for the low-stress culture our team created. Justin had a big influence on that culture, and I learned a lot being able to work with him. In particular, Justin is respectful and communicative with teammates, worked hard to get the work done, took ownership of tasks assigned to him (especially bringing issues back to me as project manager to make sure our project direction was clear), and checking in with teammates regularly to make sure we were all keeping sane. On this latter point in particular, Justin stood out to me as a leader. Our project did struggle with pace a bit on that project; where Justin struggled with that in particular, I would have liked to see him be more proactive to work with deadlines and communicate with me if they were not realistic — it took our team awhile to find a good rhythm on that front. In general, Justin was a treat to work with. He lent calmness and an easy-going vibe to the project, and you put in a lot of effort to get the job done.


From - Lenny Meyerson
Working with Justin on the only group project we had during Module 3 was great for me. Justin has a keen desire to be supportive. He wants to help. Any question I might have had or discomfort that I voiced was always met with a drop-everything-this-is-important attitude. He was enormously enthusiastic about every aspect of the project. His attitude made me want to work harder, it made long hours more tolerable, and it made questions easier to ask. He shared opinions based on previous experience but was always open to trying new ways.  
The only real critic of Justin that had after our two week adventure was that his enthusiasm sometimes blinded him to the level of workload to be handled. It became clear pretty quickly on our project that Justin’s genuine enjoyment of the coding experience sometimes rendered his time estimates of given task less than reliable. Setting out on a given task, full of confidence and enthusiasm, Justin might pronounce that said task should take no more that half an hour. Three hours later and nearly done with that task his enthusiasm seemed undaunted by the clock. It’s hard to find real fault in this. Time and experience will likely improve on Justin’s ability to estimate a given task’s time demands. It is, however, worth noting and maybe something he wants to keep in mind as he prepares to head, gleefully, into the work force.

### Playing a Part

This module I played a part by offering 2 student led sessions on the object model for mod 1 students to help them get the concepts down.  I also had weekly pairing sessions with Emily McClung and Emily Blanchard until they both left school for personal reasons.  I also did a few things around Turing which needed to be done like cleaning the fridge and mopping up the water spill which resulted in our posse receiving a generous amount of points so I feel like I had a big hand in getting some t-shirts (unashamed assuming our win at the time of this writing) to my posse teammates which obviously is the biggest accomplishment at the entire school of Turing.
