# James Crockett -- Module 2 Portfolio
​​
### Mission

My mission coming to Turing is to pivot. After exhausting myself​ working in customer service for a tech company, I found a passion for programming during part-time HTML/CSS classes and decided I wanted to shift course. Long-term, my mission is to find a company much like the one I came from, with a position that let's me solve problems and work on cool projects every day. I want to be in a position that allows me to work and pair with like-minded, growth mindset people and continue to evolve as a developer and a professional.

### Traffic Spy
Assessed by: Rachel
Partners: Lenny and Greg

Traffic spy involved tracking the web-traffic for a given website in a database and building a web interface to display that data, like a miniature Google Analytics. I remember being nervous to run migrations at the onset, and by the end we were fearlessly experimenting with ActiveRecord methods to avoid as much unnecessary Ruby as possible. It was a great introduction to databases and the relationships you can create through them.

* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

##### Notes:

* 104 assertions 47 test,
* 96.5 coverage
* Used a few partials.
* Some opportunities to refactor ruby into separate methods.
* I liked how you used methods to abstract out conditionals.
* Think aobut how you would refactor to make use of Poros and helper methods in your view.

##### Scores:

* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Encapsulation: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra/Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3


### Little Shop

​Assessor: Rachel

Little shop involved following client-provided user stories to build a "little shop" capable of taking and recording orders. It was my favorite Turing project to date, as it allowed our creativity to flow a bit and experiment in addition to reinforcing all of the rails CRUD functionality.

## Community

### Giving Feedback
To Brant: Brant has been one of my favorite partners to work with. He really enjoys the TDD process and that fosters a positive pairing experience. He takes pride in practicing doing things the right way, and that has helped me learn proper techniques for merging branches and resolving merge conflicts. My biggest suggestion for Brant is to realize some of his old weaknesses might now be strengths. In our "DTR" talks he would often prewarn the group of some bad habits, only to find he was the best in the group at holding everyone accountable for those. I believe he is more capable of taking on more of a leadership role than he gives himself credit for.

To Penny: Pairing with Penny on Little Shop taught me that she has a genuine curiosity and desire to learn every aspect of a project. She's even interested in learning about the odd errors her partners run into on their own and how those were resolved. I also like that she's eager to bite into and take ownership of large aspects of a project, as she did with authentication and a lot of the admin functionality in Little Shop.  My biggest suggestion for Penny would be to force herself to take breaks if she's stuck on an issue. I get the same tunnel vision, but it's important to not let the road blocks consume you.

### Being a Community Member
"Jamie has been great to work with for the last two weeks - (Rails Mini-Project and Little Shop). He enjoys solving problems and this enthusiasm spills over to the rest of the team. When Jamie arrives at a solution before others, he makes sure that everyone gets caught up before moving on to the next issue. Jamie and I have talked about how we are both VERY flexible when working with a team. This is a great trait to have, and I understand where he is coming from (because I approach projects from a similar perspective), but I encourage Jamie to bring it up during future DTRs with other teams so that everyone is aware of it, and that its not interpreted as a lack of desire to work on the project." - Brant Wellman

“My experience working with Jamie (and Lenny!) on TrafficSpy was one of my favorite experiences working in a group so far at Turing. We all paired continuously throughout the project, which was quite helpful to me to be able to draw upon both of their knowledge bases while learning Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Jamie is great at tracking down the root causes of error traces, and I learned a lot about general refactoring while working with him. TrafficSpy was, in my opinion, one of my best projects in terms of how well we refactored our code to push logic down the stack, and I owe a lot of that to working with Jamie. We fed off of each other’s ideas due to the friendly interactions while working, and we were able to complete the project in a comfortable timeframe due to his willingness to put in ample time for working." - Greg Armstrong

"I have seriously enjoyed working with Jamie on Little Shop. His ability to think through tough logic and algorithms is really impressive and inspiring - I hope I can one day navigate a web app as well as he does! I have learned a ton and felt really supported along the way. Jamie is patient, kind, and always willing to explain anything his team doesn’t understand. I hope we can work together in the future and I know he has great things on the horizon." - Penny Garrett

"Working with Jamie on Traffic Spy was an excellent experience. He was keen, insightful, and eager to work. I greatly appreciated his patience in explaining aspects of Sinatra or our code as the project increased in size and complexity. Perhaps most of all I was struck by how much Jamie seemed to genuinely enjoy the project process. Nothing seemed to cause significant stress to him and his easy enjoyment was contagious.  Traffic Spy was the lowest stress experience on a Turing project I had yet had and that is owed in large part to working with Jamie. I look forward to working with him again." - Lenny Meyerson

### Playing a Part
​
I participate in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:
* Brew coffee like it's my job
* Posse lunch!
* Did dishes week 1 and week 6, the first time not having used any dishes/cups that day
* Attended/volunteered at two Kids Who Code classes
* Paired with Deb in 1511 to help with Headcount
* Regularly available to eat leftover pizza


### Attendance
Out sick 1 day week three and 1.5 days week four (after the break). To ensure I didn't fall behind on the material, I made sure to be involved in the parts of the group projects that implemented the content I missed. The second instance, when I missed 1.5 days, I set up a pairing session with Rachel to clear up the couple gray areas I didn't understand when studying the material on my own.
