# James Crockett - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to significantly advance my JavaScript, specifically learning and practicing object-oriented design. Most of my JS prior to this module was of the "throw it all in the machine and have it spit back my value" variety. I became much more organized with it this module and, ultimately, have reached the point where I'd like to make sure JS is involved in my future job so I can continue working with it. I also hadn't planned to contribute to open-source at the onset, but I am proud that Shannon and I were able to both contribute in a meaningful way to a package and create one of our own. It significantly raised my confidence when it comes to joining the developer community post-Turing.

### Work

#### RealTime

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

RealTime involved utilizing websockets to create a polling application (in my case) that updates for admins and voters in real time. It was nice for me because I had already played with websockets during Gametime, so I felt I picked things up rather quickly. I am particularly proud of the elegant user interface I created for this application.

Our game, Faux-Gar, is modeled after the Agar.io game. It was by far my favorite project of the module and the product of which I'm most proud from my time at Turing. We were able to create an online, multi-player game incorporating websockets. We also incorporated tough features from the original game, such as canvas scaling, while also adding some extra features of our own like speed boosts.

##### Instructor Feedback

Our cross-platform application easily resizes images to your desired width or length. We implemented drag and drop functionality and allow users to drag or open as many images files at once as they want. The coolest part about this project for me was that we were able to contribute to an open source project adding significant functionality to another electron image resizing package, as well as create a package of our own that has been downloaded 144 times to date.

##### Open Source Contributions
- Package to which we contributed: https://github.com/jecrockett/electron-image-resize
- Package we published: https://github.com/jecrockett/dimension_calculator

##### Instructor Feedback
- Specifically liked that we took on HTML5 drag and drop

##### Scores
- Blog Post: 60 points
- Participation: 30 points
- Risk Taking and Creativity: 60 points
- Extension for open-source: 20 points

### Giving Feedback

##### To Justin:
One of Justin's best qualities is his eagerness to communicate and make sure everybody is on the same page. Our gametime project had many new/different concepts going on simultaneously, and it wasn't unusual to break for the day as a group but come back the next day to a brand new feature having been heavily worked on and advanced. Justin urged us to walk through these new features together so that we all understood the inner workings. That was super helpful for me as a teammate, because I have a tendency to rush on to the next unsolved issue too quickly. There were multiple instances where I eagerly jumped in to explain a feature, only to realize half way through that I didn't fully understand the process going on either. I felt we all understood a larger portion of the final product than we otherwise would have without Justin's guidance. Constructively, I think Justin sometimes tries to code like I used to play piano pieces, which was to memorize the whole thing at all times. It's super helpful to walk through and understand the innards of a class or object, but try to be comfortable forgetting it too. It's nigh impossible to maintain a full application's context and functionality in your head, so once you grasp a concept, trust your ability to reason through it again later, accept it for the high level responsibility it handles, and allow your mental storage to move forward.

##### To JP:
I end up saying this about someone different every module, but JP was probably my favorite person to work with at Turing. His drive to figure out complex problems and implement cool features is motivating, and his insistence that we could and would figure out how to implement certain features lead to the project I'm most proud of from my whole Turing experience. For someone that can sometimes hop on the express train and pump out features and fixes overnight, JP is also one of the easiest people to work with in a group. He's sharp yet humble, focused yet good-humored, and relaxed yet organized (I've never seen anybody waffle like JP waffles). Constructively, I don't have much for JP. Occasionally it would be challenging to come back together as a group and find he had gone pretty far ahead into a certain feature, but he was great at explaining his code and without those instances we wouldn't have accomplished as much as we did, so I feel those situations benefited us more than anything else. I'd just encourage JP to keep up the optimism and keep pushing beyond the limits others aren't sure they can surpass.

##### To Shannon:
Shannon is my kind of partner. She's super laid back, doesn't get overly stressed about things working or not working, and just plugs away and writes awesome features. She spearheaded our push into HTML5 drag-and-drop, paying no heed to the ominous warnings from our instructors. She cracks jokes and remains patient and positive while working through complex issues, rarely showing signs of frustration. Constructively, there were a couple days where XYZ came up and we ended up not being able to pair and get as much done as we might have hoped. Shannon (and me, by the way) could be more mindful when it comes to communicating those scheduling issues and setting expectations for what would or would not get done. Personally her style is a great fit for me and didn't phase me one bit, I like to go with the flow, but I can think of other partners I've had who might have been stressed out by the work flow during the first couple days of our electron project.

### Being a Community Member

##### From Justin:
Jamie was great to work with on the Game Time project.  It was incredible watching him and Jamie take off with their ability to absorb and use the advanced javascript methods we learned in class.   Jamie figured out web sockets and some the advanced methods such as partial application and bind very quickly.  I was definitely getting behind in the project but he was very patient helping to get me caught up with the complex things he implemented.  Honestly, game time was the best group project experience of Turing for me and it was because Jamie and JP were not only very talented programmers but they were just very easy to work with.  I know were supposed to give some negative feedback but I really can’t think of anything.  Working with those guys was just a great over all experience.

##### From JP:
GameTime was, for me, by far the best project I worked on at Turing, and I can safely say that it would not have been a success without Jamie. Every pairing experience I’ve had at Turing has been positive, but I really feel that we had an exceptional rapport and synergy on this project. We tackled a lot of difficult challenges and extensions, and Jamie brought a lot of energy to the team. He very quickly grasped and drove the implementation of our websockets, and was heavily involved in every aspect of the production app. Jamie’s enthusiasm really inspired me as well, and thanks to his input, we achieved many things that we expected to have to “wishlist” before the midway point of the project. He also has a particular gift for refactoring, and helped me clean up a lot of the code for our most important features. I have no doubt that Jamie is going to be a great success wherever he winds up after Turing, not only because he is a strong coder, but because he is a great person and team member. I can’t wait to see what he manages to achieve in the coming months.

##### From Shannon:
Working with Jamie on Scale up was awesome. I went into the project understanding almost nothing about what we were doing. Jamie was patient enough to catch me up and talk me through his process, so that I was able to start contributing as well. I’ve definitely had other partners who would have just moved on without me, so I really appreciate Jamie’s ability to make sure we were both on the same page. His enthusiasm to push to open source infected me, and by the end of the project we were both jumping up and down over getting our packages on NMP. I have to credit Jamie with pushing us to take it that far, which turned into something amazing.
sorry about the grammar

### Playing a Part
- Group pairing with Module 1 during JungleBeats
- Brought in banana bread two different times for whoever wanted it
- Regularly made coffee and publicly scorned folks who hear the gurgle and run.
