### Your Mission

My mission coming to Turing is to pivot. After exhausting myself​ working in customer service for a tech company, I found a passion for programming during part-time HTML/CSS classes and decided I wanted to shift course. Long-term, my mission is to find a company much like the one I came from, with a position that let's me solve problems and work on cool projects every day. Short-term, I want to further immerse myself in the Turing community now that I feel more comfortable here. I'll never have another opportunity to spend so much time simply practicing and getting good at something, and I need to do a better job maximizing this experience.

#### JungleBeat

Assessor: Mike

The JungleBeat project explored the concept of the linked list data structure. It involved stringing several 'beats' together and manipulating the list to delete, inject, search, etc. the data structure.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)


##### Notes:

* 46 Assertions
* Some repetition of code that can be pulled out
* Some minor opportunities for refactoring to make code better for general use

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


#### Enigma

​Assessor: Mike

Enigma was my favorite project this module. The primary goal was to get more comfortable breaking up a program into logical components. It involved creating a program that would encrypt a string using the enigma encryption method used by the Germans in WW2. The program can encrypt the string and provide a decryption key, decrypt the string with the key, and can even "crack" the key if the encrypted message ends with "..end..".

### Projects

#### HTTP, Yeah You Know Me
Pair: Taylor Moore
Assessor: Mike
​
This project involved building a basic web server that can receive user requests and respond accordingly. It allows users to track the number of requests made, check if submitted word are real words, and play a guessing game to guess a number 1-10.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

##### Notes:
* 25 tests
* Tests should be structured so that they don’t require interactivity with postman/whatever
* Some opportunities to refactor down longer methods, and clear up unnecessary variable assignment

##### Scores:
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3


#### Headcount
Pair: Beth Secor
Assessor: Andrew
​
This project involved parsing/extracting data from many CSV files related to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. We extracted and formatted that data into a searchable structure, organized it by the type of data it represented (enrollments, statewide test results, and economic profiles) and analyzed the differences in those numbers across nearly 200 school districts.

### Giving Feedback

​Beth Secor:

“Two of Beth's greatest gifts are her willingness to adapt to her partner, and her patience, both with her partner and the code itself.

Early on I told Beth that I was a visual learner, and she knew I spent the first night drawing diagrams to help wrap my brain around the project.  A couple days later, after a 5AM inspiration caused Beth to create a new class in our project, she was prepared later that morning with a pad and pen to literally illustrate her creation for me.

Beth's also a brilliant debugger. She can look at an obscure error message, mentally trace the chain of method calls, and identify the most probable issue. Even during long debugging processes, Beth is rarely flustered and methodically proceeds head on.

Beth has a true affinity for the Master branch. She is admirably devoted to it, and loves to work from it. My suggestion to her would be to...branch out a little more. It's OK to mess around with other branches on the side. Nothing long-term, it can be "Netflix and chill" temporary kind of flings. Seriously--it's encouraged. Otherwise one of these days Beth and the Master branch are going to get in a huge ruthless fight, as all couples do, and let's just hope when that day comes the Master branch forgives her.

Taylor Moore:

Taylor is super collaborative and comes up with creative solutions to problems, in part because he's very comfortable with less-frequently used enumerables such as 'reduce.' He always strives to create something in the most efficient way possible (which is a good instinct, but sometimes his infatuation with the best possible way distracts him from the bigger picture). He has a calming demeanor that I found easy to work with and communicates expectations well.”

Marlo Major:

Marlo is in the Weirich posse with me and he was the first person at Turing to really make me feel at home. He has a calming and mature presence that many in the community, including myself, are drawn to. I remember being stuck on my first project and working through a debugging process with him one morning. We didn't solve the problem, but that highlighted one of my favorite things about Marlo. Multiple times he checked in on me later that day, both on Slack and in person, to see if the problem had been solved. When it finally had been, instead of just saying "Great!" he was curious -- "What was the issue? How did you fix it?" He showed a genuine interest in me and my project that I didn't expect him to have. I hope I'm able to make the future cohorts/students feel as welcomed and belonging as Marlo has done for me. He's definitely a strong asset to the community.

### Being a Community Member
​
"I love working with Jamie! He is hilarious and makes programming fun. He is excellent at keeping the momentum going on a project. Despite his belief that I am faster at programming than him (which is simply not true), he is ​**wicked**​ smart (read with a Boston accent) and provides interesting solutions to complex problems. For example, he saw an opportunity to implement a method recursively that I would have never thought of. My only suggestion for him to improve his obvious success at Turing would be to not stress out if other people are ahead of him on a project." - Beth Secor

Now that I’m in module two, I almost have a nostalgic feeling looking at module one students go through the same struggles I did. Throughout watching these struggles from afar, rarely would I find someone as passionate or as willing to go the extra mile to understand something, than Jamie. Jamie is in Weirich posse with me and he would consistently have his mind deep into the warm up, giving it his best, or trying to understand some concept from the days before, or working to further improve his skills as a developer. Honestly? It’s inspiring watching him work through problems, projects and assignments. Everyone goes through a similar struggle during module one, but Jamie handles it in a way that I hope to take with me to module 3; Jamie handles stress and the Turing workload with elegance. I’m lucky to have him in my posse and to have had some of the conversations we’ve had. Undoubtedly, he will be a phenomenal developer someday. - Marlo Major


"Working with Jamie has been an incredibly helpful and calming experience. During our Enigma project he spent a significant amount of time working through major sections of my code. I was most impressed by his ability to look at the intricacies of someone else's work and offer thoughtful suggestions that improved both functionality and design. He is always genuinely concerned with the progress and well being of others in the cohort and I hope to have the opportunity to collaborate with him in the future." - Brenna Martenson

### Playing a Part
​
I participate in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:
* Rectifying the weak coffee pandemic one pot at a time (brews a lot of coffee)
* Working on warm-ups and debugging code with my posse
* Collaborating and sharing ideas (and misery, sometimes) with classmates
* Going climbing with community members
* Hanging up unplugged HDMI cords left on the ground  (11/17)

Interested in:
* Kids Who Code
* Getting a small group together to explore a new language (Go, Phoenix, etc.)


### Attendance
No absences. Twice I arrived a couple minutes late.
