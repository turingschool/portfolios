# Brenna Martenson: Module 4
____
## Individual

### Your Mission

  Before I found Turing I had a plan to get really good at JavaScript at a 3 month bootcamp. Oddly enough, After 7 months at a far superior school, I feel like I have barely scratched the service about everything that is possible in that and other dev languages. The difference is that now this isn't just a pipe dream, it's a fully attainable goal and module 4 has allowed me to build a solid foundation on what work as developer could look like. I'm stoked!

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)

##### Project Description  
In this project, we'll be designing an interpretation of a traditional desktop application using Electron and React.

##### Learning Goals:  
  - An introduction to what both Ember and Electron are and how they work at a high level
  - Get a better understanding of how JavaScript and React can interact in a real world application
  - Troubleshoot without much documentation

##### Scores  
150/150


### Game Time AKA Jezzball
**Team:** Brenna Martenson & Steve Olson
**Assessed By:** Meeka Gayhart

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

##### Project Description  
Build a game that is playable in a browser built entirely with JavaScript.

##### Learning Goals:  
  - Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code
  - Separate business-logic code from view-related code
  - Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

### Feedback  

>**Steve Pentler** "It's extremely unfortunate that Steve and I never got work on an official project together at Turing. Instead we had to resort to throwing paper footballs at each other across the room and occasionally offering technical help with learning how to github. That's not true...we never played paper football. In all seriousness, I would not have made it through Turing with the same positive attitude and zeal for being in a basement if it weren't for Steve. Beyond his sense of humor, I award Steve "Most Improved" of our cohort. Far from a bullshit ribbon on a soccer team, I mean this in the most sincere way possible. He has grown into a rockstar programmer and any company that snags him will be incredibly lucky. Badgers4Lyfe."  

>**J.W.Perry** "JP and I got to spend an unforgettable week together learning about React and Electron. This was easily my favorite project of this module and working with JP was a significant part of that. I knew from the get go that our work flow together would be smooth and productive. He is incredibly reliable and is always ready to calmly unravel me from whatever chaos I've recently dug myself into. He is always quick to solve complex problems that would take me exceptionally longer to reason my way out of. I have complete faith in his technical abilities to overcome any technical challenge that is thrown his way, and am genuinely jealous of whatever team is lucky enough to pay him the exorbitant amount of money that he deserves."  

>**Steve Olson**  

>**Brant Wellman** "Brant has been the glue of 1510 since day 1. It may have started in a subtle way, but throughout our time at Turing I haven't met a single person who hasn't been significantly supported by him. He never hesitates to drop what he is doing to make sure others are ok, and I honestly can't count the number of times he has talked me down off the cliff of anxiety. Aside from emotional support, Brant has become a skilled and knowledgable programmer. From Module 1 to now I am incredibly impressed and proud of how far he has come in his abilities and I can't wait to see where he ends up."

> Brenna  cares! She is more approachable and generous with her time than anyone in 1510. At times, I’ve borderline abused her as a sounding board and she continues to respond to my sorry cries for help. And when she helps, her ability to articulate her thought process always impresses me. She is the force that keeps 1510 in balance, but don’t tell her that because she’s too humble to accept compliments. In terms of front-end design, she has almost single-handedly kept 1510’s views afloat. When people have a simple styling question, they consult me. When they have a complex styling question, they know who to talk to. I’m extremely happy that she is sticking around Turing. I have no doubt that she is going to nail the TA position and keep our cohort close and involved.  In terms of constructive feedback, I’m angry about two things. The first is that she is legendary at keeping friends out drinking past their bedtime, which is bad for my health. The second is that she’s so damn old, only because we couldn’t experience the Russell Wilson year at Wisconsin together. Roll Badge. **Steve Pentler**  

>I had the pleasure of working with Brenna on the ScaleUp project and couldn’t have asked for a better partner. Brenna is incredibly easy to work with, and is perpetually friendly, positive, and helpful. Brenna is also amazing with styling and CSS, but I sometimes feel as though she has more confidence in her prowess on front-end work than in her formidable back-end skills. She showed an exceptional ability to adapt to new tools and technologies as she very quickly grasped React and Electron, as well as how to properly structure our project to take advantage of them. I definitely learned a lot working with her, and have no doubt that she will be extremely successful wherever she lands after Turing! **J.W.Perry**  

> “Turing made the right decision when they decided to hire Brenna as a TA. When she is helping another student, not only does she truly care about helping that person understand what it is they are talking about, but also that she understands the concepts they are talking about. A number of times I've been that person being helped by Brenna, and I've experienced her empathy for others, and this is going to help her excel at teaching others at Turing. On the personal side, Brenna has been an unfailing source of support for me as I've gone through emotional hardships over the last 5 months. I can say without hesitation that I would not have gotten through Turing without her." **Brant Wellman**
