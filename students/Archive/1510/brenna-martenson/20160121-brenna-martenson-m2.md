# Brenna Martenson: Module 2
____
## Individual

### Mission

Coming into Module 2 I felt more prepared for the time and energy required to be successful at Turing. Diving into frameworks like Sinatra, Rails, and JQuery has allowed me to more fully appreciate the Ruby I learned in Module 1. It is extremely satisfying to work through how the pieces of programming come together, and my time in this module has further emphasized how excited I am to continue in this field.

##### Evaluation Comments:

  * 104 assertions, 47 tests
  * 96.5 coverage
  * Used a few partials.
  * Some opportunities to refactor ruby into separate methods.
  * I liked how you used methods to abstract out conditionals.
  * Think about how you would refactor to make use of Poros and helper methods in your view.

##### Scores:

3: Overall  - Application fulfills base expectations  

4: Test-Driven Development - Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data  

4: Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility  

3: Fundamental Ruby & Style - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

4: Sinatra / Web and Business Logic - Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

3: View Layer - Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

### Giving Feedback
>**Steve Oscaro** "I was lucky enough to work with Steve on a mini Rails project that focused on fleshing out full CRUD functionality mixed with a logical front end user interface and various additions. One of the best parts about working with Steve is his ability to exude confidence and control even when facing the inevitable road blocks. He has an amazing sense of humor that made these challenges oddly enjoyable, and I found that we worked at a very similar pace which made overcoming challenges a great learning experience for us both. My only criticism of Steve is his tendency towards teal when using the Materialize framework…I hope to one day work with him again and introduce him to other colors."

>**J.W.Perry**"I had the pleasure of working with J.P. on a project based in Sinatra called TrafficSpy. He has an amazing ability to patiently hone in on a problem and tease it apart until it makes sense, or until he knows the right question to ask. This makes his questions and comments meaningful and hold significant weight. I see so much skill and forethought in J.P.'s coding and problem solving abilities, my only criticism is that he may not see that in himself - I have no doubt that once he finds that confidence he will be a coding powerhouse!"

>**Taylor Moore** "I had the opportunity to work with Taylor on our final project for Module 2 called Little Shop of Orders. Taylor has a fantastic ability to commit to a task and put in the time and effort to get the job done. He is always enthusiastic to learn from his mistakes and take on new challenges. Although it is clear he has a knack for programming, consistent communication when working remotely is an area for improvement. It was challenging at times to know where Taylor was at with certain tasks, which made collaboration difficult.  In person, I felt that he and I had an excellent workflow. We could bounce ideas back and forth and find an effective solution to the problem at hand. I would be happy to work with him on future projects!"

>**Toni Rib** "Working with Toni has been such a positive experience on every level. She has an amazing ability to quickly focus a problem and find an effective solution, which is incredibly beneficial in large projects. Occasionally her impressive forethought can be hard to slow down, making offering other suggestions challenging at times. She is eager to take on difficult tasks and is always ready to offer opinions on project direction and design. I’ve found that our workflow together is extremely fluid and I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to work with her again!"

>**Jordan Lawler** "Jordan was part of my team for our Traffic Spy project working with Sinatra. He is exceptionally fun to work with, and has an incredible ability to see things way before they become an issue. I was extremely impressed with Jordan’s logic and algorithmic skills, he was the first to offer refactoring ideas and was always ready to patiently explain technical decisions that were beyond my grasp. It is clear Jordan’s brain works at warp speed, which is highly entertaining, but can sometimes lead to overlooking smaller details in syntax or orthography. It might be helpful as he moves forward to work on slowing down to avoid small errors. His wit and sense of humor are contagious even during the most stressful of times. I have never laughed as hard as when I was working with Jordan on TrafficSpy, which is an aspect of difficult projects that is hard to come by. I look forward to working with him in the future!"

### Being a Community Member

>“Working with Brenna on the rails mini-project over a weekend was a great experience. Our skill sets were complementary, so between the two of us, we were able to smoothly work through all of the challenges. Through her work, I was able to see how vanity URLs using slugs can be implemented in Rails, and gained a better understanding of some CSS concepts (because she is a front-end wizard)." **Steve Oscaro**  

>"Brenna is a great partner to work with. She is always engaged when the group is working together. She takes on tasks without having to be asked or assigned to them and communicates well to the group what she has completed and what she needs help with. She follows through on her commitments and never complains about taking on more work. She's also AMAZING when it comes to front end coding and styling websites quickly. I would be happy to work with Brenna again on any project!" **Toni Rib**

>"Having had the opportunity to work with Brenna on this module's Sinatra-based project, TrafficSpy, I can safely say that there isn't much more I could ask for in a collaborator. Reliable and eager to engage, Brenna is positive and helpful even in the most stressful situations. I found that she excels at communication and debugging, and is still my go-to person for help with HTML and CSS. If hard-pressed for actionable feedback, I would only suggest that I would love to see Brenna assert leadership more when group coding - advice that I should heed as well. I can only hope I have the chance to work with her again!" **J.W.Perry**

>"I had the pleasure to work with Brenna during the Traffic Spy project. She is quick, resourceful, and works great in a team dynamic, I would be ecstatic to have her as a teammate again. It is no secret that Brenna is a front end wizard, but the best part about working with her was that she allowed for others to take charge on the views, as well as patiently (very patiently!) helped others through their own view problems. When Brenna gets stuck on something (not often I might add), she is quick to get help while offering a detailed explanation of her thought process up to that point. This results in a quick discovery of the problem, and smooths out team workflow considerably. Things like this, details in communication, are a fresh of breath air, and something a lot of us at Turing could learn from!

>My piece of critique for Brenna would be to be more selfish during projects. She is incredibly generous with her time allocation, and may not always insist on working on the areas she would like. While this is obviously a great thing and should certainly not disappear, she could push more for her needs." **Jordan Lawler**

>"Working with Brenna on Little Shop was a treat. She is incredible with logic problems and is a level 10 wizard in CSS. I appreciate her because she spent time teaching me cool CSS tricks. Brenna has great ideas and is constantly challenging the group. Her positive attitude shines even when she's struggling. She quickly adapts to new ideas and can make any page look good in minutes! I would like to see Brenna be more assertive with her ideas. Otherwise, she was very supportive to me when I was in need, which makes her a great group member and a better friend. It was my pleasure to be on Brenna’s Team Awesome." **Taylor Moore**

## Playing a Part

During my last portfolio assessment one of the take aways was to find ways to be more involved in the community. I have always had trouble investing time in extra curricular activities that are academically related. I thoroughly enjoy what I am studying, but I find that I feel more well rounded when the energy I have leftover is directed to social outlets or athletic events.

With that being said, I have made an effort to spend more of my extra time at Turing to be available and part of the community. I've been lucky to have previous experience with front end development and have been happy to troubleshoot HTML and CSS issues with other students.

I am also part of the Student Advisory Board for 1510, which has meant leading group retro and being more aware of the emotional state of the cohort in general.
