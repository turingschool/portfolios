# Brenna Martenson: Module 1
___
## Individual

### Your Mission

Programming is about more than writing code. It's about joining a community of people that seek positive change through creativity and intelligent design. My goal is to establish a strong foundation of skills that cover all aspects of this field. Module 1 has been demonstrative proof that what I am looking to achieve is not only possible, but the best decision I could have made to set myself up for success as a software developer.

### Projects

The following projects are included as an evaluation of my technical progress through Module 1:
- HTTP Yeah You Know Me
- Enigma
- Jungle Beats
- Sorting Suite

#### Headcount

[GitHub URL]()  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/headcount)

##### Project Description:
Build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation.

Learning Goals:
Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software

##### Evaluation Comments:
- Finished late last night, know where we want to refactor but didn't want to break things
- Passes all of the spec harness
- 154 tests all pass -- FAST
- Tests look good, make time for edge cases (you already did the hard work)
- Excellent use of small data files for tests
- Implementation looks strong
- Only use @instance variables when setting, not getting
- Very good project

##### Scores:

- Functional Expectations: 3
- Test-Driven Development: 4
- Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
- Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring : 3
- Enumerable & Collections: 4
- Code Sanitation: 4



#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/martensonbj/http_yeah_you_know_me)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

##### Project Description:
Introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

**Learning Goals:**
- Practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components
- Practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels
- Understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works
- Practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses

##### Notes:
- 44 tests
- Iteration 1-3 complete, 4 does not completely work
- Some longer methods with opportunities to refactor for clarity and simplicity, specifically in methods with long complex conditionals, and try to avoid writing methods that modify an instance variable, as opposed to accepting a parameter and returning a value

##### Scores:

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Dan Winter** "Pairing with Dan on Headcount has been an amazingly positive experience, which is contrary to what I was told to expect from the workload. He has a contagious energy and enthusiasm that has been a constant source of strength throughout the project. Dan's impressive technical skills are evident in both his syntactical abilities and his understanding of the object model as a whole. Dan's ability to quickly find solutions results in quick action, which can be challenging as a pairing partner to feel included in the decision process. That being said, I feel completely comfortable communicating any confusions I have, and working through them together has lead to cleaner more understandable code."

>**Jamie Crockett** "Working with Jamie has been an incredibly helpful and calming experience. During our Enigma project he spent a significant amount of time working through major sections of my code. I was most impressed by his ability to look at the intricacies of someone else's work and offer thoughtful suggestions that improved both functionality and design. He is always genuinely concerned with the progress and well being of others in the cohort and I hope to have the opportunity to collaborate with him in the future."

>**Greg Armstrong** "Greg and I paired together on HTTP Yeah You Know Me, which was a challenging project conceptually. There were aspects of the project that we both would have liked to do differently, but his positive attitude and sense of humor allowed us to focus on our accomplishments. Despite all frustrations, Greg was enthusiastic and motivated which allowed us to stay positive and productive throughout the assignment. He was tireless in solving problems and made an effort to verbally walk through our plan of attack before diving into the code. Great pairing experience!"



>**Toni Rib** "Toni has been a source of inspiration to me throughout Module 1. We haven't had any official projects together, but the opportunities I have had to code with her have been very fluid and productive. Her ability to conceptually work through problems is a strong skill, and is immediately evident in the structure of her code. She is never afraid to speak her mind or challenge others to see things differently, which allows us all to feel more comfortable doing the same. Toni is consistently one of the first people to offer her time to help others and I look forward to working with her more in the future."

### Being a Community Member



> "You've been great to work with because no matter how complex the problem, you remained calm, even when frustrated. You are very hard on yourself and have high expectations but don't give yourself credit for how much you contribute and know. Your enthusiasm to learn how everything works and to follow the TDD process really drove our project and I will always be thankful to have had you as my partner on this project."
**Dan Winter**

>"Brenna has very good attention to detail and is great at explaining her ideas. She makes a great team member and pair because she rarely gets frustrated and is always willing to listen, try out new ideas, and help others. I think if she spoke up more often, she would realize that she knows even more than she thinks she does about problem solving and programming." **Toni Rib**


> “Working with Brenna on HTTP_yeah_you_know_me was a great pairing experience. We were not able to get as far into the project as we would’ve liked, however Brenna stuck with it and kept trying to complete it despite the difficulty of the project. She’s able to think about multiple solutions to a problem if one isn’t quite working out, and communicates effectively when pairing on a project." **Greg Armstrong**  



### Playing a Part

One of the best things about Turing is how quickly I have felt welcome and included. I have been less involved than I would like to admit in initiating community events, however I make an effort to join in organized events when possible.

I have enjoyed joining groups in extracurricular activities such as going climbing, playing soccer, or (attempting) to organize a frisbee game.

I have met with the LGBTuring group, continue to participate in the Joan Clarke Society on Tuesday mornings, and when possible contribute to the slack channel with opinions on decisions and events.

Interaction between cohorts has been an important part of feeling at home at Turing. Developing a solid relationship with other members of the school has been one of the highlights of my time spent here, strengthening my sense of community as a whole.

## Review

### Notes

* Strong assessment and diagnostic
* Early individual projects consistently have strong code
with some weaknesses in completion
* Hope to keep seeing the same level of quality but improve
on speed
* One point we discussed - being able to see "further down the road"
when planning projects -- this seems to produce better
results for you so let's keep working on it
* Individual work needs to show some improvement --
let's demonstrate this by taking an individual project
and revising it (probably Enigma)
* You seem to have very strong social engagement with the
cohort -- we would like to see this more in academic
environments as well

### Outcome

* End of Module Assessment: 4
* Individual Work and Projects: 2 -- Will revise this after Enigma revisions
* Group Work and Projects: 3
* Community Participation: 3
* Peer and Instructor Feedback: 3

ADVANCE, pending Enigma revisions
