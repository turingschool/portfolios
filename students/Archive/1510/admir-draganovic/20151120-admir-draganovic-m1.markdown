### Your Mission

My main goal for this module was to build a good enough foundation to help guide me through the remainder of the program. I feel like I came up a bit short of meeting my goals coming into the module so I will be repeating. I need to spend more time getting comfortable with ruby. I have learned a lot from both instructors and students this module but I could stand to gain a significant amount from taking the time to solidify my basic ruby skills.

Going into module 1 the second time around I am making it a personal goal to utilize the programming tools I have picked up in the last 6 weeks. I want to get better at my overall workflow and stress TDD. I know I have made a lot of progress and am happy with my decision to attend Turing but since I am not time constrained it is in my best interest to take an additional 6 weeks to meet my initial goal of having a good grip on ruby.

### End of Module Assessment

## Admir Mod 1 Assessment

 * Instructor:__ Horace

 * Result:__ RETAKE

Making progress overall, but fundamental concepts just aren't
as comfortable as we need them to be.

Would like to see Admir repeat and get some more repetition
with this fundamental material.

1. Ruby Syntax & API
 __2__: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

2. Ruby Style
__3__: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

3. Blocks & Enumerations
__2__: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

4. Testing
__3__: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

5. Workflow
__3__: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

6. Collaboration
__3__: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


### Attendance

I have not had an absence this module.

### Work

(Intro)

### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Draganovic/Jungle_Beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beats was using a linked-list to create an interactive drum machine.

Notes:

15 assertions, all passing.
Append method was really push method
used recursion for last node
all method doesnt work quite the way its supposed to
no pop method, insert or find.
Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 4

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Draganovic/enigma2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma involved building a tool for encrypting, decrypting and cracking an algorithm. This project was modeled after Alan Turing's enigma machine.

Notes:

five tests.
Crack does not work, encrypt does not work.
logic could be better broken out into classes.

Scores:

* Overall Functionality :1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style :3
* Test Driven Development :2
* Breaking Logic Into Components :3

## Team

### Projects

I paired with Jordan Lawler for HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me and I worked on Headcount individually.

#### (Http Yeah You Know Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/http_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

Notes:

20 tests, all passing.
Complete to iteration 4.
opportunities for refactoring for clarity,
some overly long methods.

Scores:

* Overall Functionality :3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style :3
* Test Driven Development :2
* Breaking Logic into Components :3

#### (Headcount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Draganovic/headcount)
* [Original Assignment]()

The Headcount project involved making Colorado School data located within CSV files searchable.

Notes:

Admir and Alex decided to split partway through the project and each work independently
The 2 projects reached a comparable level of completion -- still mostly working through some basic data processing for the first iterations
Struggles around workflow and process slowed down the project at the beginning
Main objective for next time around is to really hammer on fundamentals so that when we get back to this project we can move at a much more fluid pace


Scores:

* Functional Expectations 1
* TDD 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
* Enumerable & Collections 3
* Sanitation 3

### Giving Feedback

Below is feedback I have given to some peers.

Jordan Lawler- It was great having Jordan as a project partner not only because of his conceptual knowledge but also his general disposition. The HTTP-You-Know-Me project proved to be challenging and he was able to establish a good work pace and maintain a positive attitude. Working with Jordan was very beneficial for me, I was able to improve my approach to starting a large project after observing his pre project planning process. One of Jordan's strong points is his ability to communicate complex ideas. He is very good at methodically breaking down large problems into manageable and logical chunks. I have turned to Jordan many times during this module for programming related questions and general advice. He is alway willing to help and strives to fully grasp any challenge he takes on. My positive experience in working with Jordan during Module 1 is not unique, he has gone out of his way to impact the Turing community both in and out of the classroom because of his natural ability to collaborate with others.

JP-  Being in the same cohort as JP has been a great experience. I have not yet gotten an opportunity to pair with JP directly on a project but he has helped me on occasions where I have coded myself into a corner. JP is great at explaining complex ideas and is fully invested in being member of the community. I have benefitted most to his contributions to the classroom environment. JP is constantly engaged during lecture and is very on point with his responses and questions. He has the ability to carry his positive outlook into situations that can easily turn stressful. No matter how busy he happens to be JP will make time to help his peers and I am glad to have had the opportunity to build a friendship with him.

### Being a Community Member

Below is feedback I have received from peers.

Jordan Lawler - I have had the pleasure of  working closely with Admir at Turing since the beginning of module 1 in a wide variety of projects/exercises.  Admir’s determination to not only work to meet expectations on a surface level, but to truly understand the underlying ideas and logic of programming and CS is incredibly inspiring and infectious. Where others say good enough Admir insists on re-examination, I do not think there was a weekend where Admir did not make it his goal to review previous projects or extra-curricular material. In addition to this, Admir is incredibly resourceful (something most of us struggle with), and is quick to share his findings to the group.   These two attributes in conjunction have undoubtedly made the cohort as a whole stronger both in regards to conceptual understanding, and work-environment.
Pairing with Admir has been one of the most enjoyable experiences at Turing so far.  His calm demeanor, attention to detail, and insistence on clarity of code and process were paramount in our success with HTTP YouKnowMe.  In a pairing environment I do think Admir can be more pro-active in his communication, and confident in his assertions (as they are usually spot on!).

Emily Blanchard- Admir Draganovic is that guy I see first thing every morning. He is busy working, but always makes time for a hello, a smile, and frequently a short conversation. He inspired me to make the time to get a mentor, even if I still don’t have a set schedule yet.  I will have it  soon, due to witnessing Admir’s drive. Mr.  Draganovic and I both had our struggles and triumphs as coding beginners. Both of those good things were easier to deal with with a friend like Admir. I look forward to working and playing more with him in the future.

JP Perry- "Having had the opportunity to get to know Admir over the past 6 weeks has been a true pleasure. Admir has shown himself to be consistently positive, outgoing, and supportive of everyone in our cohort. He is approachable and eager to engage people and pair. I look forward to having the opportunity to work with Admir on a larger project as, when we've had the chance to interact on exercises, he's proven to be a great communicator and positive force. I can safely say that Admir is a true example of what makes the Turing community unique and amazing!"

### Playing a Part

I participated in the Turing community in the following ways:

* I am currently speaking to founders of Refugees on Rails in Berlin to see if I can assist       with an outreach project or equipment drive.
* I made myself available to my peers.
* I supported community members by attending Turings first LGBT event.
* I try to do one small thing a day that benefits someone else at Turing.
