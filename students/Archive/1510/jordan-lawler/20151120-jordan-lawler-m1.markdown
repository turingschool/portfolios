###Your Mission

I have always been a dreamer, with my inevitable trajectory entrepreneurship as a means to build and release products and services that (hopefully) change our world.  Ideas remain just that without practical means of implementation, and Turing represents that next step for me.  Over the next 7 months here my goal is to pick up the skill-sets and ideas necessary to begin my journey to this goal.

##Team

###Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 1.


####Headcount:

[Github URL](https://github.com/stevepentler/Headcount-V2)

**Real-world data collection and analysis** Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

Assessed By: Jeff

#####Scores:

- Overall Functionality: 3
- Test-Driven Development: 3
- Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
- Enumerable & Collections: 3
- Code Sanitation: 4

#####Notes:

- Spec harness passes
- Felt the beginning of the project was slow to launch, once 0 was through, 1 was fast, 2 was slow, 3 was fast
- 158 tests pass
- Testing of features looks really solid, probably some space for more edge case testing
- Implementation looks good, small methods, clear code, etc
- For next time: analysis take a long time, especially iteration 2, dealing with NaN error, not clear where the intended difficulty is, what to do with the non-values, trash data, etc

##Giving Feedback

**Admir Dragonov:** "I have had the pleasure of  working closely with Admir at Turing since the beginning of module 1 in a wide variety of projects/exercises.  Admir’s determination to not only work to meet expectations on a surface level, but to truly understand the underlying ideas and logic of programming and CS is incredibly inspiring and infectious. Where others say good enough Admir insists on re-examination, I do not think there was a weekend where Admir did not make it his goal to review previous projects or extra-curricular material. In addition to this, Admir is incredibly resourceful (something most of us struggle with), and is quick to share his findings to the group.   These two attributes in conjunction have undoubtedly made the cohort as a whole stronger both in regards to conceptual understanding, and work-environment.
Pairing with Admir has been one of the most enjoyable experiences at Turing so far.  His calm demeanor, attention to detail, and insistence on clarity of code and process were paramount in our success with HTTP YouKnowMe.  In a pairing environment I do think Admir can be more pro-active in his communication, and confident in his assertions (as they are usually spot on!)."

**Emily Blanchard:** "Although I did not have the opportunity to work with Emily this module, pairing was not necessary to illuminate just how great an addition Emily is to the Turing community.  Whether spreading her infectious positivity throughout the group, introducing lunchgoers to new and addicting math based games, or asking important questions that may have not been addressed otherwise, Emily is always looking to improve herself and others around her.  I cannot wait to see what Emily does in the coming months at Turing and beyond!"

**Steven Pentler:** "Steve is a detail oriented thinker that utilizes tools/techniques/ideas efficiently and adeptly to the benefit of everyone around him.  Whether it be building out tests before diving into a complex problem to set expectations and benchmarks for progress, utilizing the whiteboard for large conceptual ideas, or breaking responsibilities up in pairing to make for more efficient work time, Steve’s workflow and insight save time in the back-end by valuing work in the front.

Outside of a technical environment Steve is incredible to collaborate with.  His combination of adeptness, easy going temperament, and incredible work ethic allow the team to expend energy on the problem at hand rather than dynamics of teamwork/workflow.  Steve utilizes patience and demonstration as a teaching/mentoring tool rather than explanation,  allowing for teammates to make mistakes, then present a process that illuminates the correct path.

I think Steve would benefit greatly from removing himself from pre-planning process in the context of practice.  While his ability to conceptually navigate relationships between classes/methods is proficient, his efficiency has room for improvement.  This should allow for him to work within the macro of a project in a quick, efficient, and accurate way when paired with his pre-existing skill-set."


##Getting Feedback

"Jordan is a visionary that conceptualizes relationships/implementation at an alarmingly fast rate. Jordan synthesizes information and is able to architect intelligent design decisions based on future implications. I’m blown away by his abilities. In addition, he has sacrificed a significant amount of his time during headcount and other projects to help myself and other groups. He isn’t content until everyone can explain what he’s taught them in their own words. I’m convinced that law of diminishing returns doesn’t apply to Jordan, because he is equally pleasant and adept 10 hours into programming as he is in the first.

Jordan is aware of his need for growth in step-wise test driven development. Each time we went to the drawing board, pseudo-coded, or used test-driven development, he raved about the productivity and benefits. However, he has a tendency to be swept away by his vision and outpace his safety nets. I would recommend that he commit to testing first and tracking his time spent using pry. Identifying errors with solid testing, ex “what class is being output” could diagnose a lot of the problems that we had as a group. Ultimately, he is exceptionally enjoyable to work with and our morale has been the highest among groups." **--Steven Pentler**

“I have not yet had the pleasure of working on a project with Jordan, but I look forward to that happening soon. Mr. Lawler has an amazingly quick brain, with enthusiasm to match. His energy is contagious. Jordan’s skill set is varied and deep: musician, lover of puzzles, empathetic/sympathetic, coding, coolness, a desire to always improve in everything. One reason I’m so glad to have chosen Turing is meeting people like Jordan Lawler, that I might not have met under other circumstances." **--Emily Blanchard**

"It was great having Jordan as a project partner not only because of his conceptual knowledge but also his general disposition. The HTTP-You-Know-Me project proved to be challenging and he was able to establish a good work pace and maintain a positive attitude. Working with Jordan was very beneficial for me, I was able to improve my approach to starting a large project after observing his pre project planning process. One of Jordan's strong points is his ability to communicate complex ideas. He is very good at methodically breaking down large problems into manageable and logical chunks.

I have turned to Jordan many times during this module for programming related questions and general advice. He is alway willing to help and strives to fully grasp any challenge he takes on. My positive experience in working with Jordan during Module 1 is not unique, he has gone out of his way to impact the Turing community both in and out of the classroom because of his natural ability to collaborate with others." **--Admir Dragonov**

“Jordan is a huge asset to our class. He’s brilliant and is always willing to share his time to help other students puzzle through tough concepts. His enthusiasm is contagious and inspiring, and I really look forward to learning more from him as time goes on!" --Penney Garret

"Meh, He is alright." **--Jordan's Mother**


##Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

####Current:
- Provide help with projects/problems when needed/possible.
- Meet with Simon Taranto and Rolen Lee every week.

####Future:
- I am planning a student led session for next module on Max/MSP.
- I would love to get involved with the young entrepreneurs.  As someone who would have loved to attended this type of program as a kid, it is a cause that resonates with me.
