# Jordan Lawler (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to explore in Module 4.  Whether this took form in deciding to go the Javascript route in scale-up, or building out a music recognition app (with questionable results) for the web-sockets project, I feel like I did accomplish this.

## End of Module Assessment:

Points: 95 out of 125

## Mock Assessment:

Points: 50 out of 100

This assessment was initally a very low point for me, I knew that I could do much better than I had. I was beginning to think I was getting anxiety when asked to do something code based in a timed setting and this comfirmed it. The past few weeks I have been working on ways to not panic like I did and it has been largely successful.

Solutions include:
- Taking a step back and looking at the problem before diving in.
- Using paper and whiteboard to troubleshoot and plan.
- Letting tests drive (still working on this one)
- Not pshycing myself out before through taking a walk or distraction.
- Staying away from things like caffiene that may put me on edge.

## Individual Work

### IdeaBox 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1510/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0/jordan-lawler.md)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

146/150 Points

I did not meet with an instructor for the evaluation, Steve graded it remotely so I did not verbal feedback.

##### Real-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1510/module_4_assignments/real-time/jordan-lawler-real-time.md)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

82/200 Points

Rather than do the vanilla version of Real-Time I asked to do a modified version which still relied heavily on websockets, but rather than host surveys, to achieve music recognition.  This was a risk, I did not entirely know what the process for recognition would look like, and it would not be a simple task to introduce an interface that held particular practical value in the time allotted.  Music fingerprinting and recognition is something I have wanted to explore since before Turing so I took the risk so I took the plunge.

In terms of the rubric I was not successful (cross that out, it was an unmitigated disaster). The interface was non-intuitive, the code was not tested due to having to get the recognition working, and it was prone to bugs in certain situations.  

In terms of personal achievement I could not be happier with what I accomplished in the time I did. When running properly the app can actually recognize music that has been fingerprinted to its database! I learned a ton in regards to Redis, the positives/negatives of websockets, DSP with Javascript, the shortcomings of time driven audio events rather than byte-based, and fell in love with node in the process.

On paper this was the worst I have ever done by a substantial margin on a project at Turing. Personally it is one of the coolest things I have built... ever. I will continue to improve upon it, and it represents a side project I am passionate to talk about with employers and others in general.

*I will be completing the real life version of real-time over the course of next week to fully fulfill my requirements of graduation.*

## Team

This module I worked with Toni on Game-Time, and Dad-Steve on scale-up. In both cases I could not ask for better partners.

### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

#### The Low-Down:

Me and Toni built a tower defense game for Game Time. The project ended up being VERY object oriented and as a result a great way to dive into JavaScript.

#### Toni: The Legend.

Me and Toni represent very different types of coders which is the thing I love about pairing (whats the point otherwise?).  She forced me to commit early and often, and would never let us move forward without writing tests. I distinctly remember saying to myself about halfway through: "You mean we just have 100% test coverage at... all times??, THATS INCREDIBLE!!!

#### Functional Expectations

* 35 points** - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

#### User Interface

* 15 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* 25 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 20 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 25 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 15 points** - Zero complaints


#### Scale-Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1510/module_4_assignments/scale-up/son-jordan.md)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1510/module_4_assignments/scale-up/whiskey-tango-submission-form.markdown)

##### The Skinny:

Me and Steve were sick and tired about never taking our pomodoro breaks, an electron app seemed like the perfect way to fix that problem! We proceeded to engage in hostel UI/UX to lock the user out of their computer during their pomodoro ensuring that those precious break minutes were taken.

##### Steve: The Father-Figure

Obviously me and Dad-Steve have worked together in the past. Body-Count hardened turned our soft Turing n00b hearts to stone, yet one of us came out with a father, the other with a son.  It was actually pretty cool to work together with him on the last group project as I got too see how much Steve has grown as a programmer, and how we both have grown as effective members of a team.  The process was much less painfull with Scale-Up, we found ourselves making smart decisions the first or second attempt at a feature, and not the 300th time. This project was one of the highlights of Turing for me.

##### Participation:

* 30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.

##### Risk-Taking:

* 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

##### Blog:

* 0: I did not do the blog post. I thought it was worth less points. This was a regrettable decision on my part and I hit myself every day about not doing it.

### Giving Feedback

###### For Dad:

"Dad…. DAAAAAD….DAD. .. D…. da….daddy…..daaadddddd

This sound can be heard every morning as I try to wake my lazy dad up to come to school with me. A lot of people think he is a helicopter parent but truth is I like having him around at school. He makes a kick-ass sack lunch and he makes sure I don't burn myself by drinking too hot of coffee.

During the scale-up project, me and Dad worked like bread and butter. Me… the backbone, structure, vision, and all around nutrition of the toast, and my Dad, the caloric, fatty, icing on the cake that may even be fake butter but you don't say anything in an attempt to not offend.

JK lolz, Steve-Dad was awesome to work with as always, and I couldn't think of a better partner to finish up my Turing career, than the one that I started it off with. We created Github 2.0 together. We started the portfolio Dad-Son saga (that has now reached its logical end), and most importantly we created an inseparable bond together through playing ball in the backyard, and spending time in the wood shop for the box-car derby. (the box-car was slow, but it was OUR box-car god damn it!)"

###### For Wheat-Queen:

"Beth Beth Beth, her name rhymes with meth. Coincidence? YOU DECIDE!" (note, this is a result of a 7 month long struggle with my arch nemesis. Just like Batman could not exist without the Joker, I cannot exist without Beth)

###### For Greenspan-The-Man:

"Aaron Greenspan. What can we say about Aaron Greenspan?

Visionary? Maybe.

A great dancer? Absolutely.

A face chiseled by the gods? By god why not!

But why I have gathered you today is to talk about Aarons ability to drive his peers towards their passions, towards finding the better coder within them, and all the while doing it in a supportive,  maternal-like fashion that is truly a pleasure to be apart of.  Greenspan-the-man (patent pending on the name) should be ushered to the echelons of a team where he can undoubtedly deliver an amazing product and make the people who made it more amazing in the process.

Did I mention A-a-rons dance moves? We are actually going clubbing next week. Not a big deal."

###### Uncle Slota:

"I had the privilege of working with Uncle-Slota on Refactor Tractor. For those of you who do not know what refactor-tractor is, it is on of the most grueling projects here at Turing. I would have not made it through without Slota's determination, good spirit, and insight into how to not pass too many arguments into a javascript function. Everytime we would hit a brick wall, I would channel my inner 'lets gooooooo' and we would push through.  When it was all said and done, our pull request to the refactor tractor lesson was so good, Meeka merged it without even knowing it. I think she thought it was written by an instructor it was so perfect."


### Being a Community Member

###### From Uncle-Slota:

"Before the ages of Slota as a real world software developer he was just nucleus under the grand tutelage of Jordan “son” Lawler.  Working on refactor tractor with him was an honor and a duty I did not take lightly. Although before and during I did not want to take the journey that was reminiscent of Lord of the Rings episode 1 where they’re walking around those mountains and you’re like I would definitely die if I were there and this is nuts. But just like in the movie where Gandalf pushes them to the best of their abilities so does Jordan. In fact he’s just like Gandalf where he is the grey in episode 1 and then comes back all white in episode 2 because he’s like reinvented and stuff. That’s like Jordan, continuously creative and reinventing himself daily like Gandalf the white who plans the whole take down of Sauron."

###### From Dad:

"Jordan, you've always been my favorite son, and I want the entire world to know that I wouldn't trade you for 6 fattened calves and a team of strong oxen.

It means so much to me that you brought up the great memories of the box-car derby. I've never felt so inadequate as a father, but I hope you understand that I widdled throughout the night to make that car as fast as my aging hands could make it. I tried my best, which often wasn't enough, and I'm sorry for that.

But my shortcomings as a father have made you a very strong programmer. Your creativity and technical savvy make you the jaguar of the software jungle.

In all seriousness, it was an honor to team up with you for the scale up. I had a great time and am always astonished at how fast you can grasp new concepts. You learned React on the spot, and well enough that you could speak to performance and convention. Your Git workflow still sucks, but don't go changing. You didn't write a 60 point blog post - might as well just punch yourself in the balls. Speaking of which, thank you for introducing me to the Eric (&) Andre Show.

Anyway, it was destiny that we were paired together for Body Count and were screaming profanities at Jai while running git reset --hard HEAD~3 at 3:30AM before the deadline. Somehow we managed to pull it off, among other things. If I ever want to start a business, I'll call someone who is more organize than you. But then I'll call you. Keep drafting up crazy ideas and you're going to kill it you wild and crazy unicorn.

Whose your daddy?" -Dad

###### From Mejia:

"Hey, Jordan. I'm a little hesitant to send you feedback after something I think I saw/heard Thursday. You and Steve P were joking about and mocking the silverware drive. That on its own isn't too bad but I also saw you put a fork into your backpack. Kind of not cool. Was that even your fork? I really hope this is some sort of misunderstanding."

###### From Wheat-Queen:
"Jordan Jordan Jordan. My arch-nemesis at Turing. He tried to bring me down, but he has failed."

![The Death of Jordan](http://i.imgur.com/3s69Lte.jpg)

###### From Meeka:

"I remember when Jordan came into class the first day, I was thinking: 'This man is an idiot.' Well it's been six weeks and I can assure you that he is most certainly... An idiot.  I literally have nothing good to say about Jordan’s programming abilities or personality. Jordan has a great head of hair. There. I said something."

"Also: I’m starting to suspect he may only be ironically good at karaoke"

(this is actually true, although the ironic part is more ironic than you know: For someone who spent the last four years of their life recording people through microphones, I apparently lose all idea of how they operate when I am given one and proceed to scream into the microphone as though amplification is not its job already.)

### Playing a Part

I participated in SAB for my second term with no other than the legendary Beth Sebian.  I love Beth, and could not think of a better person to be part of SAB, so it was a great module to say the least.  I think my favorite part of SAB is the appreciation you gain for all that Turing does to be pro-active about student issues to offer the best experience possible.

Also: It is incredible how students can complain about a system, then have the system changed as per suggestion, and then revolt against the change like it is my 5 year old self eyeing down a bowl of sushi (I was an idiot).

Also Pt.2: Steve in Meeka did an incredible job. Me and Beth felt guilty at SAB some weeks because we literally had nothing to say but "everything is great... for almost everyone". People seemed happy with the support received with the job search, and the instruction was top notch.
