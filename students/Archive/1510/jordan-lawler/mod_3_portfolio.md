#Jordan Lawler - M3 Portfolio

##Your Mission:

###Module 1 Mission:
I have always been a dreamer, with my inevitable trajectory entrepreneurship as a means to build and release products and services that (hopefully) change our world. Ideas remain just that without practical means of implementation, and Turing represents that next step for me. Over the next 7 months here my goal is to pick up the skill-sets and ideas necessary to begin my journey to this goal.

###Reflection upon that goal:
I think Turing has prepared me for my goal more than I could have ever guessed.  I feel incredibly empowered by my education and have the confidence I could solve any challenge thrown at me given the time and resources to do so.  One thing that I did not expect was to enjoy code just for the sake of code.  I am delighted when I achieve a optimal refactoring, and I love the tiny puzzles that each piece of code represents.

##Attendance

I was late a few days, almost every one a Friday morning. This is something I would like to improve upon next module.

##Projects:

###Personal:

####Rales Engine

repo: https://github.com/jlawzz/rales_engine

Assessor: Lovisa

#####Notes:
5 failing tests in the spec harness
good API design, restful
controller tests, only class methods in the models which are caught
good use of Ruby in the tests to iterate over results and make assertions
very well factored code

#####Scores:
completion: 3
test-driven-development: 3.5
code-quality: 4
api-design: 4
queries: 4

#####API Curious:

repo: https://github.com/Jlawlzz/api-curious

Assessor: Lovisa

Notes:

Awesome UI Used Google OAuth and SoundCloud OAuth No tests!! Decided to continue working on functionality instead of testing In need of some refactoring Developer took risks and managed to get the a working implementation of his idea

###Team:

####Self-Directed Project

#####Taylor Moore & Jordan Lawler:

repo: https://github.com/Jlawlzz/personal-project

instructor: Josh M.

notes:
Integrating 3 services and sending data between them.
Clean code for the complexity.

#####Scores
completion: 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
test-driven-development: 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
code-quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
user-experience: 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
performance: 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

####The Pivot:

#####Group: Brant Wellman & Jordan Lawler & Charissa Lawrence

Client Assessor: Josh M. Technical Assessor: Lovisa

GitHub: http://github.com/jlawzz/the_pivot

Production Link: fast-mountain-92018.herokuapp.com

Client Notes: Several features broken in production. tests: very nice abstractions and testing patterns. Nice balance between model tests and feature tests models: overall nice, small methods controllers: clean controllers, logic was either pushed down or extracted to a private method views: great use of partials

#####Scores

######Client Scores

Completion: 2: Team completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
Organization: 3: Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
User Experience: 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
Extensions: 2: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.

######Technical Scores

Test-Driven Development: 4 - good tests, good patterns within the tests themselves (Use of Ruby to facilitate testing)
Code Quality: 4 - Good use of presenter patterns, implemented a worker, the auction (main part of the app) was very involved.
Git Workflow: 3 - nice use of PR's, be mindful of commit messages and consistent use of pull requests within the team (commenting etc)

###Giving Feedback:

######For Brant Wellman:

I had the opportunity to work with Brant on the pivot project. What is immediately apparent when working with Brant is his ‘team above self’ mentality that is infectious and immediately apparent.  Although we were using my little shop project, he grew to know the project intimately incredibly quick.  He would finish my thoughts when suggesting an idea and seems to have an intuition to the structure and overall flow of the code.

I hope that in future pairings Brant pushes his vision and opinions of code format harder.  He has excellent insights in this area, and the code would benefit greatly from him taking the helm so to speak. My second piece of criticism falls in line with the first. I think (much like many people here at Turing) Brant has a lower perception of his coding ability than reality.   Brant deserves to show more confidence in himself and his code in the future. He consistently writes clean, smart code!

######For Taylor Moore

I worked with Taylor on the “Personal (not so much personal I guess) project”.  Taylor is a passionate visionary who contributes to all aspects of the project.  Taylors strongpoints include conceptual planning,  code implementation, and effective communication.  Decisions on code architecture are debated and strengthened through discussion with Taylor, ensuring the structure of code is moving in the correct direction the first time more often than not.  This attention to detail carries into code implementation as well.  As  a team member, Taylor works hard and positively, his passion for the project pushes the team through difficult times.

My two criticisms for Taylor are:
1. Focus on the now rather than future implementation (something I struggle with as much as he does)
2. Get Sleep!  When Taylor gets tired, he begins to space out and wander, ending earlier in the night for more sleep may be more beneficial than pushing through the extra hour or two the night before.

######For Beth Secor

When Beth is your enemy in Catan she is a tyrant who's unchecked aggression is not and should not be tolerated.  She hordes the wheat and brick and is always planning behind your back while agreeing to a 'truce' to your face.

###Recieving Feedback:

######From Brant Wellman
"I really enjoyed working with Jordan as a team member on the Pivot. He has a playful energy that keeps everyone engaged in what they are working on. Jordan is a "dreamer" - he sees the big picture well and quickly picks out a path to the solution. He is passionate about his work and his code; this is a great personality to have on your team, as it drives you (me) to work harder and do more. Jordan should also be aware of his "dreamer" qualities and how they can affect team and project management. Sometimes it's necessary to get "into the weeds" so that you can see the little pieces and how they fit together to form the bigger picture so that you can effectively make decisions about process and time management."

######Jordans Mom
"eh"

######From Taylor Moore
"Jordan and I are both macro thinkers. We spent a lot of time talking about the best way of approach the project. Although this can be a good strategy, it's not sustainable or efficient. I would say Jordan could work on getting small steps done and to keep moving forward(something we both could work on). Jordan's communication and attitude is fantastic. He stays positive an will work through long hours in the night. I am excited to continue to work through this project and learn with Jordan."

######From Beth Secor
"Jordan made probably the dumbest move in Catan history by building 4 roads just to cut off Greg, but I admire his bold recklessness. I would definitely pair with Jordan again in Catan, we paired so well that we didn't even have to speak to each other to know what move we were going to make next. Team Target will win next time for sure."

###Playing a Part:

This module I saw my role switch dramatically in the community as I began my first of two terms as the SAB representative for Module 3 along with Brenna.  From what is groaned about by SAB members on a regular basis I had less than stellar expectations for what was in store but I was pleasantly surprised.  I am looking forward to part two of my SAB experience!

Fulfill my Dad Steve's empty shell of a life through time together. He lives his sad meaningless life vicariously through me. Its not easy, but he gives me a weekly allowance of 5$, as a 12 year old, thats a lot of money!!!!!! I participate in Kids who Kode. Not as a teacher. As a kid who kodes.

Provide assistance to puny module 1'ers who feel lost in the whorlpool of vanilla ruby.
