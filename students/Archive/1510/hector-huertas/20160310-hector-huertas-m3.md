# Hector Huertas - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My wish after Turing is to be a truly excellent well-rounded programmer.

As that wish includes many factors out of my control, and I believe that personal
goals should depend only on oneself, my mission is to fulfill these requirements:

* Extreme dedication
* Always choosing out of comfort-zone tasks
* Focus on social, collaborative and community related aspects of programming

I am very happy with my attitude this module, and hope to keep the same in the future.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessor: Josh Mejia/Lovisa

#### Notes:

* API: index/show/delete works. However, the response shouldn't be nested under an `items` key
* The Api controller looks good, very clean Rails
* Search: Single search works, multi search does not work
* Very good tests, thorough. Tests on the search is a bit light. Some of the values for the search is not tested.

#### 1. Ruby Style and Syntax

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* **3+: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3+: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

#### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**
* 2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but most new lines of code are not tested.
* 0: Developer does not use tests.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

###### Scores:

Client Scores:
* Completion - 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization - 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* User Experience - 2+: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
* Extensions - 3: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

Technical Scores

* Test-Driven Development: 4 - close to 100% test coverage, nice balance between feature tests and unit tests.
* Code Quality: 3 - Views look good, models are clean, some controllers could have been abstracted out to improve readability, overall very solid.
* Git Workflow: 4 - Nice commit messages, worked off branches and properly used PR's.

##### Feedback

* John Slota: Hector has a mind for development. Throughout my time in 1510 he asked some of the best questions showing that he thirsted for a deeper understanding of rails and ruby. I specifically remember on the Pivot that we were having issues with our asset pipeline. We couldn’t get our images deployed correctly at first. At that time Hector has us step back and talk about exactly what the asset pipeline was doing. At this time with him teaching us about the pipeline and reminding us of how it worked he finally realized that we had to clobber and pre compile. We did that and got the job done. Hector had many times like this where we were stuck and he used his deeper understanding of rails to move us forward. He also is a blast and a fun guy to work with too!

* Steven Pentler: I’ve spent a month of my life with Hector Huertas, and I still love the guy. We transitioned from a LittleShop team straight into a Pivot team. He was impressively receptive to the feedback I gave him following Little Shop: to communicate his preferences in a less challenging way. Over the course of the Pivot, he communicated very effectively, and I grew to love his catch-phrase “That’s Em-paw-saw-ble.” He is remarkable foresighted  when designing the back end for projects, and his upfront thinking saves a ton of time. Finally, he doesn’t practice his catch-phrase. If you tell him something is impossible, he’ll go out and do it. I have an immense respect for his capabilities, and he was fantastic to work with.

##### DTR

1. How will members communicate - Slack is fine, Hector and John prefers face to face

2. What do people want to work on? Steve - Wants to do things besides views, poros, Hector and John - want to do views, Hector wants help so that he’s not spending time on figuring out little things, John agrees, Hector is not as worried on background stuff, John - Views and Javascript implementation

3. Git workflow - Steve and Hector worked together last project, getting the branch, make changes and pushing up, want to continue the workflow, fetch the branch, someone who is going to merge pull requests should make sure all tests pass, John - not as comfortable with the merging pull requests, will learn with group

4. If we run into a problem - Steve - views are tough, won’t have all solutions Hector - we should not lose time trying random stuff, if we can’t figure it out let’s ask for help, John - ask for help after 15 minutes

5. Delivering Feedback - Steve - First Friday everybody wrote personal feedback, if you have something to say let it out, Hector - No criticisms from last project, providing feedback is important and sometimes it’s hard, but just come up with something to help people improve and that’s critical, Hector and John might need a reminder mid week to give some feedback,

6. Should know about styles - Hector - received feedback that could express himself less emotionally, so please let him know when he gets excited, Steve - If takes over backend, check in with us a bunch, John - laid back, excited to organize project, might become distanced if project breaks down, please let know in person with issues, Steve- less feature-full app, group agrees on solid code then creative code

##### Notes
 Definitely understands Rails and the big picture. Starting to ask the right questions about performance. Would like to see more use of POROs instead of hashes.

### Giving Feedback

Steven Pentler:
* Steve is the hardest guy to give feedback to. His soft skills are so extremely good that there is nothing to say, but his technical skills are very well rounded too, and always improving. The most impressive thing is how he uses those skills to build amazing products. Not apps, or webpages, he builds full-fledged products that customers would love. The only feedback I can give is: don’t fall asleep. Keep improving those technical skills so you are able to give birth to those amazing ideas in your mind. And never stop smiling!

John Slota:
* John is the bomb! It is an unlimited source of energy. It is a real pleasure to work with him. After two weeks I was still surprised of his continuous good vibe, even in the hardest moments of the project. I truly appreciate his ability to keep the team happy and productive. On top of that, he is able to produce an insane amount of good code very fast, it is quite hard to keep up with his production rate.  As constructive criticism, I think he could use a small reflexive pause when he founds a problem. Sometimes he goes down a road too fast before considering other (maybe better) options, but whatever road he chooses, he is able to find a way to make it work very fast. I think he is an extremely well rounded programmer that is going to make some company very very happy
