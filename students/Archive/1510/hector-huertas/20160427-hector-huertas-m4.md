# Hector Huertas - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My wish after Turing was to be a truly excellent well-rounded programmer.

As that wish includes many factors out of my control, and I believe that personal
goals should depend only on oneself, my mission was to fulfill these requirements:

* Extreme dedication.
* Always choosing out of comfort-zone tasks.
* Focus on social, collaborative and community related aspects of programming.

I totally accomplished the mission! I am really proud of my attitude during the whole program and am extremely happy and satisfied with my programming skills. I feel totally ready to conquer the world.

### Attendance

100% attendance while I was in Denver, with a couple of late mornings.

### Receiving Feedback

Marlo Major
* As one of my first AirBnB guests, I have to say I’m incredibly lucky to have ever met Hector. Working with him has been eye opening to say the least. His ability to break down even the most complex problems and think with such clarity is unparalleled and a characteristic I aspire to have someday. He really tries to dig deep into the problem and find the root of the situation, versus building some patch to fix the symptom. I want to learn how to program like Hector. He is the best partner I’ve ever had on a project and someone that was super exciting to work with. His energy is something everyone should get to experience, at least once in their lives as it’s so exciting to be around. I would work with him again in an instant as he has also become one of my closest friends at Turing. Something that he can improve is his dislike for taking small breaks throughout. This can be a strength in some aspects, but I would hate for him to burn out on large projects over long periods of time because he works so long and so hard. I marvel at the intensity of his work ethic, but I do believe it would serve him well to catch his breath after practically sprinting a marathon. Hector has been a defining character in my life thus far and I hope I can be more like him. I mean that most ardently.

Steve Pentler
* I was first paired with Hector on a four man team during Little shop, and to be completely honest he had a bit of a reputation for being opinionated and slightly difficult to work with. As the team lead at the time, I scheduled in a mandatory feedback for the first Thursday in order to correct any workflow issues prior to the second week. I gave Hector the advice that he could attempt to convey his preferences with less emotion in order to prevent defensive reactions from his teammates. Now, the thing about advice is that you can take it or leave it.

* Hector pulled me aside that same day because he wanted to have a genuine conversation. Rather than defending himself, he continued to ask questions from a place of self-improvement. The next week he reacted to this feedback exceptionally well. With a more constructive, less emotional tone, he avoided “clashes” (with Aaron) and the entire group’s morale for the second week was lighthearted and fun.

* After the intermission, I was reassigned to a group with Hector for the Pivot. One month straight with the “Spanish Thunder.” He crushed the project and conveyed his points with his brain instead of his heart, and there was no longer a sense of pride in being correct all the time. He was an incredible teammate, and I can guarantee that Slota (the Pivot) and Marlo(GameTime) would say the same.

* Hector’s technical abilities have never been in question, though his soft skills have. I can testify to the progress he has made, and I can sincerely say that I would love to work on a small team with Hector for years. He doesn’t take shortcuts and if I ever needed anyone to design the back end of a project, no joke I would hit up Hector first.

* The entirety of 1510 is bummed that he couldn’t be with use these final weeks, but he’s as much a part of the cohort as any of us who are still standing at graduation. I wish nothing but the best for him, and hope our paths cross again (preferably in Europe for a UEFA Champions League game). Speaking of which, did you see  Ñíguez’s goal? “EM-PAW-SEE-BALL!!!!” jaja

John Slota
* Anyone who has met Hector knows about his energy, his fun loving attitude and his wit. I paired with Hector and had a great time doing that in Mod 3. This module I observed him partnering with Marlo during game time. I speak with Marlo quite frequently and Marlo had nothing but good things to say about the Alicantino. Marlo repeated 4 and told me that Hector was teaching him things he didn’t know. Another great thing about Hector is he knows his weaknesses. When we defined the responsibilities in our project together he came out and said his problem is that he can be strong headed. Although true, it really isn’t that much of an issue when working with him. I would actually say it’s a strength of his. When we were working I lead the team because it was my second time doing it. I had a vision, and when Hector disagreed with me, he would make it known and we would talk about it, normally going with Hector’s suggestion. With that being said, I consider Hector a friend, know he will do great things and can not wait to visit him and do some botellon en el castillo en Alicante.

### Giving Feedback

Marlo Major
* Spending time with Marlo doing whatever is a gift. He is my prototype of the successful person: cool, kind and smart. His mindset is so extraordinary that I don't know what to remark. His awareness of the current state of his life and the goals he wants to achieve allow him to keep making great decisions over and over, leveling up himself and controlling his own destiny. He will achieve whatever he desires. This, of course, includes being a phenomenal programmer. It is super easy to work with him, and I am really grateful he retake mod 4 so I could enjoy doing a project with him (sorry man). For actual programming feedback: before diving into implementing a feature/function/expression, it might be useful to think a little bit more on 'what do i want to do? / what do i need?' from a conceptual point. Being able to explain your idea in plain english without using any technical terms is a good starting point for writing the actual  -*insert language*- implementation.

Steven Pentler
* I can’t believe I spent a module without a project with Steve!! We talked a lot during game time though, and his programming style still inspires me. He has an amazing idea, and he follows it no matter what until he makes it real. Because of this he sometimes faces hard and uncommon problems, but the result is always amazing and super creative, and the learning is huge. I’ll try to mimic that spirit in my following projects. One thing I noticed is that sometimes he takes too much time before asking for help, and sometimes all the problem needs is another couple of eyes. I’ll be following Steve work closely, it’s gonna be extraordinary!

John Slota
* I want to work in the same company as John. He makes things fun and easy. I haven’t done a full project with him this module, but when we discussed about code in game time I could feel the same joy as in the pivot. We didn’t have many conversations like that in the pivot, considering the pros and cons of a given path, and I really like him thinking about tradeoffs before starting to crush features. I miss working with him. As constructive feedback, he could sometimes be more aware of when someone is not up to jokes and needs some ‘calm’ to recharge the batteries. I’m keeping one thing from him that I love: Let’s goooOOOOOOooooOOOOO!!!!


### Being a Community Member

Armstrong Posse for the win!!!

I have been promoting the Elixir language and functional programming among the Turing students.

* I have been leading the Armstrong posse along with Aaron Greenspan.

* I did student led sessions on Elixir on the two Fridays I was in Denver.

* Last but not least, I have been asking questions and giving my point of view on several JavaScript topics during the lessons, to try to give more presence to functional JavaScript.

Following  my personal crusade, I rescued several abandoned glasses when taking my own to safety.
