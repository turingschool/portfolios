# Hector Huertas - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My wish after Turing is to be a truly excellent well-rounded programmer.

As that wish includes many factors out of my control, and I believe that personal
goals should depend only on oneself, my mission is to fulfill these requirements:

* Extreme dedication
* Always choosing out of comfort-zone tasks
* Focus on social, collaborative and community related aspects of programming

I am very happy with my attitude this module, and hope to keep the same in the future.

### Projects

I completed the following team projects:

#### Traffic Spy

Team: Hector Huertas & Beth Sebian

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/traffic-spy-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/5cd41b3635cc4d32431032d42bcfc9f7da3135d5/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

Navigation tracking tool for companies to analyze client's behavior while browsing their site.

###### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra & Web Business Logic: 3.5
* View Layer: 3

##### Feedback

Hector was an invigorating partner to work with on TrafficSpy. He was engaged and committed to seeing the project through, and equally committed to making sure we both moved forward with a solid conceptual and technical understanding of what we were doing. Hector and I had a heated moment in the project where we disagreed about how to move forward with the database, but I found even this exchange valuable to our team, my learning, and our working relationship. Hector clearly articulated his priorities and made a case for his approach, and was consummately respectful as I did the same. I was much more motivated by having a partner who was committed and involved than put off by our difference in strategy. We compromised, moved forward, and met our goals for the work.

#### Hire my Tribe

Team: Hector Huertas & Steven Pentler & Aaron Greenspan & Joseph Perry

Marketplace for developers and contractors

###### Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 4 (lite) - All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
* Views: 4 - Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
* Controllers: 3 - Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
* Models: 3.5 - Models show satisfactory organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails featurescd
* Testing: 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
* Usability: 3 - Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
* Workflow: 3.5

##### Feedback

JP:
* I'm really glad we finally got a project to work on together. It's very easy to work with you, and I really appreciate that you don't get stressed out or frustrated easily. I'm also regularly impressed that you're such a strong developer when you're coding and communicating with us in a second language. I really don't have any serious constructive criticisms. If I had to choose something, I'd suggest that I'd love to see you plugged in to the big TV and leading when we work as a group more often. You've got really good ideas and you communicate well, so I'd be happy to see you driving more. I'm looking forward to finishing up this project together, and I'm really grateful I got such an awesome team for this!

Aaron:
* You have STRONG opinions about how code ought to be written, both on the screen and as a team.  This has been incredibly valuable in our group, and indeed is one of the things I look forward to most when working with you;  At the end of the day your ideas always have merit and are backed by a mountain of good reasoning.  As a result, you almost always force me to reconsider and dive in deeper to a concept I may have written off as ‘trivial’ or ‘uninteresting’ prematurely.  I will say, however, that you could definitely sugarcoat your ideas a bit more… Though I can (usually) take a comment like “No man that is absolutely wrong” in stride, I am sure others may be left reeling.  (For the record, I personally love it and usually start to grin when I know it’s going to get heated when you say something like that…)  Just be careful moving forward!

Steven:
 * I love your enthusiasm for the project, however when it comes to voicing opinions, I think you could work on communicating  it an a less enthusiastic way. You’ve proven that your opinions are generally correct, but voicing them in a low, calculated voice is much more effective and you’re less likely to be challenged.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Beth Sebian:
* Working with Toni was a pleasure. I learned a lot with her about both programming anBeth is one the people that I learned more from. She is great keeping the goals in mind in order to get the most growth from the work done.  I really enjoyed that she did not take anything for given and required good reasoning to incorporate ideas to the project, forcing me to give the most of myself. I also appreciated a lot that after our differences around the database, we could keep working really well, achieving great results.   As constructive criticism, it took me a little to understand her way of approaching the projects and how much value she gets from understanding everything as opposed to getting things done as soon as possible. I think is a really good and valuable approach and I feel that teams will benefit from her explaining this approach in a more explicit way.

Steven Pentler:
* Its difficult to find constructive feedback from you. Small things I can think are:
Getting faster with the editor, learning shortcuts and having more info on the screen will improve your productivity. Also relying less on live testing and more in the test suit will make you much faster. Thats all I got, its a pleasure working with you!

Aaron Greenspan:
* You are so good with code that overlook the benefits of “boring” conventions. I think they bring stability to the project because is easier to understand for everyone, making faster and easier maintenance. I have seen you typing super fast, and barely using shorcuts. You would be a productive machine if you learned those. I really enjoy working with you, keep up the good work!

Joseph Perry:
* Its a pleasure working with you.  I have a hard time finding constructive feedback to give you. I think you could benefit from using more shortcuts, since your typing is already fast. And another small thing is that sometimes you wait too much to ask for help. Specially with weird errors, I think is great to pick someone for a fast “do you see something weird here”? Your are an awesome partner, keep up the good work!

### Being a Community Member

Mary Beth Burch:
* I love doing warm ups with you, because you are always ready to dive into a problem and work with others. You bring a real sense of confidence to your programming.  My piece of advice would be to stay flexible and try solving problems in different ways. Sometimes during warm-up, I felt like you had a solution you knew was right (and it was), but it made it hard to try things in a way that might be different. I think you will be a strong mentor for new students!

### Playing a Part

I think this module I started to give back some of the support I got in the first module. I focused specially in 1511, helping them to feel part of Turing as soon as possible, and trying to use my experience to make their lives easier.

* I take every kind of feedback very seriously, doing my best to provide useful thoughts
* I've regularly helped 1511's to improve their programming skills
* I helped 1511's to understand Turing mission and to take a positive approach when trying to understand some of the hardest Turing experiences (failing, struggling...)
* I pick any abandoned glasses I see when on my way to return mine
* I put great care when using any resource
* I have attended a fair deal of DSA classes, as much as projects allowed me
