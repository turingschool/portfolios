# Beth Sebian - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

I want to be a solid programmer and a great teacher, and I chose Turing because it could help me become both of these things. Overall, I've had a much stronger grasp on material this module compared to last, which has fortunately given me more opportunities to teach and explore concepts with more confidence.

My main areas of focus this module have been comprehension and collaboration. I'm interested in comprehension of concepts/skills directly required as well as their relationship to peripheral ideas and tools. On the collaboration front, I made sure I contributed to the groups I worked in, communicated clearly, and established structure where needed.

Also of note this module, I made more time for side projects, including spending a good deal of time early in the module on [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bethsebian/bitcoin). I liked the chance to experiment with Ruby and the freedom to customize my application around the project's needs as I saw them. I leaned heavily on our instructor's resources when working to master concepts, but when it came to writing the code itself, I worked independently. The challenge was rewarding.

### Work

The project work below reveals some consistent themes across my work this module:
* Working knowledge of Rails, TDD and debugging with Pry and Byebug.
* Seeking experience in areas of weakness: testing with RSpec when given choice, creating additional Rails projects outside of class for extra repetitions.
* Continuing to struggle with style: tests are too verbose, methods could be cleaner, inadequate time spent refactoring.
* Collaborating effectively, demonstrating ability to lead projects, executing consensus goals, working well with others.

**Self-assessment**  
This was a seamless collaboration project. We stayed in close communication, reevaluated work plans and strategy, pretty closely arrived at a point when we could split off to work independently. I was battling the flu during the second week of this project: on the positive side, I think I was quick to jump in where I could and bit off realistic chunks of work that positioned my Jordan and Greg to do their work well. There were several times during the project where I could have communicated more clearly to them about the status of my work.


#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/traffic-spy-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/5cd41b3635cc4d32431032d42bcfc9f7da3135d5/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

**Requirements**

**My self-assessment**  
Hector and I focused on fundamentals on this project and prioritized comprehension and discussion over extensions. I was confident in our final product: it met the base expectations and was well-tested.

### Ruby Exercises

#### Bitcoin
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/bitcoin)  
* [Project Page](https://github.com/worace/coinage)  
Using Horace's coinage iterations as a guide, I've been working all module on simulating bitcoin's marketplace with my own cryptocurrency program. So far we've completed iterations 0 and 1, working on 2. I've built everything using TDD.

#### Mario Brothers
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/mario_brothers)  
The challenge was to write a method that would build a stack of "#" symbols that formed the shape of a ramp (climbing to the right). The method should take a number that dictates how tall and wide the ramp is. I build this in Ruby, and then used it as an opportunity to test my new Python skills after an afternoon Python workshop.

#### Base64 Coding Challenge
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/base64_challenge)  
This coding challenge was kicked off with 1 unexplained line of code `curl -fsSL https://www.vessel.com/careers/apply.rb | ruby`

### Giving Feedback
Feedback to peers in the 1510 cohort:
* [Hector Huertas](https://github.com/hectorhuertas): Hector was an invigorating partner to work with on TrafficSpy. He was engaged and committed to seeing the project through, and equally committed to making sure we both moved forward with a solid conceptual and technical understanding of what we were doing. Hector and I had a heated moment in the project where we disagreed about how to move forward with the database, but I found even this exchange valuable to our team, my learning, and our working relationship. Hector clearly articulated his priorities and made a case for his approach, and was consummately respectful as I did the same. I was much more motivated by having a partner who was committed and involved than put off by our difference in strategy. We compromised, moved forward, and met our goals for the work.
* [Jordan Lawler](https://github.com/Jlawlzz): "Jordan's a treat to work with. He is creative, motivated, and always seems to bring joy to the work. While working with Jordan on Little Shop, I've appreciated his ability to balance both an enthusiasm for the vision of where we're headed with a determined, detail-oriented focus about the small things that get us there. He has a great aesthetic too -- I've been thrilled that our project can benefit from his eye! On future projects, I'd like to see Jordan be a little more communicative when he breaks off to do work independently; he seems to work really well when he has an area he can focus on and build out, but his contributions here could be even stronger if he provided more regular updates to team-members so they can plan appropriately.""
* [Greg Armstrong](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong): "Greg is a solid team-member with valuable leadership skills. I've been especially impressed with his judgment around project flow and making decisions about how to spend our time, communicate, and divide work. I've also observed that Greg does a great job making space for his other teammates to flourish; he seems willing to adapt to strategies that he would not choose independently because they are a better fit for his teammates. This flexibility can bring exponential benefit to a team. He has a level-headed approach to the work, is clearly committed, but not zealous about it. While his versatility is a great asset, there are times when I think he could step in to redirect his teammates if he thinks they are spinning wheels, instead of withdrawing. It’s a delicate task, and should be undertaken judiciously, but I suspect he could do it convincingly."
* [Toni Rib](https://github.com/tonirib): "Toni's strength as a programmer is evident, as is her generousness with her time to assist other students, but what has especially impressed me is what a dutiful learner she is. I'm very familiar with practitioners who are so good they are unable to coherently explain the concepts behind what they do, but Toni is different. She is very conscious and conscientious about applying her skills as she tackles problems. For example, as someone who's had the chance to pair with her, I was impressed to see her predict out loud what tests would fail next and verbalize why. This approach permeates her work. This makes her a great teacher, but it also speaks to her capacity for learning and the integrity she brings to her work. I had respected her generousness and skills from afar, but after having a chance to work with her I have a deeper appreciation for her humility and dedication to our craft."
* [Lenny Meyerson](https://github.com/TheObtuseAutodidact/): Lenny is a too-modest classmate and teammate. His modesty is largely a strength -- it speaks to high standards, a commitment to doing good work, an interest in contributing to those around him. And it also speaks to his kindness and humility interacting with peers. I especially enjoyed working on a project with Lenny because of his focus on learning concepts and prioritizing comprehension over extensions. We agreed early into the project that that was our goal and stuck to that mission throughout our work. There are ways in which his humility holds the people around Lenny back, though, and I'd like to challenge him to look for more opportunities to serve his peers. I'm always grateful to the classmate that asks questions, insists on pausing until something is understood, and equips him/herself to teach those concepts forward. I think Lenny could be of great service to his peers here and after Turing if he specializes in the art of seeking seeking knowledge; instead of being timid, he should pursue his learning with confidence in service of his own education and those around him. He's in larger company than he gives himself credit for.

### Being a Community Member
Feedback from peers in the 1510 cohort:
* [Toni Rib](https://github.com/tonirib): "Beth, while often soft-spoken, is not afraid to ask for help or to ask the group to recap a difficult concept which is GREAT trait for anyone in a tech field. We worked together on the rails mini-project and I feel like I learned more because Beth made is slow down, go through each step incrementally, and had a really cool idea of rotating through our group of three to fix each individual error as it came up. I didn't think at first that I would like going that slow but I ended out liking it a lot because I feel like I learned more and like our whole group was engaged. She has great refactoring ideas, too. I think she's going to make a fantastic programmer and that she should learn to speak up even more in a group because she has great ideas."
* [Lenny Meyerson](https://github.com/TheObtuseAutodidact/): "The Rails mini project was quite short but Beth’s idea that as a short, non-graded project, our focus should be on learning rather than end product was exactly what I would have wished for. She approached the process as one to be untangled rather than a race to the finish line. I could not have asked for a better use of my study time.  Writing, reviewing, and discussing code was done with a determined calm that made the project feel like an enjoyable series of study sessions. I would enjoy working with Beth again in the future."
* [Hector Huertas](https://github.com/hectorhuertas): "Beth is one the people that I learned more from. She is great keeping the goals in mind in order to get the most growth from the work done.  I really enjoyed that she did not take anything for given and required good reasoning to incorporate ideas to the project, forcing me to give the most of myself. I also appreciated a lot that after our differences around the database, we could keep working really well, achieving great results.   As constructive criticism, it took me a little to understand her way of approaching the projects and how much value she gets from understanding everything as opposed to getting things done as soon as possible. I think is a really good and valuable approach and I feel that teams will benefit from her explaining this approach in a more explicit way."
* [Mary Beth Burch](https://github.com/mbburch/): “You work your ass off here. I so respect your dedication to all things Turing, and to doing everything you can to be an amazing programmer. Someday I’ll feel smart enough for DSA (or confident enough). It seems like you fly under the radar and stay humble about how solid you are. I always appreciate warm-ups with you (before our posse stopped showing up) because you ask good questions, and push others to work through things together. You’re willing to be honest with people and have hard conversations. I’m sad we never got the chance to pair on anything, and I hope we can still do your open data project together.”
* [Jordan Lawler](https://github.com/Jlawlzz): "I had the pleasure of working with Beth on the little-shop project.  Me and Beth have a polarized workflow in many ways that made the process and project much stronger than if we had not worked together.  Beth has an incredible respect for process, eye for detail, manages the team exceptionally, and shows efficiency in her ability to code.  Our team avoided many pitfalls from her sharp eye, and the brightest parts of our code came from her creative refactoring and understanding of rails responsibility and PORO’s. For future projects I think Beth could benefit from allowing team workflow to flow naturally, even if it veers from the process from time to time."
* [Greg Armstrong](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong): “I've really enjoyed working on the LittleShop of Orders (Apocalypsify version) with Beth. This project was a first for me in terms of large-scale branching and regular division of labor, and Beth was very communicative about what tasks she was undertaking while also quite good about creating pull requests to merge in new functionality when the time came. Her creativity and humor was a perfect fit for our shop’s subject matter and styling, and it made the work less tedious than some recent projects like TrafficSpy. One bit of constructive criticism I would add is that I would’ve enjoyed it if we had had more face-to-face pairing/team-coding on the project, but I understand that unexpected sickness and other obligations, such as pet at at home, can make that a bit difficult to organize and execute.”


### Playing a Part
I have been a solid member of the community, but have done little that's exceptional. I've prioritized staying sane and balanced, so that I can be available and responsive to my classmates -- it's a modest but important goal.  

I have a few community projects in mind that I'd like to tackle next module:
* Soliciting volunteers to discuss ways Turing could be more environmentally responsible
* Working with some other students in my module to organize a session for our cohort on "privilege"
