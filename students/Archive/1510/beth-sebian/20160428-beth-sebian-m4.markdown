### Work
This was my most holistically strong module in terms of individual work. I made better decisions around priorities on my projects, spent my time more efficiently, spent less time getting lost fixing bugs.

RealTime, although I didn't score perfectly, was a major success for me. Due to some personal commitments, I was unable to start the project until 2 days before it was due. I finished the project in a period of 15 hours in 2 dedicated work sessions. The project  had some gaps in testing, and we discovered a bug that surfaced during the evaluation, but I was very pleased with the product I developed in that amount of time. I was also pleased that I was able to debug the issue after my assessment.

#### RealTime

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Build a Node application that starts off just keeping all of the data in memory using local variables. Once you have the basic application up and running, you can use a simple key-value data store (like Redis, for example) to persist your data in the event that your process goes down or write the data to the file system. Build two applications: a Rails application that handles data persistence, providing an API, and serving static assets along with a Node application that focuses exclusively on pushing messages to client over a WebSocket connection.

**179 OUT OF 200 AVAILABLE POINTS**

* **Code Quality - JavaScript and/or Ruby (25):** Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.  
* **Client-Side Application (20):** Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.  
* **Test-Driven Development (25):** The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.  
* **Interface (4):** The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.  
* **Workflow (5):** The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

As part of the Whiskey Tango group, I chose to revisit the Police Data Tracker App I started in mod 4. I tackled some technical challenges with the project, but a good deal of my work was developing a strategy around the site and project as a whole: what data I wanted to cultivate, how to prioritize data, etc. Over the week, I completed the following tasks.

* Developed MVP vision: API-centric website, with professional data standardization and robust documentation.
* Identified resources for documentation, including Swagger
* Identified 15 datasets to develop first 5 (of 8) data categories. Required a couple hours of research exploring available datasets.
* Drafted columns for first data category table.

* **Blog Post (40):** Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.  
* **Participation (50):** Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.  
* **Risk Taking and Creativity (50):** Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature.  

## Team

### Projects

My work with Penney on GameTime was my only group project this module. We worked well together as a team, and I'm satisfied with the product we created. My highest success on that project was figuring out logic to auto-generate patterns for the game. It was a task that I started by writing on pen and paper for a couple hours, then took 5-6 hours to implement, simply following the directions I'd pseudo-coded.

### Giving Feedback

[Penney Garrett](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/) - Penney and I had the chance to work together on GameTime. It was by far my most enjoyable project at Turing, bringing a blend of challenge, creativity, and great teamwork, namely because I had such a great partner. A few things about Penney's work on the project stand out: first, she came to the project with enthusiasm and was intent on being successful. I saw that when she reached out to me before the project was officially launched with an idea for the game we could develop. She maintained this vision throughout the project. Second, she was well organized and purposeful about how she spent her time on the project, and always delivered the features she took responsibility for. I never had to worry that she would not hold up her end of the work. Third, she maintained a clear understanding of how the different parts of our project fit together, anticipated needs ahead of time, and communicated those clearly to me. I remember her spending time during a mid-project work session charting out the coordinates of our grid so that we'd have them well-documented in our app instead of rely on memory. Her attention to details like this made her vital to the work. // Aside from her technical and project management skills, I also know Penney to be an insightful, kind, lovely person -- that was the best part about working with her. I've harped here a bit about her technical capabilities because I don't think she gives herself enough credit for them. If I was managing a software project, I'd want Penney on my team both as an individual contributor, and as someone who would bring out the best in her teammates and elevate the dynamics of our group.  

[July Tran](https://github.com/julyytran) - This is the second module I've had a chance to work with July on extracurricular projects (environment variables, and Pahlka posse). She is motivated and energizes those around her -- it's been great to feed off that energy and see our work benefit from it. She demonstrates great care toward her fellow teammates and the welfare of projects, whether that's addressing an individual's need (is someone prepared for a leadership role) or a group need (suggesting we hold a posse retro at the end of the module). I'm excited to see where she lands after Turing -- the programming world will definitely benefit from her leadership and vision.  

[Christine Gamble](https://github.com/ccgamble): Christine has demonstrated a wonderful mix of professionalism, commitment, and curiosity during our work together in Pahlka posse. She rose early as our "maps" expert and has made an effort to help others in our group understand the mapping capabilities of our app. She's shown leadership by making recommendations about what mapping platform we should use. I also am very impressed by Christine's attitude -- she is active in our group, yet manages to engage in a relaxed and easy-going way. In that respect, I see her as a discreet leader whose done a lot to set a healthy tone for our group. She's been a huge asset to our team, and I expect she will continue to be of great service to others she works with.  

[Thom Picket](https://github.com/thompickett): Thom has been an absolute delight to work with in Pahlka posse. As one of the more senior students in our group, he was worked with new students to include them in our work and help them bridge gaps between the content they've learned and the work we're doing. His attitude and demeanor in meetings is casual and engaged -- a perfect mix that makes him easy to spend time with and work with. I've also had a chance to work with Thom in environment variables, and appreciate that he so readily voices ideas and feedback to ideas we're discussing. Because he is judicious about when he talks and what he says, he commands a good deal of respect from his peers.  

[Kerry Sheldon](https://github.com/kjs222): In the 6 weeks I've had a chance to work with Kerry in Pahlka posse, her strengths as emerging software developer have been evident. She is professional, engaged, and intentional in her contributions to our group. It's clear she is already a strong programmer, but I've found it especially impressive that she so tactfully uses these skills to advance the overall learning of our group. These soft skills, combined with what I expect will soon be some pretty badass software ninja skills, will make her a force to be reckoned with by the time she graduates Turing. I'm thrilled she's interested in working in the social justice/civic tech space and would be delighted to have a chance to work with her again.   

[Deborah Hamel](https://github.com/deborahleehamel): I've had a chance to work with Deborah through our work in Pahlka posse, and I've found her to be an engaged member of the team who elevates those around her. She is upbeat, dedicated but grounded, and enthusiastic about her work, all of which have had a positive impact on our team dynamic. I've also had a chance to interact with Deborah in environment variables and more casually as a fellow Turing student. I see her go to great lengths to support the students around her -- she does so in a genuine and authentic way that I find quite powerful. Turing is lucky to have her in our community.  

[Nicholas Dorans](https://github.com/NickyBobby): I've had a chance to work with Nick both in Pahlka posse and in environment variables. In both settings, his commitment to the group and the work is clear. He has a real talent, which he may or may not be aware of, of using his humor to both lighten the mood around a serious issue while simultaneously uniting the group around the issue. This is a delicate skill, and he's not always successful, but it's valuable enough that I hope he continues to refine his presence in groups to capitalize on those talents even more. I've thoroughly enjoyed the time I've had to work with Nick.  

[John Slota](https://github.com/slota): John's been a treat to work with in Pahlka posse and share a cohort with these past two modules. He is a genuine, easy-to-get-along-with guy, who strikes a nice balance of nerdiness about our work and high standards where it matters with a lightness that makes him fun and enjoyable to work with. I'm excited to be in this field in large part because of the opportunities I'll have to work with people like John.  

### Being a Community Member

[Penney Garrett](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/) - “There aren’t enough words in the dictionary to express how grateful I am to have been able to spend time with Beth working on a project this module. Beyond how much I like and respect her as a friend and colleague, her technical skills are downright incredible. I hope one day to be able to think through tough problems as effectively as she can. In a mere 36 hours Beth took our Game Time project from average to high-level professional, figuring out and implementing the algorithm to have levels auto-generate (something it took the original creator of the game over a week to do). Saying I’m impressed would be an understatement, and I know I am not alone in that sentiment. // But Beth isn’t just an incredible developer. She is an incredible person. The kind of person that has the ability to change the world in very real and meaningful ways. The majority of people at Turing have their hands more-than-full just balancing the course load, but Beth somehow managed on top of that to start the Environment Variables group, run student led sessions and a gear-up, and anchor a posse that is building a full-on app to help people find affordable housing. She is a huge inspiration to me and I truly hope we can continue to work together in our post-Turing lives. Whatever team she ends up working with in her professional life will incredibly lucky to have her."

### Playing a Part

I co-lead the environmental variables group, and have been an active facilitator of our Pahlka posse.
