# Marlo Major - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to focus on learning JavaScript and JavaScript only. Having been in attendance for the previous module 4, I wanted to prove to myself that I could learn a new language and not just be able to throw together some code, but to instead be able to understand and build well refactored, maintainable code. I started by installing a website blocker on my computer and deleting all frivolous apps on my phone. This has had a tremendous effect on my focus and ability to complete tasks in a timely, sensible manner. This is a habit that will stay with me, as I don't intend on returning to the life of Facebook popups, Snapchat messages, and Instagram infinite scrolling. There's enough life around me to keep me entertained forever. I intend on continuing to enrich my relationships and physical well being instead of social media presence. Focus has been my area of emphasis during this module and I have to say that I have achieved this goal successfully.

### Work

JavaScript is something that just didn't make sense to me during the previous module 4. No matter how hard I tried, function declarations and promises etc were concepts I just couldn't seem to incorporate into my coding ability. Coupled with a lack of focus and serious burnout, I ended failing module 4 greater than I've ever failed anything before in my entire life; I failed with a score below 50%. The following work signifies my dedication not to points, but to focusing on a given task and giving it my all because it is who I am and it is what I want to be known for.

### Gametime

* [Snake-Tron](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/snake-tron)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/game-time-starter-kit)

Snake Tron is a classic combination game. It combines the games Snake and Tron in order to add extra functionality and different playability. I was partnered with Hector Huertas on this project. This is the best code I have ever written...period. Please take a look!

MY score was 260/300

#### Team

I was paired with Hector Huertas on this project.

### Scale Up

* [Looking For](https://github.com/marlomajor/lookingfor)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)

Looking For is a consulting project that I collaborated on during week 4 of module 4. This was the week that I was offered a mid-level software developer position at Active Network so this was not my best work.

### Oregon Trail Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/oregon_sale)

Active Network is a SaaS company that uses Ruby and Rails 3 in order to accomplish business goals. I had been writing JavaScript for the previous 12 weeks so needless to say, my Ruby and Rails skills were a bit rusty. Meeka, Steve, and Josh Mejia came up with a project for me to build that encompassed my entire last week of the module and replaced the last project in module 4 known as Realtime. The purpose of this project was to use Bullet and Brakeman in order to find security vulnerabilities and inefficient code, all of which helped me to achieve my goal of getting accustomed to a foreign codebase written in Rails 3. During this project, Markus Olsen was of great help and let me know that Active in fact uses Brakeman, so I invested a considerable amount of time in learning this particular gem.

This project was particularly helpful because it is almost exactly what I will be doing at Active. My job will be to find and make efficient poorly written Ruby code and to increase security where needed. Since I will have to use Vim during my time at Active, I attempted to use Vim during the majority of this project, only to realize it slows me down tremendously (for now). Another interesting point in this project is the fact that many security vulnerabilities have to do with using an older version of software that should probably be update...due to security patches. There is a website called [CVE Details](CVEdetails.com) that has all of the security holes in many different forms of software. It doesn't provide one with a solution to fix these problems, but it does in fact provide some valuable information.

This project provided a pathway to understand a foreign codebase written by other people in the framework and language I will be using for my daily job, but it also helped me to realize that working with the codebase of a $1B market cap company won't be a walk in the park. There were many parts of this project that I couldn't change due to time constraints and version differences and it will be the same when working with a real codebase written in an older version of Rails.

I'm super appreciative of Meeka, Steve, and Josh Mejia for working to put something together for me that was similar to what I will be doing on the job. This project will be something I probably reference within the first month of working, in order to lessen the scale and see how things are operating. I'm thankful for the opportunity!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Turing is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know you want constructive feedback...but I can't think of anything right now. Too excited about graduating as a PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPER.

### Being a Community Member

Hector Huertas Feedback

      Spending time with Marlo doing whatever is a gift. He is my prototype of the successful person: cool, kind and smart. His mindset is so extraordinary that I don't know what to remark. His awareness of the current state of his life and the goals he wants to achieve allow him to keep making great decisions over and over, leveling up himself and controlling his own destiny. He will achieve whatever he desires. This, of course, includes being a phenomenal programmer. It is super easy to work with him, and I am really grateful he retake mod 4 so I could enjoy doing a project with him (sorry man). For actual programming feedback: before diving into implementing a feature/function/expression, it might be useful to think a little bit more on 'what do i want to do? / what do i need?' from a conceptual point. Being able to explain your idea in plain english without using any technical terms is a good starting point for writing the actual (insert language here) implementation.

Edgar Duran Feedback

      Marlo is one impressive person. I admire his drive and his ambition. He has been such a big help to me this module and I probably couldnâ€™t have done it without him. When I was struggling to understand JavaScript Marlo was one of the people that was able to help it click in my brain. When I had to write my first blog post ever I knew he was the person to help me not turn it a total turd. After finishing my blog post at around midnight I slacked Marlo expecting him to get back to me the next morning. Instead  he gave it a thorough review and sent me back the proof read that very night! I am excited for Marlo to begin the next phase of his career as I know he will be wildly successful. Thanks for everything, buddy.

Sonia Gupta Feedback

      Marlo has been incredibly helpful for me this module. I have been struggling a lot, and he took it upon himself to seek me out and offer me valuable advice related to programming and to life in general. He has also paired with me on several occasions. His teaching style allowed me to come to my own conclusions without feeling helpless. The emotional and academic support Marlo provided has contributed considerably to my progress, and I'm truly grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from him.

### Playing a Part

A defining difference between this module and the last is that I set out to help other people. For some reason, I was just in a dark place the last time I took module 4 and wasn't really interested in anyone's wellbeing, including my own. However, I quickly realized that you can find strength in others. So I essentially set out to be an emotional mentor of sorts to module 1 students. This is something that I hope I can continue beyond Turing. If we can ever set up an emotional mentor situation, I'd honestly love to be involved.
