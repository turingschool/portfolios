### Mission

I struggled a little bit at the beginning of this module because it was such a shift in material from module one. I worked hard to adjust my studying strategies, and meeting with my mentor to just talk about the concepts we were learning helped a lot. My mission this module was to use my creative side more and take more risks in trying to implement ideas not directly covered in class. For the Rails mini-project, I definitely tried new things and learned a lot about ActiveRecord. I also got really creative with the front-end design of our Little Shop by hand-drawing the models for our products (well, that was Steve's idea, but I drew them!) and choosing a cool font and background so our site would look very clean. I'm very happy about my progress this module, and am ready for module three!

### Projects

Below is a list of all of my group projects and assessment scores.

#### Traffic Spy

TrafficSpy is an application that works similar to Google Analytics, tracking data for registered applications. The data from this applications is sent to our server using the `curl` command from the terminal. The user can then view analytical data for a registered application via our website.

#### Rails Mini Project - Fantasy Fighters

A Rails app which allows competitive martial arts dojos to register for the Fight of DEATH. Once registered, the dojo can invite/register their combatants, specifying their martial skills in strength, intelligence and dexterity. The Fight of DEATH is ruled over by a combat federation who can invite combatants from competing dojos to face one another. Winners and losers both have their stats update as they gain experience (or injuries) from combat.

Pair: Aaron Greenspan

#### Little Shop

A shop called Private Stache that sells fake mustaches (and the occasional rare real one for a high price). Admins can create staches with a name, price, description, and assign categories to them. The homepage is an index of the categories. Login is required to checkout. Front-end design is clean and simple.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Matt Pindell: "Matt was my official buddy in 1511. I've never seen someone so excited to start learning to code. Matt is incredibly enthusiastic and determined, and is a great addition to the Turing community. Whenever I would check in with him he would always inquire about what I was learning and how I was doing. He is so thoughtful, which makes him a great collaborator. I have no doubt he will succeed at Turing and beyond!"

Toni Rib: "I was very excited to finally pair with Toni on a project, because I always learn a lot from her when I work with her. It was great to have her by my side as we battled through our first migrations and ActiveRecord associations. Though is was challenging and confusing, we learned a lot together. The only feedback I have for her is to consider the ideas of her group members more often, I wish she had been more trusting of my ideas on how to set up the database and views."

Steve Pentler: "Steve is so easy-going and fun to work with. He is extremely good at front-end design and displaying content in an organized and aesthetic way. He always recognizes whenever I can't reach something in the kitchen and gets it for me without asking, he is an awesome member of the Turing community."

Aaron Greenspan: "Aaron is a lot of fun to pair with. He thinks of really interesting ways to implement features, and it was great to bounce ideas off of each other while working on a project. He can be stubborn when he gets an idea for how to do something, but I never felt he was taking over the project. I am so impressed/slightly intimidated by the fact that he took so much of his time to run the computability theory/machine learning club this module. Every time I talk to him he would tell me about a side project that he was working on, and I always learn something from him."

Dan Winter: "Dan is great to pair with because he is very enthusiastic about project ideas. He thinks of ideas outside the scope of the project and works hard to implement them. I am constantly impressed by the amount of time he puts into exploring things outside of class. Sometimes he got so excited about new ideas that he lost focus on the current feature we were working on, but he told me he was working on this, and as the project went on, he became much more focused."

Steve Olson: "Steve is the calmest programmer known to man. Pairing with him is awesome because he never gets stressed out or phased by a code issue. He is methodical when writing code. He also has an excellent eye for design. He is really, really good at Settlers."

Lenny Meyerson: "Lenny's critical thinking skills are incredible. He is meticulous when he is thinking about how to implement a feature and thinks about areas where security issues or possible errors might arise when implementing a feature a certain way. I have no doubt in time Lenny will be a great developer. Lenny is a pleasure to pair with because he is funny and easy-going."

Alon Waisman: "Alon helped me out during technical interview prep, he taught me some really cool things about ruby. I’ve had some really interesting conversations with him too, he is a fantastic addition to the Turing community."

Jordan Lawler: "Jordan is very slow when playing settlers, it’s almost like he has better things to do like learn how to code."

### Being a Community Member

"I was absurdly fortunate when I was assigned Beth Secor as my Buddy / peer mentor. She, without a doubt, has transformed my experience at Turing for the better. As a Buddy to a new student, it'd be easy to write a blank check for engagement and tell your peer to "reach out at anytime" - putting the onus on them, and focusing on your own mounting list of assignments. Time and time again, Beth has gone above and beyond by reaching out to me at vital junctures and providing invaluable support - knowing I'd need assistance, often before I had realized the dire straits I was in. In short: I appreciate her beyond words." - Matt Pindell

"Beth was a great partner for Traffic Spy. She's a very talented programmer who doesn't mind doing some of the dirty work (like doing 8 migrations in one day!) but is also a very proficient problem solver. When I got stressed on due to an issue on Sunday afternoon before the project was due and had to step away for 30 minutes, Beth stepped in to try to solve the problem without complaint. She's correct in her assessment that I should have listened to her more because her ideas are usually right and I think we sometimes detoured down the wrong path because I pushed too hard for my idea. Overall, I think she did an amazing job for our group and she's always level headed when it comes to handling strong-willed personalities." - Toni Rib

"During Traffic Spy, Beth was trailblazing topics that hadn’t been covered extensively, then happily taking the time to explain. She’s meticulous about the details, so don’t blaspheme about statistics in her presence. She’s fantastic to work with and has a smile on her face the majority of the day. I’m just a little upset she hasn’t had a tea party with me in a while." - Steve Pentler

"What is there to say, really?  I think Beth is the only person in our cohort who — with not a moments’ hesitation — will jump on board with some crazy idea of mine and then spin it off into something far more crazy while laughing the whole time.  She also happens to straight up knows her Rails technologies backwards and forwards, and isn’t afraid to google her way into even more knowledge at an alarming rate.  In terms of critique or criticism, I have legitimately no feedback for Beth, at least when it comes to our pairing together.  The only thing I can say otherwise is that I’d really like to see her engage more in the community at large… and that goes both academically (she knows so much! she’s hoarding it to herself!) and socially." - Aaron Greenspan

"What a project manager! Beth was on it from the beginning and ensured we maintained proper Github workflow, kept up on our waffles and didn’t let anything sneak through the cracks. She helped keep the team focused when dreams of a Stache filled world drew us off task. Beth’s programming skills and analytical mind were a huge asset to the team and she easily caught bugs that made it past our tests." - Dan Winter

"Feedback for Madam Project Manager: It has been a privilege to pair with Beth on little shop. She is excited to try new things and tenacious in working out solutions. Beth is also remarkably patient and willing to take time to explain the problem in question or her admirable solution to it. I have enjoyed getting to learn from and along side her. Her enthusiasm has made this project a pleasure and I look forward to working with her again in the future." - Lenny Meyerson

"Working with Beth on the big Little Shop project has been great. She’s talented in all aspects of the project, from design and front end, to database and logic. Being in the position of team leader, she’s kept us all on task and focused on making progress, and makes sure that things are done right. I hope to be paired with her again at Turing." - Steve Olson

"Feedback for Beth (aka. Just the Worst):  Beth is the drive that keeps me pushing to better myself.  The thought of a meany like her outperforming me in the professional world is simply not an option. also that didnt make sense. ignore that. it never happened. IT WAS ALL A DREAM. /giphy dream" - Jordan Lawler
