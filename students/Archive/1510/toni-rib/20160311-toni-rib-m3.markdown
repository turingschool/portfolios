# Toni Rib - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I would like to get comfortable getting data from APIs both through ruby gems in Rails and through AJAX requests. I've done some AJAX requests with jQuery but they took me hours to set up and I mostly had no idea what I was doing. I would like to challenge myself in my personal project to use multiple APIs to analyze data and display it in interesting ways (namely using the d3js library or another charting library). I'd like to get comfortable with oauth2 since it is used all over the place in web apps. I have no idea how to set up my own API so I'd like to do that at least once during the module. As a totally non-module 3 related goal, I want to get comfortable using Vim by the end of the module and have it customized to my needs (like having a better status bar). I'd also like to have my resume ready to go so I am ready to apply for jobs.

Project to practice exposing APIs and using ActiveRecord to generate business logic using the Sales Engine data.

##### Notes

Really solid project. Probably the best testing I've seen on a Rails Engine project. Understands core concepts of the module at an early stage.

##### Scores

* Completion: 4 - Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* Test-Driven-Development: 4+ - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* Code-Quality: 4 - Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* Api-Design: 4 - Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* Queries: 4 - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### runHacker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ToniRib/run_hacker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)
* [Live Heroku Version](https://run-hacker.herokuapp.com/)

runHacker is my personal project which allows users of MapMyFitness to import data from all their runs, along with addiitonal data pulled from other APIs to be able to plot workouts by many different variables to determine if any trends exist. I used MapMyFitness, Weathersource, Google Maps, Google Elevation, Google Timezone, and Google Geocoder to get all of the information. In addition, I implemented background workers, my own API endpoint, used jQuery and javascript to create dynamic charts with HighCharts, used Presenter and Decorator objects, and overall learned a TON about building out an entire Rails project by myself from scratch.

## Team Projects

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jwperry/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)
* [Live Heroku Version](https://freelancer-for-you.herokuapp.com/)

This project was pivoted from the Little Shop project RoughSketch from Brenna Martenson, Taylor Moore, and Toni Rib. We took a site that sold art and created a site in which job listers could post jobs they wanted completed and contractors could bid to win the job. Some of the challenges were introducing APIs (LinkedIn and GoogleMaps), dealing with timezones, creating a Heroku Scheduler to automatically set jobs from bidding open to bidding closed, and learning to use Presenter objects to move logic out of our views.

##### Notes

__Technical Notes__

* controllers: skinny controllers, logic is properly pushed down the stack and operations are extracted out to private methods when necessary
* tests: very good tests :thumbsup: --- would need more model unit tests.
* models: nice, clean models, good use of the Presenter pattern
* views: presenter pattern :ok_hand:

__Client Notes__

* Really solid product.
* Added maps, optional OAuth login, Emails, and a scheduler

##### Scores

__Client Scores__

* Completion: 3 - Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization: 4-  Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* Extensions: 4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

__Technical Scores__

* Test-Driven Development: 3 - very good feature tests and helper methods in the test_helper, needs more model unit tests
* Code Quality: 4
* Git Workflow: 4 - from Josh Mejia

## Community

### Posse Challenges

[Hopper Posse Repo](https://github.com/ToniRib/posse_challenges)

We completed 4 out of the 5 posse challenges.

### Giving Feedback

* To Dan Winter: Dan is very good at solving problems and has no problem going off on his own and using documentation to figure out a solution. I was really impressed that he got OAuth2 set up with LinkedIn basically by himself at the end of the project. I always felt comfortable when Dan took on a task because I knew he would work hard to complete it and was never worried about whether or not his code would be good. I think Dan is a valuable team member and then only thing he probably needs to improve on is his CSS skills.

* To Joseph Perry: JP is a valuable team member because he never turns down the opportunity to take on a new problem and always asks for help if he gets stuck. He was the leader of our Pivot project and he did a great job with checking in with the group often to see what we were working on. He is extremely good at describing where he is stuck and what he has tried, which I think is a valuable trait for a developer.

### Being a Community Member

* From Marina Corona (Tuesdays w/Toni): "The two times I’ve paired with Toni, I have been thoroughly impressed with her ability to look at someone else’s code, understand it and give clear and concise feedback.  With our Black Thursday project, she was able to draw out the overall project and help us with our understanding of the overall architecture.  Without giving us the answer, she gave us some great ideas on how to pair.  I’m incredibly impressed with her ability to give to the Turing community through tutoring, while managing her large projects and am very grateful to have her a part of our school."

* From Dan Winter (The Pivot): "My favorite part of working with Toni is that she made me a better coder. She took pull requests and github workflow seriously and offered great critical feedback that pushed me to think more in depth about my design decisions and the reasons behind them. She was also always willing to help tackle a bug, talk through complex problems and teach us how to CSS. Thanks Toni!"

* From Sal Espinoza (Tuesdays w/Toni): " I managed to snag a pairing session with Toni during the week that our final project was assigned, and our meeting was especially helpful as my partner and I worked to determine the way forward. Toni’s content knowledge was strong, and she was able to pick up quickly and make meaningful comments. That said, one of the best parts of working with Toni was the time she took at the beginning of the session to get to know me and my background and to give me that same opportunity. It just set the session off on a good foot, and helped make me feel comfortable. She also juggled questions from both my partner and I, and managed to keep everything moving."

* From Joseph Perry (The Pivot): "Having had the opportunity to work with Toni on the Pivot project this module, I can safely say that I am most impressed with Toni's attitude and conduct in a team environment. Toni is a stellar developer - further confirming this came as no surprise to me. Toni's technical prowess is well-documented. However, at no point did she make me feel as though my opinion was unwanted. Toni made an exceptional effort to make sure that all decisions were group decisions, and was very careful to make sure that the project was a great learning experience for our entire group. I can safely say that I learned a lot working with her, that I had a great time working with her, and that I can only hope to have the opportunity to do so again in the future."

### Playing a Part

* Continued 'Tuesdays with Toni' to pair with two students every Tuesday for the entire module.
* Wrote a [blog post](http://tonirib.github.io/personal-blog/jekyll/update/2016/02/15/rails-application-template.html) for the Turing email about Rails Application Templates and taught a student led session on it in addition to my lightning talk.
* Made coffee a few times a week
* Went to the deRailed meetup over the last intermission
* 1603 prework guide for Brian Sayler
* Went to the Denver rb meetup on Tuesday
