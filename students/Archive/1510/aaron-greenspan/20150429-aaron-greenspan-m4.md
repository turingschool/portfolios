# Aaron Greenspan - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Take the foundations I've learned from Ruby and extend them to new languages: Javascript + Elixir.  Focus more on code quality. Gain an understanding of the kind of place I'd like to work, when, and where.

### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 4.  

#### GameTime

**Hand rendered 3D engine and original space flight sim.

* Assessor: Meeka
* Github: https://github.com/afg419/battlezone    

Notes:
* Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors
Instructor Feedback
* The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**Scores** 175/150

#### Scale Up

**Phoenix API implements ReactJS websockets** Implemented a parallel process for auto-incrementing a counter on the back-end and communicated those updates via websockets to users.  Users can manipulate counter.  This project would later iterate into a word descrambling game.

Assessor: Meeka
* GitHub: https://github.com/afg419/word_scram

Notes:

* Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.
* Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
*  Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

**Score** 150/150

#### Real Time

**Master websockets for group communication** This project continued the previous by building out a fully formed word descrambling game on the Phoenix/ReactJS groundwork of Scale Up.  Users get authorized on the back-end, and can join an alternating in-game/out-of-game cycle.  While in-game, an identical collection of randomly generated letters is sent to all players, where they race to form the largest number of words.

Assessor: Meeka
* GitHub: https://github.com/afg419/frozen-citadel-14380
* Production Link: frozen-citadel-14380.herokuapp.com

Notes:  

* Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version.
* All planned features were delivered.
* Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.
* Your application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components.
* The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.
* The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use.
* The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Giving Feedback

>**Jordan Lawler:**

>"Jordan has the most creative mind I’ve seen at Turing.  His ideas are unique, boundary pushing, and shockingly marketable. They've often forced me to consider technology and my relation to it in new ways.  Multiple times this module Jordan has set out to make something far more ambitious than any project spec would dare ask a Turing student.  If his code quality has suffered at times, it's because of the sheer size of the vision he wants to create.  He would benefit from practicing code which does one thing extremely well before adding a new feature, and he'll finally have the luxury of time to do so.  As is, he is leaving with one of the wildest and least-reproducible portfolios of our cohort and the school at large."

>**Karina Gonzalez:**

>"I’ve paired a number of times with Karina on her past two projects.  She’s equal parts curious, excited, and (highly) capable.  She also brings a light-heartedness to her work which makes it a blast to code with her and easy to code well.  I have never once heard Karina ask for clarification on a concept, plan, or code implementation.  This is certainly a testament to her uncanny ability to grasp a thing quickly.  But, I also wonder if Karina is hesitant to ask a big question and admit that something just isn’t making sense.  If I’m right on this, I hope Karina comes to realize that those questions don’t at all make her appear any less competent, but instead achieve the opposite. Such questions will both speed her own progress and, most importantly, allow her colleagues to more readily benefit from her unique thought process and viewpoint."

>**Brant Wellman**

>"I’m going 4 mods deep on Brant feedback here.  Let’s recap the main points from the previous three: I like Brant; Brant should trust in his abilities more; Brant is really supportive of others in our cohort.  New stuff: I like Brant more; Brant is more trusting in his abilities; Brant’s become a total pit of dark and brutal disregard for the feelings of others and has led to ashen tears of countless coding colleagues.  Just kidding.  He knows the respect and care I have for him, and here is not the place to put it."

### Being a Community Member

>"Aaron hates to hear me ask for personal growth from myself or others...but I have seen an amazing amount of personal growth from him. He genuinely listens to feedback and makes real change. His desire for growth is remarkable. As for coding...well, he's good. He knows he's good. But that doesn't matter, because he is more interested in applying his skills in ways that continue to push his envelope. He isn't interested in completing something that he thinks is half-assed. I love talking with him about a project or idea, because he continues to dream the project bigger and bigger until it seems like something that is unattainable. But then he goes out and kills it. It is truly inspirational. He's also an ok human being who has been my rock throughout Turing, and I'm eternally grateful for that."-**Brant Wellman**

>"Aaron is rad. He may be the raddest person ever, surely the raddest in Turing history. While us mere mortals were trying to complete our homework assignments, he was building neural networks and learning new languages. Even though he intensifies my imposter syndrome and has clearly hoarded more than his fair share of brain matter, I am so glad for his presence in my life and my time at Turing. On more than one occasion he bailed me out of some sort of codetastrophe and got me back to having a working app. I hope we remain friends for years to come and I seriously can’t wait to see what crazy thing he builds next."-**Penney Gadget**

>"Aaron Greenspan. What can we say about Aaron Greenspan? Visionary? Maybe. A great dancer? Absolutely. A face chiseled by the gods? By god why not! But why I have gathered you today is to talk about Aarons ability to drive his peers towards their passions, towards finding the better coder within them, and all the while doing it in a supportive,  maternal-like fashion that is truly a pleasure to be apart of.  Greenspan-the-man (patent pending on the name) should be ushered to the echelons of a team where he can undoubtedly deliver an amazing product and make the people who made it more amazing in the process. Did I mention A-a-rons dance moves? We are actually going clubbing next week. Not a big deal."-**Jordan Lawler**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Gave DenverRB beginner track talk.
* Co-led Armstrong Elixir/phoenix posse.
* Helped Module 1 and 3 students with their project.
