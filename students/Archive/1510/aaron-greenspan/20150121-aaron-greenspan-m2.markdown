## Individual

### Your Mission

My goal this module was to make a much larger impact on the community, while also
gaining the understanding to make web apps.

### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 2.

#### Little Shop: Hire My Tribe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevepentler/Hire-My-Tribe)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

**Website for contractors to make a match with freelance web developers** Required to build out
a basic e-commerce type app.  Our group expanded on the base expectations by building
an multi-type user platform with admin functionality.

Assessed By: Rachel

##### Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
* Views: 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
* Controllers: 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
* Models: 3.5: Models show satisfactory organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
* Testing: 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
* Usability: 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
Workflow: 3.5

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/afg419/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

**Webapp for performing web analytics** Required to build a Sinatra app which could automatically
accept and parse javascript generated click-through rate statistics from registered websites.  
The TrafficSpy app would also perform analytics and render them for easy comprehension.

Team: Penney & Aaron & Taylor

Assessed By: Mike Dao

##### Notes:

* 79 tests, 190 assertions, all passing.
* Good use of helper methods in tests.
* 99.54% Test Coverage.
* Used Materialize.
* Try to lighten up on use of instance variables in controller.
* Some minor refactoring possible with pulling things out of controller or refactoring to pull   out code to methods.

##### Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric: 1. Functional Expectations

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Hector Huertas:** You have STRONG opinions about how code ought to be written, both on the screen and as a team.  This has been incredibly valuable in our group, and indeed is one of the things I look forward to most when working with you;  At the end of the day your ideas always have merit and are backed by a mountain of good reasoning.  As a result, you almost always force me to reconsider and dive in deeper to a concept I may have written off as ‘trivial’ or ‘uninteresting’ prematurely.  I will say, however, that you could definitely sugarcoat your ideas a bit more… Though I can (usually) take a comment like “No man that is absolutely wrong” in stride, I am sure others may be left reeling.  (For the record, I personally love it and usually start to grin when I know it’s going to get heated when you say something like that…)  Just be careful moving forward!

>**Joseph Perry:** It’s been an absolute blast working with you on Little Shop.  You are perhaps the most level headed guy I’ve yet worked with, and are also perhaps the most in tune with where our group is at an where it needs to go.  I especially appreciate the care you take in asserting your opinions, and the careful clarity you provide about what you want and think is best.  Pressed to give negative feedback, I think you should be more willing to strike out on your own earlier on in a project… Your work these past few days building out new functionality and styling is of the highest quality in my mind, and you are definitely doing some of your best work on your own.

>**Beth Secor:** What is there to say, really?  I think Beth is the only person in our cohort who — with not a moments’ hesitation — will jump on board with some crazy idea of mine and then spin it off into something far more crazy while laughing the whole time.  She also happens to straight up knows her Rails technologies backwards and forwards, and isn’t afraid to google her way into even more knowledge at an alarming rate.  In terms of critique or criticism, I have legitimately no feedback for Beth, at least when it comes to our pairing together.  The only thing I can say otherwise is that I’d really like to see her engage more in the community at large… and that goes both academically (she knows so much! she’s hoarding it to herself!) and socially.

### Being a Community Member

>"Aaron and I chose to pair on the ruby project, Event Manager, over the winter break. Working with Aaron was a pleasure. He has a high energy level and is enthusiastic about things, even when he isn't necessarily excited about doing them. Aaron kept me engaged throughout the hours that we paired together and was fun to work with. Last module I gave Aaron specific feedback that at times his confidence can come off as intimidating to others. I have not witnessed that happen during this module, and I believe that Aaron's awareness around this has translated into personal growth."-**Brant Wellman**

>"I loved working with Aaron on Traffic Spy. He took on the role of project lead because he wanted to practice letting go of his inclination to take over and code everything, especially when stressed. This worked well with my desire to be allowed the time and space to puzzle through difficult things without feeling like I was holding my team back. Aaron excelled at making the whole team feel supported, respected, and equal. I really value the times I’ve gotten to work with Aaron and have learned so much from him.  It clear that he is already an incredible developer and team player."-**Penney Garrett**

>"Aaron was our team leader for TrafficSpy.  I quickly realized Aaron would be my perfect boss. He's a great listener and considers every suggestion. When he disagrees with a suggestion he will calmly explain his reason and why his way was more agile for our website. Aaron can get overly stressed, but once given a few minutes, he will jump back into his normal self. I found working with Aaron taught me a lot about programming. He constantly brought challenges to the group to complete. I’m excited to see what Aaron creates next!!"-**Taylor Moore**

>"I am basically a huge fan-girl of Aaron's: I have sat in on his computability theory club meetings and his student-led session on the halting problem. It is clear that Aaron has a love for mathematics, and his enthusiasm is contagious. I think his greatest strength is his ability to translate mathematical constructs into language that is more accessible to Turing students, i.e. Ruby programs. I would like to see him help students become more comfortable with taking math problems and translating them into Ruby or some other programming language... and this may involve some "curriculum development" where he breaks a problem, e.g. linear regression, into several iterations as we would see in a module project. The challenge for him would then be figuring out how to balance the time between his own learning and facilitating the learning of others."-**Erinna Chen**


### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Gave a lightning talk on the difficulties in measuring coastline length.
* Gave a student led session on the halting problem.
* Started the Computability/MachineLearning club, and have presented at the club every week of the module.
* Have assisted multiple students with their project work/assessment prep throughout the module.
* Organized and participated in Kay Posse events.
