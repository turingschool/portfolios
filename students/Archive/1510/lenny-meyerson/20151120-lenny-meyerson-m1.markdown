# Lenny Meyerson - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
I came to Turing to learn in an immersive environment- to offer single-minded focus to this study for the next seven months. Thus far, the process has been more challenging than I expected but in ways I did not anticipate. Having imagined that my time at Turing would be about learning to program(typing code), I believe I focused to narrowly on this subject at the expense of time that might have been spent learning problem solving skills, learning how to learn in this environment, and learning how and when to both ask for and make use of help.

As I continue in the program these neglected aspects must play a larger role in my studies.

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 1.

#### (Solo Projects)

#### Enigma

Assessed By: Horace

* [Github URL:](https://github.com/TheObtuseAutodidact/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Encryption/decryption machine. Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Comments:

Base functionality is all there and seems solid
28 tests; seem to be spread across various objects; probably could use a few more, but overall volume is ok
Lots of opportunities remain to use some more sophisticated enumerables
Watch especially for the map pattern (make empty array, then iteratively push onto the array)
In general we can trim a lot of the methods by relying on enumerables to generate new values rather than having to reassign variables at each step
Some of the methods are getting long and could use some extraction
Watch out for "magic numbers" hanging out -- would like to keep putting semantic names on these
Scores:

Overall Functionality 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
TDD 3
Breaking Logic Into Components 3
Enumerable & Collections 3

#### Jungle Beats
A drum machine that's backed by a linked list.
Assessed By: Mike

* [Github URL:](https://github.com/theobtuseautodidact/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Notes:

23 runs in tests
need separate file for node test
pop does not work
cannot work with strings, just individual data items
overall clean code, good tail method
some opportunities for refactoring, there are some long methods
Scores:

Overall Functionality: 1
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Test Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Looping and Recursion: 3

#### (Team Projects)


#### Headcount
Group Lenny & Brant

Assessed By: Jeff

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brantwellman/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/a0ccb625762f2ead4d0bcf554c88daeda1784eea/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Real-world data collection and analysis. Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

Notes

Spec harness: pass iterations 0, 1
Your tests: 105 all passing
Testing looks good, try to strip down the data to just what you need, look for opportunities for just a bit of extraction/reuse
Implementation looks clean, did some good refactoring
Solid foundation to keep building
Deliver code that passes the spec harness for I3 on Tuesday
Scores

#### Functional Expectations

2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

#### Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
#### Code Sanitation

4: Zero complaints


### http: yeah_you_know_me
Group: Lenny & Alex

Assessed By: Horace

* [GitHub URL:](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Orignal Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Building a functioning web server and putting that understanding into action.



Notes:

Some initial progress on a procedural solution the problem
Struggled to make layered progress on problem components, largely due to difficulties in applying dev processes and techniques
Struggled with outpacing feedback - no tests to provide feedback, seems to have led to difficulty understanding the progress that had been made thus far and the scope of the problem
Scores:

#### Overall Functionality   

* 1: Application implements two or fewer iterations

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines)
and needs significant refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

#### Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### Giving Feedback

It was a pleasure to work with Brant. Brant kept me on track for a project that felt overwhelming. His ability to focus on the next component of the whole that needs attention served as a great lesson. If I were to offer on criticism to Brant, it would be about recognizing the point of diminishing returns. Brant pushes with an admirable tenacity. This often leads him to push well past the point where the effort in is reasonably productive. While this drive is admirable, it may not offer the greatest return on investment. That said, working with Brant pushed me out of my comfort zone and I learned a lot from the experience.

 Alex brought excitement and enthusiasm to our project. As I stared at our assignment and felt a sinking feeling at my ability to comprehend the task at hand, Alex was sure we’d get there. When I got lost in the project and I could figure out how to escape the hole I had for myself, Alex was there cheering me on. Despite the late refocus on the project and the accompanying failing grade, the progress that was made was significantly the result of Alex’s infectious enthusiasm. To offer one point of criticism, I would suggest that if Alex learns to channel his enthusiasm toward the next most immediate task at hand he will grow into a formidable developer. I look forward to watching that growth happen.

 Penney’s presence in the class was, at least initially for me, an odd combination of nerve-racking, and calming. It made me nervous insofar as here was an example that not everyone makes it through the module the first time through. But it was also reassuring to have close access to someone who new the lay of the land. As the class began, Penney seemed about as uncertain as any of us but it was a real joy to see her grow more comfortable and confident in both her new cohort and with the material being presented. Being the person repeating the module within our group gave Penney’s journey center stage. Getting to share her growth and victory felt inspiring.  I hope she can carry her seemingly new found confidence as she continues here journey into uncharted territory.

### Being a Community Member

Brant:
Lenny has a highly analytical mind and approach to his work, and working with him for this project has been valuable to me, as I’ve learned to look at problems from a different perspective. Something that Lenny should try to be aware of is a tendency to be too hard on himself, which can cause him to spiral into a place of unfocus and non-productivity. Lenny needs to be confident in his skills and what he brings to a pairing partnership. In the long run this will reward himself and his future pairing partners.

Penney:
I have thoroughly enjoyed being in class with Lenny. The questions and comments he shares in class are really helpful and enlightening - I love the way he breaks apart the logic with things and rephrases them in ways that are more accessible and understandable for the newbie programmer. I know this module has been difficult for him, but his dedication and drive are apparent and inspiring and I genuinely can’t wait to continue this journey alongside him.

### Playing a Part

As something of a socially awkward introvert, I have tried to be part of the community in little way.
I've appreciated Fridays' lunch roulette as an opportunity to get to know school mates both inside and outside of my cohort.
I've met with Justin Pease on most Friday mornings for help and perspective from a senior student.
I've also tried to make little efforts, as a resident of the space, such as not leaving a tp or paper towel rolls empty- generally trying to be a good roommate.
