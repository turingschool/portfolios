### Giving Feedback

For Beth Secor (Little Shop):
It has been a privilege to pair with Beth on little shop. She is excited to try new things and tenacious in working out solutions. Beth is also remarkably patient and willing to take time to explain the problem in question or her admirable solution to it. I have enjoyed getting to learn from and along side her. Her enthusiasm has made this project a pleasure and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

For Beth Sebian (Rails mini project):
The Rails mini project was quite short but Beth’s idea that as a short, non-graded project, our focus should be on learning rather than end product was exactly what I would have wished for. She approached the process as one to be untangled rather than a race to the finish line. I could not have asked for a better use of my study time.  Writing, reviewing, and discussing code was done with a determined calm that made the project feel like an enjoyable series of study sessions. I would enjoy working with Beth again in the future. "

For Toni Rib (Rails mini project)
When I was grouped with Toni for the Rails mini project I was intimidated. She is smart, quick, and her work seem exemplary. She was, however, quick to relieve me of my intimidation and worry. She was always quite happy to explain her understanding of a problem or her solution to it. She showed no ego whatsoever about saying “I don’t know” when appropriate and she seemed eager for the group to be successful. I greatly appreciated her help and insight and I look forward to working with her again.

For James Crockett (Traffic Spy)
Working with Jamie on Traffic Spy was an excellent experience. He was keen, insightful, and eager to work. I greatly appreciated his patience in explaining aspects of Sinatra or our code as the project increased in size and complexity. Perhaps most of all I was struck by how much Jamie seemed to genuinely enjoy the project process. Nothing seemed to cause significant stress to him and his easy enjoyment was contagious.  Traffic Spy was the lowest stress experience on a Turing project I had yet had and that is owed in large part to working with Jamie. I look forward to working with him again.

For Matt Hecker
"Since module 1, Matt has been a terrific source of help when I find myself in over my head. He’s been consistently patient in explaining concepts with which I’ve struggled and has seemed genuinely invested in my understanding the concept(s) in question. I have felt privileged to count Matt as part of my support network at Turing and I lament his departure for entirely selfish reasons. Matt has paused what he was doing every single time I asked him for help and when I’ve asked for lengthier pairing time he has simply asked when.  I have no doubt that success awaits him as a professional developer. Any team on which he finds himself will be lucky to have him. "

### Being a Community Member
Beth Secor (Little Shop):
"Lenny's critical thinking skills are incredible. He is meticulous when he is thinking about how to implement a feature and thinks about areas where security issues or possible errors might arise when implementing a feature a certain way. I have no doubt in time Lenny will be a great developer. Lenny is a pleasure to pair with because he is funny and easy-going."

Toni Rib (Rails mini project):
"Lenny seems to always default to saying he has no idea what is going on, but I think he just needs to learn to trust himself more. I paired with him and Beth S on the rails mini-project and while we were switching who solved the error each time a new one came up, Lenny often knew where and how to fix the error he happened to get. I really think if he put some more confidence into his programming abilities that he surprise himself sometimes. Overall he is a great group member who communicates well and isn't afraid to ask for help when he needs it."

 Beth Sebian(Rails mini project):
 "Lenny is a too-modest classmate and teammate. His modesty is largely a strength -- it speaks to high standards, a commitment to doing good work, an interest in contributing to those around him. And it also speaks to his kindness and humility interacting with peers. I especially enjoyed working on a project with Lenny because of his focus on learning concepts and prioritizing comprehension over extensions. We agreed early into the project that that was our goal and stuck to that mission throughout our work. There are ways in which his humility holds the people around Lenny back, though, and I'd like to challenge him to look for more opportunities to serve his peers. I'm always grateful to the classmate that asks questions, insists on pausing until something is understood, and equips him/herself to teach those concepts forward. I think Lenny could be of great service to his peers here and after Turing if he specializes in the art of seeking seeking knowledge; instead of being timid, he should pursue his learning with confidence in service of his own education and those around him. He's in larger company than he gives himself credit for."

James Crockett(Traffic Spy):
Pairing with Lenny I quickly learned that if Lenny is stuck on a piece of logic, we usually got it wrong. I can't count the times Lenny would ask Greg or I to explain why we were doing XYZ, only to reply "You're right, we can't do that" or "You're right, that won't work." He is a wizard with words and I admire his ability to articulate a thought, concept, or question masterfully. His sense of humor is infectious and that makes him easy and fun to work with. My suggestion to Lenny would be to not get overwhelmed at the possibility of not understanding something immediately. He should have more confidence in his reasoning ability because, as I learned, he's usually ultimately right.

Matt Hecker:
Lenny is both bright and humble. We paired for a bit on his headcount project and talked at length about the merits of staying behind for a module, and programming in general. I enjoy his enthusiasm for ideas just for the sake of ideas and found it refreshing to talk to him. Because of his humility and nature he is infinitely approachable. He relates any topic to ideas and contrasting viewpoints and so often causes conversations to elevate and turn more lofty even during  “water cooler” talk and it seems completely natural and not forced. I actually have no idea how he does this. I always end up enjoying where things go when he enters group  conversations at the lunch table. I also appreciate the fact that he seems to always be here working the extra hours needed to get a project done, even though Im not in his cohort and have never worked on project  long term with him.


### Playing a Part

As something of a socially awkward introvert, I have tried to be part of the community in little way.
I've appreciated Fridays' lunch roulette as an opportunity to get to know school mates both inside and outside of my cohort.
I've also tried to make little efforts, as a resident of the space, such as not leaving a tp or paper towel rolls empty- generally trying to be a good roommate.
