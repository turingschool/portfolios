### Your Mission

In repeating module 1, I set out to build a stronger understanding and foundation of Ruby and object oriented programming. At the end of the last module I felt like Swiss cheese - full of holes in my ability to build anything on my own and still completely mystified by the overall model. My goal was to fill in those holes and build confidence in my abilities, and I absolutely feel that I have accomplished that. There are many things I still want to understand better and feel more capable with, but now I feel I have the foundation to do that. It's amazing to finally have some forward momentum after weeks of spinning my wheels and feeling left behind.

Enigma uses Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed by: Jeff Casimir

Notes:
* 45 tests, all pass
* Watch out for relying on the current date in tests
* Good tests on the Encrypt side, also Decrypt
* Implementation code is clean and easy to understand
* Overall really good

Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 4

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project involved building a web application capable of:

* Receiving a request from a user
* Comprehending the request's intent and source
* Generating a response
* Sending the response to the user

Assessed by: Horace Williams

Notes:
* Solid functionality through I3
* Starting on a good attempt toward class extraction and refactoring, but the extraction is not totally complete so we end up with duplicated responsibilities between various classes
* More diagramming / sketching / dependency tracking / state examination (what classes rely on each other; what instance variables are being tracked in each object)
* Testing is pretty lacking -- might have been helpful to focus on stripping down overall functionality into cleaner inputs/outputs that could be tested more granularly
* Kudos being alone for the project and struggling through the many unknowns


Scores:
* Overall Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## Team

##### Collaborative projects:

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/headcount_2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This project analyzes CSV datasets for schools in Colorado.

Assessed by: Andrew Carmer

Notes:
* A little complicated at times, but over all functional. Some ruby style and api issue like using 'return' often. Some variable name issues, but most of the times short variable names could have been considered appropriate. Some long methods that violated SRP but method names were excellent. Some refactoring would have helped overall. Some concern with over complication. Some of the refactoring was really good, like pulling out truncate and we talked about other things they would have wanted to do.

Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test_Drive Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

###### For JP:

Working with JP was fantastic. He is profoundly intelligent, patient, and respectful. I thoroughly enjoyed the way he would walk me through every step of the code when I was confused or we had been apart. I learned so much from him!

###### For Emily:

 Emily is a treasure. It’s rare for me to meet other people who are as willing to wear their heart on their sleeve as I am, so in Emily I feel I’ve found a kindred spirit. Despite struggling during this module, she has kept an unrelentingly positive outlook and continued to push through. I admire and respect that tenacity, and know that it will only make her stronger in the end.  I absolutely consider Emily a friend and look forward to working together in the future.

 ###### For Jordan:

 Jordan is a huge asset to our class. He’s brilliant and is always willing to share his time to help other students puzzle through tough concepts. His enthusiasm is contagious and inspiring, and I really look forward to learning more from him as time goes on!

 ###### For Lenny:
 I have thoroughly enjoyed being in class with Lenny. The questions and comments he shares in class are really helpful and enlightening - I love the way he breaks apart the logic with things and rephrases them in ways that are more accessible and understandable for the newbie programmer. I know this module has been difficult for him, but his dedication and drive are apparent and inspiring and I genuinely can’t wait to continue this journey alongside him.

### Being a Community Member

###### From JP:

Penney is an absolutely fantastic person to work with. She is unrelentingly positive and eager to contribute. She makes excellent use of pairing techniques, and does a great job of following good development and testing practices!

###### From Emily:

While I have not yet had the pleasure of pairing with Penney, she is a joy to be around. Penney is available for advice/help on projects, Turing culture, or just checking in on classmates “emotional temperature”. Many individuals in 1510 frequently voice their excitement that Penney is with us. She is a rockstar as a human and as a coder.

###### From Lenny:

 Penney’s presence in the class was, at least initially for me, an odd combination of nerve-racking, and calming. It made me nervous insofar as here was an example that not everyone makes it through the module the first time through. But it was also reassuring to have close access to someone who new the lay of the land. As the class began, Penney seemed about as uncertain as any of us but it was a real joy to see her grow more comfortable and confident in both her new cohort and with the material being presented. Being the person repeating the module within our group gave Penney’s journey center stage. Getting to share her growth and victory felt inspiring.  I hope she can carry her seemingly new found confidence as she continues here journey into uncharted territory.

###### Feedback from 1508 at the end of last module:

She's so awesome.

Penney was an awesome addition to 1508 and we're all going to miss her. She is extremely dedicated and hard working, and I'm convinced that as soon as she is able to shift her way of thinking into one that is more conducive to programming, she will make a very successful developer.

Hope you kick some 1510 ass next cohort with all of your amazing knowledge and skills.  I know you are going to slay it!  Thanks for always being so honest and open, I definitely appreciated it! :)

Penney, I was so happy to have you in our Module and can't wait to see you totally own Enigma, Chisel, and all those fun little projects next time around!  I don't think we got to spend that much time working together but I just really wanted to say that hearing you talk about your code from week to week and seeing what you guys did on Headcount - it's clear that you know your sh*t and hope you have as much fun with it in a couple of weeks.

I paired with Penney at the start of the module, and worked with her for a bit at the end of the module on Headcount. She's hands down the most improved person in our cohort and I'm incredibly impressed with her because of it.

You know this shit better than a lot of the people moving on. I respect your choice to repeat the module, but what you need to work on is your faith in your own knowledge. You got this girl!

Penney is always so kind and willing to work with people.

Having a woman like you in the group who is sincere and honest, makes it easier for the rest of us to be sincere and honest and comfortable with ourselves. You're awesome Penny!

It's no secret that you struggled this module, but I'm so pleased to see how well you've handled the final week here. From choosing to repeat/being comfortable with not "knowing it all," to just generally being a mature adult and student, I've really enjoyed being in 1508 with you. I'm sad to see that you're not continuing on with us, but I want you to know that you've inspired me and I've really enjoyed working with you. You understand the material and have all the potential to be a strong programmer. My last and major piece of constructive advice is don't psych yourself out and let your fears inhibit you. After your assessment closed up you because doubly focused, more willing to code/experiment on Headcount, and your abilities just shined all the more brightly. Keep that mentality and you will go far here :)

Penney was always fun to hang around. She always had an interesting perspective on things and generally made me think deeper about everything. I enjoy the conversations we get to have together. I just hope we can continue to spend as much time together as we did when we were in Foxtrot together. I'm going to miss Penney so much.

Penney, I'm bummed that I didn't get to know you as well as I would have liked during, module 1.  But word on the street is that you've been climbing at Movement with Horace and I'd love to start joining you guys. Thinking about restarting my membership next module so hopefully we can be climbing buddies and scale some fake rocks together!

I'm really glad that we got to know each other and work together this module. You are an awesome person and I can't wait for us to grow our programming skills. Even if it's not the same class, we're on this journey together.  - Aaron

Penney you're amazing. Your work ethic is very apparent and you don't give yourself enough credit. I can't wait to watch you slay module 1.

Enjoy module 1 the second time around. You'll crush it. Try mentoring the other module 1 students where you can to solidify your skills and boost your confidence.

I really respected Penney's attitude during this module. She gave it her best effort and had the courage to repeat the module to better her skills even though I am sure that was not an easy decision to make.

### Playing a Part

At my core I am a shy person with introvert tendencies, so it's easy for me to want to keep to myself. In my time here at Turing I have been trying to open up to a broader pool of people and just generally become more involved, active, and helpful. It's a process for me, but one that I feel I've made progress with and am dedicated to continuing.

I also continually try to do as many little tasks around the space as I can - unpacking boxes, tidying tables, stocking the bathrooms, doing dishes, etc.
