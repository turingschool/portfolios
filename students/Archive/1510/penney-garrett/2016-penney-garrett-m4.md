# Penney Garrett - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission

I set out this module to learn a new language and have a better understanding of writing
client-side applications. I have really enjoyed writing Javascript and am excited to
continue learning and exploring all that it offers.

### Attendance

Except for several instances where I can personal things to deal with or job interviews, I was present every day.

This is a Rails single-page application that uses JavaScript and jQuery to set up CRUD functionality for creating and storing ideas. It relies heavily on jQuery's AJAX method to make calls to internal API endpoints to retrieve, store, update, and delete data.

"Some wonkiness with the last selenium test that is failing. Be sure to not have failing tests on master in future projects but this one is reasonable. Great README! Great usage of selenium testing! Pretty interface."

Looking For is a job fetching application that searches the world wide web for job postings that might be relevant to a Turing Student's interest, stores them and generates a searchable portal to answer the question: 'Hello Company, is it me you're looking for?'

Our team added features for a V2 deploy, working as a team of developers on one project. We pulled work from the existing Github issues and created new issues for the next team.

### Giving Feedback

For Brant:
I feel personally really fortunate that I got to be in the same class as Brant and have this crazy experience alongside him. He is the rock of 1510 in many ways, the one person I, and many others, know they can always depend upon, whether it be for technical or emotional support. Brant is always willing to lend a patient ear and make time for whatever a friend may need. If I get to work with someone a fraction as wonderful as him out in the real world, I will have won. I hope he realizes, as he sets foot out into the job force, that he is an excellent developer and will be a huge asset to whatever team he ends up working with.

For Beth Sebian:
There aren’t enough words in the dictionary to express how grateful I am to have been able to spend time with Beth working on a project this module. Beyond how much I like and respect her as a friend and colleague, her technical skills are downright incredible. I hope one day to be able to think through tough problems as effectively as she can. In a mere 36 hours Beth took our Game Time project from average to high-level professional, figuring out and implementing the algorithm to have levels auto-generate (something it took the original creator of the game over a week to do). Saying I’m impressed would be an understatement, and I know I am not alone in that sentiment.
But Beth isn’t just an incredible developer. She is an incredible person. The kind of person that has the ability to change the world in very real and meaningful ways. The majority of people at Turing have their hands more-than-full just balancing the course load, but Beth somehow managed on top of that to start the Environment Variables group, run student led sessions and a gear-up, and anchor a posse that is building a full-on app to help people find affordable housing. She is a huge inspiration to me and I truly hope we can continue to work together in our post-Turing lives. Whatever team she ends up working with in her professional life will incredibly lucky to have her.

For Beth Secor:
I have so much respect for Beth. She’s an amazing team member, always willing to lend a hand or an ear or part of her incredible brain. Over the last couple of modules she has regularly made herself available to help me when I was stuck on something, or to simply listen and be supportive when I was feeling blue. I can’t wait to see what she accomplishes after Turing!

For Aaron:
Aaron is rad. He may be the raddest person ever, surely the raddest in Turing history. While us mere mortals were trying to complete our homework assignments, he was building neural networks and learning new languages. Even though he intensifies my imposter syndrome and has clearly hoarded more than his fair share of brain matter, I am so glad for his presence in my life and my time at Turing. On more than one occasion he bailed me out of some sort of codetastrophe and got me back to having a working app. I hope we remain friends for years to come and I seriously can’t wait to see what crazy thing he builds next.

### Being a Community Member

From Beth Sebian:
Penney and I had the chance to work together on GameTime. It was by far my most enjoyable project at Turing, bringing a blend of challenge, creativity, and great teamwork, namely because I had such a great partner. A few things about Penney's work on the project stand out: first, she came to the project with enthusiasm and was intent on being successful. I saw that when she reached out to me before the project was officially launched with an idea for the game we could develop. She maintained this vision throughout the project. Second, she was well organized and purposeful about how she spent her time on the project, and always delivered the features she took responsibility for. I never had to worry that she would not hold up her end of the work. Third, she maintained a clear understanding of how the different parts of our project fit together, anticipated needs ahead of time, and communicated those clearly to me. I remember her spending time during a mid-project work session charting out the coordinates of our grid so that we'd have them well-documented in our app instead of rely on memory. Her attention to details like this made her vital to the work. // Aside from her technical and project management skills, I also know Penney to be an insightful, kind, lovely person -- that was the best part about working with her. I've harped here a bit about her technical capabilities because I don't think she gives herself enough credit for them. If I was managing a software project, I'd want Penney on my team both as an individual contributor, and as someone who would bring out the best in her teammates and elevate the dynamics of our group.

From Brant:
I remember first meeting Penney during Module 1 and immediately being drawn to her sense of calm and wisdom that she brought to the group. I feel very lucky to have been able to watch Penney's growth through the course of the 4 modules that we were together. Her personal struggle with believing in herself has actually been one of the more inspiring things to witness during the last 7 months. There have been clear times that it was obvious that her struggle was real, but Penney owned that struggle, faced it head on and learned what she wanted/needed to learn. Her determination to succeed is something that I hope incorporate in my own life.

From Beth Secor:
Penney and I worked on the same boxtrot dev team for a week. She took on a pretty big undertaking setting up Travis CI for the project, and worked through a lot of setbacks through the way. I love working with Penney because she is so determined and wants to understand every aspect of what she is implementing. She is a great developer, and I can't wait to see what she builds!

### Playing a Part

I continued my participation in the Environment Variables group, helping to launch the schools new recycling program. I also continued to take care of the coffee, delivering it every Sunday. I participated in the Brin posse, which got me back in the habit of doing exercisms regularly, and also unofficially joined the Pahlka posse. I took on the brunt of organizing the graduation dinner for 1510, with help from Greg. Additionally I have had a couple of prospective students reach out to me via email after finding my contact info on the Turing website, and am in conversation with them, answering all their questions.

I am not ready for it yet, but I would love once I get my bearings and some real-world experience to help mentor new students.

## Self Assessment

* End-of-Module Assessment: 3 - I was excused from the assessment
* Individual Work & Projects: 3 - Satisfactory evaluations, clear commitment and growth in my work
* Group Work & Projects: 4 - I feel that I excel at helping my teammates be their best selves and achieve great results
* Community Participation: 3 - I participate in required activities as well as a couple above-and-beyond supports of the community
* Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3 - I feel I help others to be their best selves and am continually trying to improve myself in response to feedback

### Notes

* Felt that M4 tied everything together for me
* Repeating M1 set me up to understand things. This wasn't going to come easily.
* Might have repeated M3 if I could

### Outcome
