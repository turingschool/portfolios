## Your Mission

My goal in module 2 has been to foster a deeper understanding of what building a website really
means. The transformation in my understanding over the last 6 weeks is really amazing.
When the module began I had absolutely no idea what it took to create a usable website. Now I
am finding myself on websites every day thinking about what the developers could have done
better or differently, or how I might build it myself. I am beginning to really comprehend
what is going on behind the scenes at all levels. In some ways this definitely renders the
feeling of "the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know", but it is also
an empowering feeling that makes me excited to continue to learn more and grow in this field.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

###### For Taylor:
I had a great time working with Taylor on Traffic Spy. His enthusiasm and motivation is infectious and, frankly, endearing. He made me feel supported and respected and also kept the whole team laughing all the way through.  I feel like I saw Taylor grow an incredible amount as a developer on this project and I look forward to see where he goes from here!

###### For Aaron:
 I loved working with Aaron on Traffic Spy. He took on the role of project lead because he wanted to practice letting go of his inclination to take over and code everything, especially when stressed. This worked well with my desire to be allowed the time and space to puzzle through difficult things without feeling like I was holding my team back. Aaron excelled at making the whole team feel supported, respected, and equal. I really value the times I’ve gotten to work with Aaron and have learned so much from him.  It clear that he is already an incredible developer and team player.

 ###### For Brant:
 Brant is great to work with. He’s a good communicator, easy and fun to work with, and always willing to help out. I have learned so much from working with him and really look forward to collaborations in the future. Truly I feel I’ve made a friend and ally in Brant, and I can tell that a lot of other people have also. Moving on to module 3, I would caution him to not let stress take over - sometimes he doubts his skills when things get intense, but he knows the material and is masterful at puzzling through tough issues.

 ###### For Jamie:
 I have seriously enjoyed working with Jamie on Little Shop. His ability to think through tough logic and algorithms is really impressive and inspiring - I hope I can one day navigate a web app as well as he does! I have learned a ton and felt really supported along the way. Jamie is patient, kind, and always willing to explain anything his team doesn’t understand. I hope we can work together in the future and I know he has great things on the horizon

 ###### For Jordan:
 Jordan was really fun to work with. He brings an energy and intensity that is infectious and inspiring. The amount of knowledge that he has amassed in this short amount of time is seriously impressive, and I can’t wait to see where it all takes him. I appreciate how willing he is to help others out and explain complex topics, and I hope we get to work together more in the future.


### Being a Community Member

###### From Taylor:
During the time of Traffic Spy, I had the pleasure of having Penney as a partner. Our first DTR, I informed the group of my tendency to skip the error and go back to the code. She was constantly hounding on me to check errors, which developed a habit for me. So I praise her team engagement and team development! One thing Penney could work on is her imposter syndrome. She is a growing developer and is very good at it! She just needs to be more confident in her abilities! I am constantly surprised at Penney’s growth! I can’t wait to see more!

###### From Brant:
Penney is a wonderful person to have on a project. Her positive energy seeps into everything that she works on. She seems to be much more comfortable with her place at Turing and with her skills now that she has moved through Module 2, although there are still times that her confidence lags behind her skills. I encourage Penney to remember that she can do it and __IS DOING IT__! Penney is a programmer!

###### From Aaron:
Penney readily admits that she isn’t the strongest coder.  She is, however, absolutely fearless in her attempt to improve.  In a three person project which is notorious for being extremely difficult, Penney on day one made it clear that she wanted a piece of the hard logic in TrafficSpy.  She was the first of us to connect our app to the command line, the first of us to tackle Active Record in a project setting, and over all trail blazed ahead of the group, sketching an outline that Taylor and I often followed.  She played a far larger role in that project than she might imagine, and her talents in coding, at least in my eyes, greatly exceed the judgement she passes on herself.  My advice to her would be to keep at it: keep throwing yourself in the shit, enjoy it when it’s confusing and overwhelming, and invite others to join you:  When someone else is feeling down on themselves, but lacks the courage to push themselves into scarier waters, that’s where you can be a leader and become an invaluable asset to the school.

###### From Jamie:
Pairing with Penney on Little Shop taught me that she has a genuine curiosity and desire to learn every aspect of a project. She's even interested in learning about the odd errors her partners run into on their own and how those were resolved. I also like that she's eager to bite into and take ownership of large aspects of a project, as she did with authentication and a lot of the admin functionality in Little Shop.  My biggest suggestion for Penney would be to force herself to take breaks if she's stuck on an issue. I get the same tunnel vision, but it's important to not let the road blocks consume you.

###### From Jordan:
Me and Penney worked together for the mini-project, and I could not have asked for a better partner. Penney has an incredibly sharp eye for technical details for someone who is a self-proclaimed ‘not a technology person’. I think my favorite part about working with Penney is that she is assertive with her communication which is incredible.  This leaves no room for question or doubt in what needs to be done or where the team is at.

My one piece of critique for Penney is that sometimes her confidence seems to waiver ever so slightly.  My advice to her stems from the Arthur ( the Aardvark) TV show.  It goes “Believe in yourseeeelf, at least thats the place to STAAAAAAAARRRRTTT! “, she is an incredibly bright and capable programmer, absolutely a tech-person(at least she is now!), and she deserves the confidence that comes along with all her hard work.

### Playing a Part
I admit to being a bit introverted during module 2. I finished module 1 (for the second time) a bit shakier than I had hoped, and because of that have been extremely focused on my own work and study during this last 6 weeks. Module 2 is a firehose of information, and as much as I've wanted to interact with and help my fellow students, I've really needed to focus on my own journey and learning.
That being said, I still try to contribute in as many little ways as I can. I clean up around me, stock the bathrooms, put away dishes. I also have made a stronger commitment this module to keeping a regular and dedicated exercise schedule, and I am continuously encouraging others to join me. Horace and I have definitely become great friends and climbing partners, and we try to include as many other students as we can.

## Review

### Mid module diagnostic

Evaluator: Andrew Carmer

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking:  3 --
Student was able to put most of the pieces together, but did stumble at times and was sometimes confused and not able to put things together.

* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library:  3 --
Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

* Rails Syntax & API:  3 --
Student needed guidance at times. There were a few occasions that the student was not able to remember the rails syntax needed to perform a task. Overall student is in a good place, but it was suggested they continue to work on things and the repetition will help everything sink in.

* Rails Style:  3 --
No major errors with pushing logic down the stack, but there were times that guidance was given to get to the answer.

* Testing:  3 --
Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

* Collaboration:  3 --
Collaboration was decent, but needs work. At times of struggle I would like to see more communication as to what the student was thinking. There was often silence and I had to take the first step in collaboration.
