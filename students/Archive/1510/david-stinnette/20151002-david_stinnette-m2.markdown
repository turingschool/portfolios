# David Stinnette - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to improve my study habits and focus. I made a daily schedule of study times before and after school to stick to each day. I met with mentors, other students and instructors to pick up tips & tricks when solving new problems. Finally I stuck to pomodoros when studying alone to help me stay focused when sitting at my computer. I now feel much more comfortable problem solving the unknown.

### End of Module Assessment
