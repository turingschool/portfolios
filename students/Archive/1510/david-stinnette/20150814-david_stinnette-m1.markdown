# David Stinnette - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to improve my study habits and focus. I made a daily schedule of study times before and after school to stick to each day. I met with mentors, other students and instructors to pick up tips & tricks when solving new problems. Finally I stuck to pomodoros when studying alone to help me stay focused when sitting at my computer. I now feel much more comfortable problem solving the unknown.

### End of Module Assessment

* Good comfort with getting started
* Some difficulties with variables vs literal data
* Algorithmic thinking is close, but still trying to think through
syntax and problem solving at the same time
* Going to be a pass but with ZERO margin for error

* Ruby Syntax & API - 3
* Ruby Style - 3
* Blocks & Enumerations - 3
* Testing - 3
* Workflow - 3
* Collaboration - 3

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Friday, July 31st.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dastinnette/Chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this week long project I built a parsing machine that converts markdown to html. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Program Works
* No extensions
* Emphasis can be refactored

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dastinnette/LinkedLists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this week long project I built a linked list with several searching/appending methods and tests. It was evaluated by Jeff with the following results:

* 27 tests, all passing
* Wrote a pile of junk, then deleted and rewrote cohesively
* Tests are really good
* Implementation could use more encapsulation / reuse of internal code

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dastinnette/EnigmaPlus)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this week long project I built an algorithm that encrypts, decrypts and cracks a coded message. It was evaluated by Jeff with the following results:

* some successes, some struggles -- encrypt and decrypt work pretty well
* would both like to spend more time refactoring, share functionality, reduce duplication
* crack works sometimes -- only with our sample key
* struggled through File I/O but eventually got it figured out
* want to work on testing File I/O
* progress was fast early then stalled in the middle around File I/O
* had challenges with Git and working across machines, tricky to work at home when split apart. Would like to do a student-led session about workflow.
* 46 tests all pass
* when writing tests be careful not to "echo" the implementation -- try to always use literal values instead of doing calculations in the test
* put test support files in /test/fixtures or /test/support
* implementation has lots of good parts but some gaps in clarity, maybe helped with a little rethinking of variable/method names and how the words become paragraphs

* Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/roseak/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html)

This was a two week project where we worked with class relationships in Ruby to create a database. I was paired with Rose Kohn and we were evaluated by Mike Dao.

* 143 tests, 262 assertions
* 97.73% coverage
* No sanitation complaints
* 2 minutes and 42 seconds

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3  
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* I delivered 100% of requested feedback, including to four other students who requested it.

* Feedback for me: "I'd love to hear both positive and constructive feedback on how I'm doing and how I'm supporting our cohort and Turing."
* Super positive - kept the mood light even during trying times!
* Really glad David stuck around to be in this cohort. He is hard working, encouraging, and fun.
* It was a challenge pairing for me, for the first time, and exhausting at times, but I'm also proud of how we were often able to step back when having a disagreement and reset our communication. Even though it was difficult for me, I'd be happy to work with David again.

### Playing a Part

* On Saturday, July 18, I attended a Turing bike ride with 3 other Turing staff. I rode 20 miles on my fixie in my PJs with no water. It was more fun than it sounds.
* On Sunday, July 19, I attended a Turing fly fishing trip with 3 other Turing students and staff. We didn't catch a damn thing all day and thought we lost Horace to the wild, but RMNP is beautiful, so it's cool.
* One Monday, July 20, I helped multiple students with Chisel refactoring, told a few jokes. The former was actually appreciated.  
* On Tuesday, August 4, I organized and will oversee a Turing fantasy football league of 12 students & staff. I'm already brainstorming what to do with my first place winnings.
* On Saturday, August 8, I led a scrabble prep class attended by 4 other Turing students. I wasted several hours of their time and mine.
