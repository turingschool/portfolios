### Attendance

I was present every day I was able this module with the exception being several days where I had to attend to my knee and consult with my surgeon. These absences were approved in advance by the truly wonderful and understanding Meeka and Steve.

## Self Evaluation Scores

##### End-of-Module Assessment

    - 3: Excused from assessment

- A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates that skill across a variety of work.

     - 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

    - 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

- Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop their own skills.

    - 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.

##### Peer & Instructor Feedback

- Turing student accelerates the growth of those around them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

    - 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback to shape their own character and behavior.

### Feedback

* from Steve Pentler: Dave is the essence of optimism. Even after he woke up one morning with a completely dysfunctional leg, Dave never complained or made any excuses over the course of the project. He does a great job of providing heat checks and keeping the MVP as the number one priority. He has an acute sense for when it’s time to step away, alter the approach, or ask for help, which is something I struggle with.

PRIOR FEEDBACK

* from Brant Wellman: David has been an important addition to the 1510 Cohort. It is not easy jumping into a tight group of individuals that are used working together, however I feel that Dave has done that seamlessly. He clearly contributed to his group during the Pivot and contributes as an individual to the group as well. He is not afraid to ask questions of others and he doesn't do so needlessly. In fact, I would encourage Dave to ask questions sooner rather than struggle with an issue as long as I have seen him struggle. Even just rubber-duckying the problem to someone else will add value.
* from Beth Sebian: David and I have interacted in mod three together as classmates, throughout months of morning posse exercises, and on personal projects outside of class. I first interacted with David when I solicited help on the “Turing” Slack channel for a personal project related to open data. David volunteered and we paired together during a break week to get the project up and running. I only later learned that David was just a module ahead of me, based on his comfort with pairing and asking the right questions to troubleshoot issues that came up, I assumed he was about to graduate. I appreciated both his willingness to show up, and the enthusiasm he showed when he did. In the many interactions I’ve had with him since, David has come across as a thoughtful, motivated, insightful guy.
David has also stood out to me as a good citizen here at Turing: 1) He volunteered to help moderate student sessions on “Allyship,” 2) Following our jobs talk with Marissa, Turing’s career coach, he approached me about partnering on a student-led session to share our experiences from our job searches and previous coaching. And finally, 3) David is unique in that he always says hi when I pass him in the hallway, and regularly checks in on me and our fellow classmates to see how we’re doing. He is genuine and engaged, and that’s made a difference for me here at Turing.
I haven’t had a chance to pair with David on a class project yet, but I hope to before I graduate.
* from Adam Jensen: GOOD: At this moment, I met David exactly 8 months and 3 days ago. I started Turing on July 6. David has always been a cultural leader in just about every group I've seen him enter. David has also been VERY rational and VERY Logical, which can be a breath of fresh air. I've been impressed with David in the last 6 weeks. During the most recent module, David appears to be crushing it. I occasionally catch up with him and he ALWAYS seems calm. I've seen David put in really hard weeks and be back for more. I would fully endorse David for both his tech and soft skills without hesitation. Any company will be lucky to have him on board.
BAD: Pairing with David is good. I would offer the following though… At times I felt like David would try and understand every bit and piece of code. Funny thing is, I like that attribute. But I felt like David can sometimes get caught up on small things, which halts/slows the building process. I don't ever want David to stop being curious as I see it as a HUGELY advantageous quality. But I wish David would know that he is a good programmer and that sometimes it pays to spike code..spike more code… then deep dive and gain understanding.
* from Torie Joy-Warren: David is a rare mix of assertive and conscientious. Working with him on the pivot, he did a great job taking the lead and getting the project rolling without steam-rolling through any decisions. He actively sought out everyone’s opinions and was great at reconciling any differences. I admire his calm demeanour and his respect for his classmates. If you work at all with David, he will earn your respect and it will be much deserved.
* from Jeff Ruane: Pairing with you has been great, both over this module and in past modules. You're great at keeping your stress under control, you have a real talent for lightening the mood of a group, and in general you're just approachable and easy to get along with. It was definitely to the detriment of 1507 when we lost you, but it's great to see you killing it now. As far as code goes, I've been impressed by your ability to just power through tough problems. It seems like you'll come to me with a problem, and we'll make more or less minimal progress, but then by the next day you have it solved and moved on to the next thing. It's been a pleasure!
* from Travis Haby: David Stinnette has strong interpersonal skills, and brings a lot of joy to those around him. Whether its cracking a pun to keep his team’s spirits up or his strong ability to persist in the face of adversity, I think he brings a lot to the table. In my experience working with David he has room for growth with being able to show independence in situations that require complex problem solving. I think shifting his mindset to a ‘let me tinker with this until I get to the root of the problem’ way of thinking will serve him well moving forward, and if combined with his grit and determination will certainly result in future success.

### Giving Feedback

* to Steve Pentler: Steve is the man. He’s got a ridiculous work ethic, communicates well, and tackles problem solving with an easy to understand and logical approach. While I kept preaching caution and completing the MVP first, he was good about encouraging us to push through the MVP so we had time to tackle some interesting extensions. It was a pleasure to pair with Steve during our Gametime project.

### Playing a Part

* I planned and led Hamilton Posse with the legendary Beth Secor.
* I wrote blogs posts oulined above, participated in Friday sessions, and paired with 1603 through 1510 on all types of projects.
* Provided emotional support to many, many peers.

## Notes

* Not concerned about being the "fastest" programmer, sometimes sacrificing completion
* Program has been the toughest thing I've done
* Starting back in May of 2015 and having my ego constantly cut down has been difficult "...but has without a doubt made me a better programmer" (quotes added by student as to not be taken out of context and misrepresented)
