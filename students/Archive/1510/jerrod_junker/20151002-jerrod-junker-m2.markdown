        Feedback--

        Regis-

        I think that Jerrod is really smart and has a lot of knowledge to share. I wish he could be a bit more vocal but he has been working on that skill set and I can see a good amount of improvement on his part. I really enjoy talking to him about gaming and computers and I am excited to see him translate his skills learned at Turing into the gaming world.

    Adam - 

    Good: Very sharp and I think you have a great personality. You are not overbearing and seem to bring good ideas. All of my interactions with you have been positive. I like to ask you questions, cause I know you have a lot to offer…BAD:  I would love to see a more direct and assertive approach. I feel that you might just be shy… but it can come across as not being engaged. For example, I always feel that you would rather work solo, so I usually just let you work solo. Outside of feedback… Seriously, let’s pair on future stuff.

    Gave to Adam-
    Something you do well: You’re usually very open to trying things that you haven’t before and learn them in depth(like paperclip).  Something you could improve on: Seeking to pair with people more than you already do could be beneficial

    Gave to Regis-
    Regis is always talking about interesting new discoveries (see watercooler slack channel) and is always bringing interesting new ideas and technologies to projects as well. He’s also fun to talk to when it comes to gaming and computers and when he needs to is willing to put in a lot of hard work to get a project done.

    

Playing a Part
    Make sure I'm always curtious and prepared to help anyone who may need it.
    Worked on reaching out and becoming more of a part of turing in general.
    Offered to pair with anyone in 1508 multiple times.
    Paired with Nicole on her chisel project.
