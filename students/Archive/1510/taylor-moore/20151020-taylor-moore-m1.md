## Your Mission

I came to Turing to gain programming skills. Programming always seemed like a vast ocean, and I never knew where to step in. My mission is to work hard and develop a unique set of skills that will help me succeed in the field I am interested in

## End of Module Assessment

__Notes:__

* Solid initial workflow
* Getting a little lost when the algorithm gets harder -- need to separate algorithm from implementation
* Some issues with basic syntax
* Trouble building/manipulating hashes and arrays

__Scores:__

*Ruby Syntax & API*
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

*Ruby Style*
* 2: Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity

*Blocks & Enumerations*
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

*Testing*
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

*Workflow*
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

*Collaboration*

### Retake

__Notes:__

* Started off a bit nervous, but was fine once we got going
* Tests were fine. Tested one small piece at a time. Wanted to jump ahead
* Ultimately had a good understanding of blocks and Enumerables.

## Attendance

I was late to class on Friday, October 30th. I arrived at 9:45am due to my alarm not going off.

## Projects

### Challenge: Jungle Beat

__Instructor:__ Jeff

__Repository:__ https://github.com/Tman22/jungle_beat

__Comments:__

* 15 tests
* Tests look pretty good. Break multiple assertions into multiple tests. Put some more thought into edge cases.
* Implementation is solid with some repetition / opportunity to reuse code. Needs a bit of refactoring.
* Watch out for whitespace

__Scores:__

*Functional Expectations*
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

*Test-Driven Development*
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into* Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

*Fundamental Ruby & Style*
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion*
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Challenge: Enigma

__Instructor:__ Mike

__Repository:__ http://github.com/tman22/new_enigma

__Comments:__

* it works!
* one extension
* 37 tests
* methods generally tested in isolation
* Would like to have seen some edge cases, sad path testing

__Scores:__

* *Overall Functionality:*         4
* *Fundamental Ruby & Style:*      3
* *TDD:* 3
* *Breaking Logic Into Components:* 4

### Challenge: Http Yeah You Know Me

__Group:__ James Crockett & Taylor Moore

__Instructor:__ Mike

__Repository::__ http://github.com/tman22/http_stuff

__Comments:__

* 25 tests,
* tests should be structured so that they dont require interactivity
with postman/whatever
* some opportunities to refactor down longer methods, and clear up some
unnecessary variable assignment

__Scores:__

*Overall Functionality*
* 3: Application implements four iterations

*Fundamental Ruby & Style*
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

*Test-Driven Development*
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

*Breaking Logic into Components*
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Challenge: Headcount


__Group:__ Hector & Taylor

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repository::__ https://github.com/hectorhuertas/headcount

__Comments:__

* Testing / TDD seems solid overall
* Good use of tests to make sure that each object can be used in
isolation
* Open-ended interfaces for objects makes it easy to pass customized
data in for each test case
* top-level data processing and repo / record-creation flow is clean
and easy to follow
* Code complexity & length starts to fall down a lot in the analysis
section. We discussed some ways to improve this by isolating argument
and option parsing (determining which branch is need) from the methods
that actually perform the calculations
* Overall we might not reduce the amount of code, but we can probably
organize in a way that's easier to follow
* Finally, completion issues with the spec harness seem to stem from
challenges dealing with data gaps or formats -- probably needed to
identify this problem earlier. maybe by including more "bad data"
in the tests from the beginning
* Completion is good through I2 baseline (happy path); then has gaps
around the missing data / edge case parsing

__Score:__

* *Functional Expectations* 2
* *TDD* 3
* *Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components* 3
* *Fundamental Ruby & Style* 2 -- needs some work refactoring analysis methods
* *Enumerable & Collections* 4
* *Sanitation* 3

## Community

**Giving Feedback**

* Aaron Greenspan is very creative, which gives him a natural knack for solving complex problems. He shines when any difficult problem comes around. The truly impressive part is his ability to communicate his ideas. However, his determination to solve problems can sometimes blind him from other paths. He is always willing to help solve problems, he'll even fall down rabbit whole with you just to see what happens.

* Hector is smart, quick to understanding problems and works hard! Occasionally Hector needs to be told to explain his thought process. A weakness of Hector is he knows his process really well but is uncertain when presented with new ideas. Originally I thought it would be hard to work with Hector, but to my surprise it was a great experience and I would happily do it again.

* Brant has great communication skills. The few times I've paired with him, we've discussed a plan before starting. He's quick to find solutions and pick up ideas. Brant has been improving his test writing skills and is good at checking errors. He contributes to the group and always checks into help.

**Being a Community Member**

* *Aaron Greenspan:* “Taylor has an impressively sharp and intuitive grasp of deep and/or complex problems.  In our two experiences pairing together, when I wanted to take things slow — write on the white board, create smaller tests, etc —  Taylor was already multiple steps ahead of me.  This is his strength and his weakness, as his difficulty in backing up and taking things slowly sometimes puts Taylor in a situation where he has bitten off more than he can chew.  As a pair partner he is flexible and eager to both learn and contribute. He will bring much value to his group work above and beyond his talents in programming."

* *Hector Huertas:* Taylor is a great partner. His communication skills are great and he's very easy to work with. Although he represents these skills, he might be too nonchalant while working on an assignment. Sometimes I felt he needed to feel more pressure to be more productive. In programming, he is great at force-breaking problems, he finds solutions for dark and hard to trace errors that doesn't seem to make sense. At the same time, he could improve his workflow for general problems: sometimes he starts wandering around code and trying things here and there when the answer is clear on the error stack trace. I think all around his approach is too time consuming. He could benefit from a more standard approach to problem solving and keep his dark magic for the times when it's really needed. In conclusion, great experience working with him.

* *Jamie Crockett:* "Taylor is super collaborative and comes up with creative solutions to problems, in part because he's very comfortable with less-frequently used enumerables such as 'reduce.' He always strives to create something in the most efficient way possible (which is a good instinct, but sometimes his infatuation with the best possible way distracts him from the bigger picture). He has a calming demeanor that I found easy to work with and communicates expectations well."

* *Brant Wellman:* "I have paired with Taylor on a couple of exercises where he was an engaged partner and helped contribute to the problems and exercises. He is active in contributing and vocal about what his opinions are, but not at all overbearing. Taylor will continue to be a valuable partner in future pairs by continuing to contribute in this fashion."

**Playing a Part**

I've supported the larger Turing community in these ways:
* Refilled coffee when empty
* Replaced toilet paper when empty
* Provide moral support/technical advice when needed
