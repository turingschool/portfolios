# Taylor Moore - M3 Portfolio

## Your Mission

To successfully pass the module feeling confident in my skills as a developer. Learn how to create my own API and be able to consume external APIs.

## Goals

* Work on communication with groups.

* Learn more about authorization and what options are out there.

* Start to learn my way around JavaScript


## Mod-3 Assessment

Assessor: Josh M.

Notes:
  * API has created_at and updated_at
  * Create and Delete work using Postman
  * Good start to the BestBuyService

#### 1. Ruby Style and Syntax

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

#### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes and has at least 12 commits on the project


## The Pivot

#### Group: Taylor Moore & Shannon Paige & Aaron Greenspan

Technical Assessor: Josh M.
<br>
<br>
 Client Assessor: Tess
<br>
<br>
GitHub: https://github.com/afg419/the_pivot

Production Link: https://mount-doom.herokuapp.com

Technical Notes:
  * Probably the most ambitious Pivot to date. A good amount of business logic.
  * Client Notes: Very ambitious. I was suprised by how much work they were able to get done.

### Scores

**Client Scores:**

* Completion: ***4*** <br>
* Organization: ***3*** <br>
* User Experience: ***3.5*** <br>
* Extensions: ***4+*** <br>

** Technical Scores**

* Test-Driven Development: ***2***: Project shows gaps in test      usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).
* Code Quality: ***3+***: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* Git Workflow: ***3***: Developers make small, atomic commits to document their process and use pull requests to introduce new code to their codebase. Developers use pull requests to introduce new code their codebase and give feedback before merging them in.

## ApiCurious

GitHub: https://github.com/Tman22/gitmore
<br>
<br>
Assessor: Lovisa
<br>
<br>
 Notes:
 * Very good separation of logic Has almost all functionality (is working on POST) Had some troubles getting testing and VCR implemented, we worked through it together and got it working Using Nokogiri + API Better naming Refactor out duplication Overall a very nice project, duplication and naming are things he would have gotten to

Assessor: Lovisa

Notes:

* 5 failing in spec harness

* api-design: ***3***
* queries: ***3***

## Feedback

#### Jordan Lawler:
* I worked with Taylor on the “Personal (not so much personal I guess) project”.  Taylor is a passionate visionary who contributes to all aspects of the project.  Taylors strongpoints include conceptual planning,  code implementation, and effective communication.  Decisions on code architecture are debated and strengthened through discussion with Taylor, ensuring the structure of code is moving in the correct direction the first time more often than not.  This attention to detail carries into code implementation as well.  As  a team member, Taylor works hard and positively, his passion for the project pushes the team through difficult times.

* My two criticisms for Taylor are:
 1. Focus on the now rather than future implementation (something I struggle with as much as he does)
 2. Get Sleep!  When Taylor gets tired, he begins to space out and wander, ending earlier in the night for more sleep may be more beneficial than pushing through the extra hour or two the night before.


 #### Aaron Greenspan:

  * I just learned how to program, but if I had been programming longer this would be more significant.  Just rambling right now.  What I’m trying to say, is that in my opinion, Taylor has undergone a massive maturation as a programmer since we worked together in module 2.  He is now assertive in every aspect of the coding process, from initial sketching out of a design, to detailed backend tinkering, to user experience on the front end.  He furthermore insists on getting the most out of his projects and his partners, actively seeking help and explanations, and consistently contributing to his considerable array (<— code joke) of technical resources.  My only constructive criticism for Taylor is to stop seeking out criticism, and to trust as I do that he brings an important and valuable contribution to any team.


  #### Shannon Paige:
* Taylor had such a positive, infectious spirit during the pivot.  He was instrumental in keeping our team spirits up, even when we got stressed. I loved his enthusiasm and curiosity. We worked on js together, which was new for both of us, and energy and contributions got us through it. His communication skills are through the roof, and he has a thirst for knowledge I'm envious of. Thanks for you!!


  #### Beth Secor:
  * Taylor needs to stop being such a sheep farmer and city up. He also needs to change his Catan profile picture, people aren't going to trade with you if they think you are some creepy old guy. How dare you suggest I settle on brick and wood just to serve your peasant needs. Wheat is golden, and yes, has a dark side. It's called ore. I may pair with you on catan one day, just to bring an end to the ridiculous reign of @steveoscaro and @crockett. Of course I'm a formidable opponent, I am the Wheat Queen.


  ## Giving Feedback

  #### Aaron Greenspan:
  * I have had the pleasure of being on a team with A-a-ron for two projects now. Seeing Aaron grow as a programmer has been a delight. His excitement and enthusiasm can fill a room, which allows him to lead a team into any situation. His ambitious will take him to new far off worlds like C++(STAY AWAY FROM SKYNET). Even with a beautiful mind he never forgets to help others learn and grow. In fact I would argue that he loves teaching as much as he does learning. If I were to nitpick, I would say managing stress would be something to work on. I can't wait to see what Aaron does next!


  #### Jordan Lawler:
  * Jordan and I are both macro thinkers. We spent a lot of time talking about the best way of approach the project. Although this can be a good strategy, it's not sustainable or efficient. I would say Jordan could work on getting small steps done and to keep moving forward(something we both could work on). Jordan's communication and attitude is fantastic. He stays positive an will work through long hours in the night. I am excited to continue to work through this project and learn with Jordan.


  #### Shannon Page:
  * Before Mod 3, I didn't really know Shannon. So I didn't know what to expect starting a 2 week project with her. I couldn't have been happier with an outside source. She killed the Jquery we worked on together and she is a design genius. I loved working with her because she not only had great communication but considered all options. I'm excited to see where Shannon goes and look forward to working with her again.



  #### Beth Secor:
  * Beth: You are a savage. Playing Catan with you has taught me how to be cruel and unreasonable. In tricky situations I think how would Beth screw everyone over. Before I played Catan, I thought WheatQueen was a cute nickname. Now I realize the WQ stands for what some would call the Dark Side. I’ve come to see it as the only way to survive. Although I admire your abilities, I think you need to work on placing settlements on more brick and wood. I could use some brick and wood.. So overall I think you are a formidable opponent! Just remember, I am always ready to team up against @steveoscaro and @crockett
