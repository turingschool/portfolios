## Your Mission

I came to Turing to gain programming skills. Programming always seemed like a vast ocean, and I never knew where to step in. My mission is to work hard and develop a unique set of skills that will help me succeed in the field I am interested in

## Community

**Giving Feedback**

* "Aaron was our team leader for TrafficSpy.  I quickly realized Aaron would be my perfect boss. He's a great listener and considers every suggestion. When he disagrees with a suggestion he will calmly explain his reason and why his way was more agile for our website. Aaron can get overly stressed, but once given a few minutes, he will jump back into his normal self. I found working with Aaron taught me a lot about programming. He constantly brought challenges to the group to complete. I’m excited to see what Aaron creates next!!"

* "During the time of Traffic Spy, I had the pleasure of having Penny as a partner. Our first DTR, I informed the group of my tendency to skip the error and go back to the code. She was constantly hounding on me to check errors, which developed a habit for me. So I praise her team engagement and team development! One thing Penny could work on is her imposter syndrome. She is a growing developer and is very good at it! She just needs to be more confident in her abilities! I am constantly surprised at Penny’s growth! I can’t wait to see more!"

* "During Little Shop, I finally got paired with Toni who is easily one of the best programmers I know. She is a hard worker that brings a lot to any project. When I was stuck, she would easily wave her and make it disappear. Toni does a great job with following errors and breaking things down to manageable steps. My only suggestions are when pairing try to be more open minded with other ideas. Calmly explain why your idea is superior and make sure they fully understand why.  I will say I wasn’t the best partner during this project. I was poor at communicating even when she reached out as a friend.  She really picked up my slack and helped me through some issues. She is an excellent programmer and even a better friend. I can’t wait to see what her future holds."

* "Working with Brenna on Little Shop was a treat. She is incredible with logic problems and is a level 10 wizard in CSS. I appreciate her because she spent time teaching me cool CSS tricks. Brenna has great ideas and is constantly challenging the group. Her positive attitude shines even when she's struggling. She quickly adapts to new ideas and can make any page look good in minutes! I would like to see Brenna be more assertive with her ideas. Otherwise, she was very supportive to me when I was in need, which makes her a great group member and a better friend. It was my pleasure to be on Brenna’s Team Awesome."

* "I had the pleasure of working with JP during our mini-project. Being my first time working with JP I didn’t know what to expect. To my joy, he was a fantastic group member. We constantly challenged each other to go down a rabbit hole just to find an answer. Which doesn’t seem like a good idea but honestly I learned a lot working with him because of it! Before we start every day we would DTR. After finishing large areas, we would discuss how this will change our application. Not only is JP a fantastic programmer, he also has great communication skills. The working relationship was one of the best I’ve had and I look forward to working with him in the future."

**Being a Community Member**

* *Aaron Greenspan:* "I had a ton of fun working with Taylor on TrafficSpy which was, to this day, perhaps the project group I experienced the least friction in so far at Turing… He is empathetic, willing to listen, willing to speak up, and can get really excited about things (NAVBARS!).   After the project ended, I was very surprised when Taylor complimented me on some pairing/group project skills I had taken for granted; things like regularly trading off with typing at the keyboard and insisting on clear communication about what ideas needed implementing and how.  I’m not sure if those compliments were made in contrast to his pairing in previous groups.  But, if so,  I think Taylor needs to be more assertive in insisting on a positive working relationship which includes him to the fullest.  Taylor deserves partners who give him the space to implement his ideas his way; they never led our project astray, and Taylor is such a  good team member it’d be a shame if his partners didn’t treat him the same.  I’d like to see Taylor at the head of a group next module, and would gladly follow his lead if I’m lucky enough to work with him again."

* *Penny Garrett:* "I had a great time working with Taylor on Traffic Spy. His enthusiasm and motivation is infectious and, frankly, endearing. He made me feel supported and respected and also kept the whole team laughing all the way through.  I feel like I saw Taylor grow an incredible amount as a developer on this project and I look forward to see where he goes from here!"

* *Toni Rib:*  "During Little Shop, I finally got paired with Toni who is easily one of the best programmers I know. She is a hard worker that brings a lot to any project. When I was stuck, she would easily wave her wand and make it disappear. Toni does a great job with following errors and breaking things down to manageable steps. My only suggestions are when pairing try to be more open minded with other ideas. Calmly explain why your idea is superior and make sure they fully understand why.  I will say I wasn’t the best partner during this project. I was poor at communicating even when she reached out as a friend.  She really picked up my slack and helped me through some issues. She is an excellent programmer and even a better friend. I can’t wait to see what her future holds."

* *Brenna Martenson:* "I had the opportunity to work with Taylor on our final project for Module 2 called Little Shop of Orders. Taylor has a fantastic ability to commit to a task and put in the time and effort to get the job done. He is always enthusiastic to learn from his mistakes and take on new challenges. Although it is clear he has a knack for programming, consistent communication when working remotely is an area for improvement. It was challenging at times to know where Taylor was at with certain tasks, which made collaboration difficult.  In person, I felt that he and I had an excellent workflow. We could bounce ideas back and forth and find an effective solution to the problem at hand. I would be happy to work with him on future projects!"

* *Joseph Perry* I had the opportunity to work with Taylor on the module two mini-project and couldn’t have asked for a better partner. Taylor is highly motivated and excels at logical problem solving, quickly becoming comfortable with new Rails concepts. I particularly appreciated Taylor’s consistency and patience in planning out our app. Taylor also proved to be extremely easy to work with as he communicated well and was calm and collected throughout the entire project. I look forward to working more with Taylor on larger projects going forward!
