# Emily Blanchard (1510) Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission

Turing was the perfect choice to conquer my 3 greatest fears: money, technology, groups of white people larger than 3. These things have caused me pain in the past, and that won't easily happen again.

Helping others is what "fills my tank". It makes me able to do for myself, help even more people, and make the world a kinder place. This does not work unless I can be myself, which is not comfortable for all involved in the beginning.

I thrive on stress, once my basic needs are met. A human can always improve, do more, persevere. My growth during Module 1 has proven this, once again. I know successful completion of the Turing program is part of "future me", whatever the path to arrive may look like.
**My goal for after graduation is to secure a job; doing something I can be proud of, in some city, where I make as much or more than I did my last year of teaching, that includes health insurance.**

Below is a list of my Projects, and scores from Module 1.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emblou2/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

**Linked List that makes sounds.** Emphasis on practicing breaking a program into logical components,
distinguishing between classes and instances of those classes,
understanding how linked lists work to store and find data,
testing components in isolation and in combination.

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me (Pair Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emblou2/http-yeah-you-know-me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

**Build a functioning web server** Emphasis on practicing breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components,
using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels,
understanding how the HTTP request/response cycle works, implementing basic HTTP requests and responses.

Assessed By: Horace Williams

#### Notes:

* Overall structure is heading in a good direction - parsing request info into semantically named keys and values of a hash is useful
* Some leakage of non-parsing responsibilities into the parser object, so be attentive to that.
* Think especially about names and responsibilities of objects with respect to the methods they are performing -- do they actually fit
* Testing is good on the things it covers but overall lacking in quantity
* Completion is solid through I3 but didn't get into game application


#### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3



#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emblou2/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

**Markdown to HTML program.** Emphasis on breaking a program into logical components,
test components in isolation and in combination,
apply enumerable techniques in a real context,
read text from and write text to files.

## Community

### Giving Feedback
* JP was one of the first people I met on 1510’s first day of class. He is that guy: you sit next to JP and just feel better. The theory is that it’s  his calming presence, or just magic. I eagerly await the chance to work with JP on a pair/group project. Mr. Perry is always working to better his coding process, learn new thing, etc... He has the admiration of the entire class of 1510.

* I had the pleasure of working with Steve Pentler on 1510’s first paired assignment. Although we have very different learning/production styles, Steve was a great pair member from day 1. We both made our missteps, but had really productive/cool days as well. Mr. Pentler’s patience is legendary, as is his humor, wit, and drive to succeed. I look forward to more projects with Steve P.

* While I have not yet had the pleasure of pairing with Penney Garrett, she is a joy to be around. Penney is available for advice/help on projects, Turing culture, or just checking in on classmates “emotional temperature”. Many individuals in 1510 frequently voice their excitement that Penny is with us. She is a rockstar as a human and as a coder.

* I have not yet had the pleasure of working on a project with Jordan, but I look forward to that happening soon. Mr. Lawler has an amazingly quick brain, with enthusiasm to match. His energy is contagious. Jordan’s skill set is varied and deep: musician, lover of puzzles, empathetic/sympathetic, coding, coolness, a desire to always improve in everything. One reason I’m so glad to have chosen Turing is meeting people like Jordan Lawler, that I might not have met under other circumstances.

### Being a Community Member
* Emily is a treasure. It’s rare for me to meet other people who are as willing to wear their heart on their sleeve as I am, so in Emily I feel I’ve found a kindred spirit. Despite struggling during this module, she has kept an unrelentingly positive outlook and continued to push through. I admire and respect that tenacity, and know that it will only make her stronger in the end.  I absolutely consider Emily a friend and look forward to working together in the future --Penney Garrett

* Emily’s ability to present her needs and concerns was essential to our success as a team. When I hit a wall debugging or unconsciously tried to run away with the project, she reeled me in and reestablished our vision. Emily has a strong desire to improve technically, and I’ve seen her acting on it since we worked together. Aside from programming, she’s a positive force in the cohort that isn’t afraid to share her vulnerabilities with the group. I can say with confidence that everyone has a lot of respect for Emily. --Steve Pentler

* Getting to know Emily has been a true pleasure. Of all the people I’ve met at Turing, she is by far the most willing to put herself out there and connect with people. Her openness, extreme level of positivity, activeness in the community, and unwavering support of her colleagues are both truly inspiring and greatly appreciated! --JP

* Although I did not have the opportunity to work with Emily this module, pairing was not necessary to illuminate just how great an addition Emily is to the Turing community.  Whether spreading her infectious positivity throughout the group, introducing lunchgoers to new and addicting math based games, or asking important questions that may have not been addressed otherwise, Emily is always looking to improve herself and others around her.  I cannot wait to see what Emily does in the coming months at Turing and beyond! --Jordan Lawler


### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Provided emotional support.

* Introduced cribbage, pentominos, and other games as stress relief for the lunch hour. Beth Secor has joined in by bringing in the game SET. She schools us all.

* Stayed situationally aware of supplies, replaced them quickly.

* Participated in four Friday "lunch roulettes".

* Working on getting bus passes donated for those in need. It will happen.

* Made introduction for a future partnership between a business outside of the US and Turing.

* Made several introductions for businesses/people in Denver for future partnerships with Turing.

## Review

### Notes

* Dedication shown in projects but still missing the upward trend we want to see
* Group projects show strong contribution and engagement with adequate results
* Your engagement with the cohort and community is quite strong; people
seem excited to have you around and value your contributions to the group
* We feel good about your potential and ability, but are concerned about
whether our methodologies and the style of content we deliver is successful
for you

### Outcome

* End of Module Assessment: 1
* Individual Work and Projects: 2
* Group Work and Projects: 3
