# Edgar Duran - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My goal this module was to get the best grasp of JavaScript that I could in order to give myself the best possible chance to obtain a job.
I also wanted to draft a strategy on how to go about finding jobs I am interested in and approaching them in a way that would give the best odds to get noticed and get an interview.

### Attendance

I attended class every day this module.

### Feedback

#### Give feedback

Slota has always been a great resource for me to bounce ideas off or when I am having trouble grasping a concept. I have frequently approached him when I am stuck on a problem after talking it out and receiving feedback from Slota I always leave with an answer or approach to solving a problem. But, perhaps most notably, having Slota as a team mate and friend has been on of the great gems throughout my career at Turing. We have been through much together and I feel privileged to call him my friend. I know that wherever he ends up he will find success because of his skills, positive attitude, and overall awesome character. Thanks for the memories, my friend.

Dan has been such a great resource for me ever since I started with 1510. He is such a knowledgable and talented programmer it has been a joy working with him. I know that whenever I need a better explanation on something or someone to look at why my code is not doing what I want I can count on Dan. I was lucky enough to work with him on Game Time and witnessed how smart and talented he is when it comes to coding. I can also say he is a great and easy person to work with in a team environment.  I can truly say that whatever professional team he joins will be lucky to have him.

Having Shannon in my cohort during the entirety of my Turing career has been a true blessing. Shannon has helped me get through problems so many times that I can not even count them. Her willingness to lend a hand at any time is what has made her one of my go to people anytime I have any trouble. I am confident that she will be an excellent developer and an asset to any company that hires her. More than anything I am lucky to call Shannon my friend.

Greg is an excellent and talented developer. I doubt there has been a project during the last 2 modules that Greg hasn’t helped me with at least one aspect of. He is a reliable source and his understanding of programming is extremely impressive.


#### Get feedback

"When Edgar and I were working on Game Time, we got into some pretty tight spots. We didn’t realize a corner we had backed ourselves into but Edgar never showed any frustration. He was always eager to work on the code and was beyond accommodating when I had some family issues distracting me. His ability to persevere in tough situations really got us through that project. It was because of him that our game really came to life and is something that I’m proud to show off both to friends and prospective employers. I know he’s going to kill it out there on the job market." - Dan Winter

"Edgar has been a great resource at Turing. After having lunch the first week of Module 1 (round 1), I was happy to turn to Edgar whenever I had a code-related issue. His help is always well-informed and he is able to guide me in the right direction. Edgar would be a great resource to any company." - Ilana Corson

"Edgar and I didn’t pair on any projects this module, but that didn’t stop us from working together. Whenever I needed help, Edgar was always there. Not only does he attack the material until he feels he understands it, but he has the same eagerness and enthusiasm to share what he’s learned. I’m so glad I’ve gotten to know him over our time at Turing, even if I do have a permanent bruise on my arm because of it. :simple_smile:" - Shannon Paige

"Edgar has gone out of his way to help me a couple of times this module.  One day I was struggling to implement a feature on my app and he was quick to come to the rescue as we got ready for lightning talks.  We paired another time as well and I was impressed with his grit in sticking through trying to get a hamburger dropdown to render properly.  After a good two hours, we did get thankfully get it working correctly.  I think that he’ll make a addition to any team he ends up working on." - David Whitaker

"Edgar’s allegiance to the Broncos is unquestionable. He’s also a pretty good developer, too! Edgar was immensely helpful with helping me to debug my RealTime app when I was still struggling to grasp web sockets as a whole idea. Omaha!" - Greg Armstrong

- I was part of the productivity lunch group
- I make it a point to grind coffee every day since we got the new grinder
- I have frequently attempted to help members of other cohorts since I can definitely empathize their struggle
