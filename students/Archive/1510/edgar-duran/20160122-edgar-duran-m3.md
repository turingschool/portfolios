# Edgar Duran - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My focus for this module was to become proficient at rails and confident that I can solve any problem thrown at me. I also wanted to stay more on top of my tasks and do all of the assigned work in order to be at the level I should be.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided feedback to Aaron, Marlo, Alon, and Dave S for this module.

### Being a Community Member

â€œHard working and reliable. Edgar volunteered to tackle several large pieces of the pivot and consistently delivered." - Dave Stinnette

"EdGAR was an excellent partner to work with on The Pivot. He is an excellent developer and has a strong understanding of Ruby and Rails. He is always driven and stays on task. He also somehow finds a way to have a lot of fun throughout the project. I thoroughly enjoyed working with EdGAR and look forward to pairing in the future. Oh and he is the only person that understands the movies I quote." - Marlo Major

"Edgar is able to pick up on new concepts extremely fast. We paired on his personal project for a bit. I could make of a code snippet that explained a concept I was thinking about and he was able to adapt it to his code base right in front of me. He is really adaptable and I think he is going to to great in Turing going forward!" - Matt Hecker

### Playing a Part

I strived to be more active in the community this module and more involved with people in other modules.
* I made a goal to attend more warm up this module. I probably attended twice as many as last module
* Having attended more warm-ups, I was able to help members of my posse frequently with projects I had already encountered.
* Adam and I conducted a student lead session on contributing to open source.
* Having stayed at turing later after school more often this module I always made sure to clean up after myself and tried to do my part by organizing dishes, cleaning, and keeping Turing tidy.
