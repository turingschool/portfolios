### Being a Community Member


Edgar did a great job completing the tasks that he took on and was really proactive on getting help when needed. It was impressive to see him take a task home for the evening and always come back with great code the following morning. - Matt Stjernholm

"It was great working with you again Edgar. You're easy to work with because you're always open to ideas and flexible with schedule, structure and workflow. Thanks for always keeping the mood light but focussed." - Matt Rooney

Working with Jhun was an absolute pleasure. His insistence on slowing things down to make sure we understood the code we were implementing really helped me learn on this project.  He is a hard worker and an awesome person, I would gladly work with him again. - Jhun de Andres

Edgar was a great partner during Traffic Spy. He kept me laughing  the whole time, which made me look forward to all of our pairing sessions. I think we made a great team and I would be happy to work with him again. - Shannon Paige 

### Playing a Part

I strived to be more active in the community this module. 
* I was regularly available to help 1510 students since I could empathize with their pain. I helped on various occasions with problems that they had on homework and projects.

* I participated in study events with other students on weekends on a regular basis
* Attended a film screening (Keep Jumbo Wild) with a large group of fellow students.
