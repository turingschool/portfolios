# Gregory Armstrong - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* In Module 4 I wanted to merge together a continuous process of learning all about JS and the front-end frameworks presented to us, while also beginning (and hopefully ending) my job search for primarily the Denver area, but elsewhere as well. Additionally, I wanted to increase my community presence, as this was noted as my biggest weakpoint in my Module 3 portfolio review. Overall I wish that I had been able to plan things out a little better so as to allow for no job-searching in Mod 4, but I still feel that I performed well considering the two ongoing processes.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through Module 4 was not assessed in a final, due to having enough points to finish without doing so.

### Attendance

I have attended almost every day and class session in Module 4 save for April 8th, due to illness.

#### Team Projects

#### (GameTime - Portal2D)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/portal2d)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this project, we (Beth Secor & Greg Armstrong) decided to recreate the game Portal in 2D using solely JavaScript. We were able to finish the game with 4 different levels, however none of the provided extensions really fit with the spirit of the game so we did not attempt them (multiplayer specifically was not really possible.) I learned a ton about JavaScript in this project, and overall found it to be my favorite project for all of Turing.

### Scores:

* Total Points: 278 / 300

Beth Secor's Feedback:

* "Greg lies! He told me making Portal would be easier than he actually thought it would be. Greg thought, cool I'll give Beth a false sense of security so she crushes this project and I can brag to my friends that I made Portal. Well congratulations Greg, your plan worked. Greg is such a hard working person, and on top of that he's sweet and kind and all around awesome to work with. He pushed us to work on a game that would be challenging because all of the different elements to even make the MVP of Portal. I'm glad he did because I learned so much and our game turned out to be pretty amazing. I hope one day we'll end up working at the same company saving the world and stuff."

Beth Secor's Second Feedback:

* "Greg is seriously the most ridiculous person ever. He is constantly shouting about bananas and puzzles. He is also very arrogant. He came up to me this morning and forced me to look at his weird modern art, and I had to nod and smile and say, "That's great Greg! You're so talented." Working on Game Time with Greg was awful. He just sat there and didn't listen to any of my suggestions. I couldn't take it anymore, and he brought out the Wheat Queen in me . I took over his brain with my powers and now Greg is a decent and kind guy that everyone loves. Deep down I know he's really an asshole."

#### Individual Projects :

#### (RealTime - Live Polling)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/RealTime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

In this project, I was to utilize WebSockets to create a polling app which was capable of updating and displaying results in real time. I was very happy with my overall implementation, but definitely did not push myself as hard as in the previous projects. This was partly due to fatigue resulting from the entirety of Turing, and partly due to attempting to job hunt simultaneously.

### Scores:

* Total Points: 129 / 200

#### (Scale Up - Fecho Group - JangleBaloo)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/Janglebaloo)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)

In this project, we were given the choice of a few different tracks and within each track a few different types of projects. I chose to recreate the oldschool media player Winamp using Electron / React. I really enjoyed working on this one as it was such a different flavor of project than what we're used to. I plan to continue to work on it to add additional features such as an audio visualizer or saveable / shareable playlists.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Beth Secor, Portal2D:

* "Working on GameTime with Beth was by far my most favorite project, as well as my most favorite pairing relationship throughout all of Turing. I had to tell a wee little fib at the start of the project relating to my confidence that we could do it well to get her onboard with it, but we did end up doing quite well so I have no remorse. I find Beth's determination and work-ethic to be of the highest quality. She has immense ability to work through tough challenges with a cool head, and is great at communicating her expectations for a project both prior to and during a project. She asked if we could work together on the project in the week prior to kicking it off, and i'm quite thankful that she did so, as I got to work with a truly outstanding developer as a result. I would recommend that she cut back on the threats of shanking though, that can be a bit of a detriment to the working relationship. Just kidding. No, I'm not."

Second Feedback for Beth Secor, totally serious stuff inbound:

* "All joking aside, Beth is a vicious individual whose personality borders on psychopathic, with murderous tendencies and no concern for human life. I have never felt fear during my time at Turing other than the times Ive spent pairing with her. I can understand the instructor’s fear as well, do you fail her and risk dying within the next 7 weeks, or pass her and subject the outside world to her wrath? I hope you have more strength than I do when it comes to that decision. She’s both an unstoppable force and an immovable object, a physics-based paradox that can never be solved."

Feedback for Edgar Duran, Badass Extraordinaire:

* "Edgar’s allegiance to the Broncos is unquestionable. He’s also a pretty good developer, too! Edgar was immensely helpful with helping me to debug my RealTime app when I was still struggling to grasp web sockets as a whole idea. Omaha!"

Feedback from Edgar Duran, Badass Extraordinaire:

* "Greg is an excellent and talented developer. I doubt there has been a project during the last 2 modules that Greg hasn’t helped me with at least one aspect of. He is a reliable source and his understanding of programming is extremely impressive."

### Being a Community Member

* Hosted the Hector-Hector-Bo-Bector Going Away Party on April 2nd. Hector became a true American on this day, and we sent him back to Spain in style.
* Attended Denver.rb on April 12th @ 6PM. It was my first Denver.rb meetup, and I primarily went to support Aaron Greenspan who was speaking there for the first time, as well as to see what it was all about.
* Attended Built-In-Brews Event @ Gusto on March 24th @ 5PM. I wanted to see what their office environment was like, and additionally to hand out little business cards relating to the Turing Back-End Program. Did some mingling' and a little bit of schmoozin'.
* Attended Built-In-Colorado's Fastest Growing Tech Companies event at The Lobby, on April 7 @ 6PM. Went there looking for jobs, got a couple of leads and conversations started but they didn't generate much in way of junior developer opportunities.
* Attended the Get Hired! A Better Job Fair at the Commons on Champa on April 14th @ 4pm. I'm in talks with Agathos.io after having talked to them at the event, really hoping it turns into at least an interview. I've got a phone call scheduled with them for this Friday, April 29th.
* Participated in a question and answer session with prospective students. Organized by Joanne for Friday, April 15th.
* Was chosen to lead the planning phases of the 1510 Graduation Dinner. With the help of Penney, was able to get something set up for the Friday night of our last week and will be joined by our Module Anchors for a grand ole time.
* Have continued to try and keep the #sunday-funday channel going, which is at this point basically just Taylor Moore, myself and occasionally Jared Roth playing soccer on the weekends. But it's fun.
* Built some cabinets for the Turing staff area on Tuesday, April 27th. I did it for the love of the community, honest.
