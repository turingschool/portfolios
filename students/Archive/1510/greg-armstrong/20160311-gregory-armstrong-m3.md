### Areas of Emphasis

* In Module 3 my focus is to develop a mastery of Rails while additionally creating a personal project which is useful and presentable to a future employer. This stage of the Turing program seems to be the biggest challenge in terms of flying free from the nest and stretching your wings. I feel decently comfortable with Rails after Module 2, but I want to finish Module 3 feeling supremely confident in my Rails abilities. One of my particular areas of interest to work on is to be able to truly turn what is being taught into knowledge, not just recognition. Recognition is easy to have for a short time, but wont last, while knowledge will stick with me for much longer. While moving forward on these goals, I'd like to also get my feet wet with and learn as much as I can about JavaScript, perhaps with a specific framework.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through Module 3 was assessed by Josh Mejia, results were as follows:

### Notes

* API: Doesn't quite meet the spec, we shouldn't have to specify `.json` in the url
* API: Index/Show/Delete works well
* Good job (of almost) catching exceptions in the api items controller
* In the api items controller#show: using `select` demonstrates knowledge of ActiveRecord but using serializers would be a better option.
* Gem `webmock` should only be in the test group
* Search: started implementing single and multi search but did not complete either feature. The Service itself is pretty much working for Single search, it's just not getting displayed
* Good use of Ruby objects to pass things around
* Could have tested more at the unit level for the service

### Scores

* Ruby Style & Syntax: 3+
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Testing: 3
* Progression / Completion: 3
* Workflow: 4

### Attendance

I have attended every day and class session in Module 3

#### Team Projects

#### (The Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/book-a-bunker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this project, we (Penney Garrett, Edgar Duran & Gregory Armstrong) were to take a previously created LittleShop project, and change it to serve a different product base. We went from selling items to help survive a zombie apocalypse (Aberzombie & Fitch), to renting out bunkers for weathering the apocalypse (Book-a-bunker.) We were evaluated by Josh Mejia with the following results:

### Scores:

* Test Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* Git Workflow: 3
* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 4
* Risk Taking / Creativity: 3

Penney Garrett's Feedback:

* “I struggled quite a bit with the Pivot and Greg was always super patient and available to help. I appreciate this on so many levels, and I think it is indicative of a great team player. When there is a time crunch it’s easy to just take over for someone who is struggling, but it takes a higher level of maturity and patience to set down your own work and help someone else through their questions and concerns. I was super impressed with Greg’s ability to think through difficult issues and explain them in a clear and concise manner. No doubt he is going to make, and already is, a fantastic developer."

Edgar Duran's Feedback:

* "Having Greg as a team member for the pivot was a God-send. He is a very talented and brilliant developer. His ability to find solutions to road blocks we encountered ensured that we got our work done and turned in a quality product. I am very impressed with his problem solving skills."

#### Individual Projects :

#### (ApiCurious - LegitHub)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/LegitHub)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

In this project, I was to design and build a service for consuming an API, in this case GitHub, that mimics the user experience of the original API.

#### (Rales Engine)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/rales_engine/tree/master/RalesEngine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In this project, I was to use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API for the SalesEngine database. I was evaluated by Tess Griffin with the following results:

### Notes:

* 5 failing spec harness tests
* A bit of repetition on the models for the find methods
* Great use of scopes
* Used a ton of ruby for the queries
* Controller logic should be brought down to the model level

### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3

#### (Personal Project - Summoner Stats)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/summoner_stats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

In this project, I was to create a web app from my own project idea. It had to authenticate with a third-party service, consume an API and solve a problem. I chose to authenticate with Twitter, consume the Riot Games API ( League of Legends ), and produce a stat-tracking app. It can show a player's recent stats, show the top 10 players in the region's stats, and compare the two data sets graphically. I was assessed by Tess Griffin with the following results:

### Notes:

* Solid project overall. Could do with some refactoring, especially the controllers.

* Completion: 3+
* Organization: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3
* Performance: 3

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Penney Garrett, Book-a-bunker:

* “I really enjoyed working with Penney on The Pivot. Her organizational skills were ​_pivotal_​ to our completion of the project. With a lot of tasks to juggle to transfer over an e-commerce site to another purpose, Penney was great about keeping our group focused on what tasks we needed for each checkin/assessment, and also was the leading force in our group for pushing to Heroku often to make sure everything was working properly. Her stylistic contributions to the site were great as well, I feel we owe much of the visual presentation of the project to her hard work."

Feedback for Edgar Duran, Book-a-bunker:

* "I feel quite lucky to have had Edgar as a project member on The Pivot. He was instrumental, in the beginning of the project, with advising Penney and myself on what sorts of things we should focus on to get through The Pivot with a quality project and solid scores. He also took it upon himself to tackle testing of our javascript date picker, which turned out to be a nightmare of a task. His communication while working outside of Turing on the project was excellent as well."

### Being a Community Member

* I've continued try and keep the Sunday-Funday slack channel going, although attendance has been limited in the colder months we've had recently. As it gets warmer, and daylight savings time occurs, I hope to increase participation by announcing the channel and its purpose on Thursday/Friday wrap-ups. We have met 4 of the 6 weeks of the module for soccer at Sloan's Lake, and I hope to extend that to all 6 weekends coming up in the next module.
* Small point, but I do my best to change paper-towel and toilet-paper rolls and discard the empty ones. Many folks like to just put the new roll on top of the empty cardboard roll, which is insanity.
* Jordan Lawler thinks I have a good "funny voice," which I perform often with Dad. The voice is based on TheLadies'Man character, Leon Phelps, developed by Tim Meadows of SNL.
