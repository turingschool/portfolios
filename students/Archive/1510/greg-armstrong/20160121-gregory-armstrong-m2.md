# Gregory Armstrong - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

In module 2 my focus was on taking my knowledge and usage of Ruby on Rails as far as possible. I feel as though I am comfortable with MVC and DOM, and can effectively build a usable web application with appropriate styling and user flow. I've grown very comfortable with using a PostgreSQL database and ActiveRecord queries to access my application's data stores, and look forward to scaling up my applications in Module 3.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through Module 2 was assessed by Rachel Warbelow, results were as follows:

### Notes

#### (Traffic Spy)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/traffic-spy-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

In this project we (Lenny Myerson, James Crockett & Gregory Armstrong) were to design and build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool which utilized Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL and ActiveRecord. It was to parse and analyze simulated HTTP requests which held tracking data and make the data analysis visible to the user. We were evaluated by Rachel Warbelow with the following results:

Scores (Notes):

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5 (Something weird happening with one feature test)
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web & Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3

James Crockett's Feedback:

* "Greg is one of the most calm, level-headed partners I've had at Turing. I pride myself on keeping a positive attitude, but when Lenny and I would show frustration during Traffic Spy, Greg was ever the optimist insisting, "We're close, guys. We're just missing something small." That tendency, in addition to his strict adherence to pomodoro breaks, kept the group morale up and prevented us from falling into avoidable ruts. Greg also has a sharp attention to detail and grasps larger concepts quicker than most. I gained a lot of respect for him both as a group member and team leader."

Lenny Myerson's Feedback:

* “Traffic Spy was the lowest stress project I had participated in at Turing and I think that had a great deal to do with Greg’s work style. Greg played the role of project manager for our group on Traffic Spy and he proved confident and competent in the role.  Greg was great about taking time when necessary to explain concepts or code snippets when I felt uncertain.  He seemed determined to enjoy the process while getting the job done and I couldn’t help but find that approach contagious. The very notion that these projects might not have to be a grind was introduced to me by Greg and I’m still trying to absorb that lesson. I look forward to working with Greg again."

#### (Rails Mini-Project: MoneyTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/MoneyTracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Steve Pentler's Feedback:

* "Greg, formally known as the “Intergalactic Gentleman,” was a pleasure to work with for our MiniProject. His calm, laid-back demeanor is deceptively productive. While others panic upon encountering a bug or getting behind an idealistic schedule, he maintains his focus on continuing progress and problem solving. His lack of frustration is remarkable. Our time together was short, thus the only feedback I have for the “Intergalactic Gentleman” is to work on timeliness."

#### (Little Shop of Orders: Apocalypsify)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bethsebian/apocalypsify)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

* In this project we (Beth Sebian, Jordan Lawler & Gregory Armstrong) were tasked to build a Ruby on Rails online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering. We were restricted to using the bcrypt gem for authentication, but otherwise needed to be able to place and view orders as well as manage products and categories (travesties) in addition to processing and completing the orders.

Evaluation Results:

* Passes spec harness
* Hardest: one of the statewide test methods
* This was our best workflow project
* Started with Waffle but fell off it because we were together all the time
* 166 tests all pass
* Felt that we made good choices early with the data structures
* Really solid work

Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 4
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 3
* Testing: 3.5
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 3

Beth Sebian's Feedback:

* "Greg is a solid team-member with valuable leadership skills. I've been especially impressed with his judgment around project flow and making decisions about how to spend our time, communicate, and divide work. I've also observed that Greg does a great job making space for his other teammates to flourish; he seems willing to adapt to strategies that he would not choose independently because they are a better fit for his teammates. This flexibility can bring exponential benefit to a team. He has a level-headed approach to the work, is clearly committed, but not zealous about it. While his versatility is a great asset, there are times when I think he could step in to redirect his teammates if he thinks they are spinning wheels, instead of withdrawing. It’s a delicate task, and should be undertaken judiciously, but I suspect he could do it convincingly."

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Beth Sebian, Apocalypsify:

* “Ive really enjoyed working on the LittleShop of Orders (Apocalypsify version) with Beth. This project was a first for me in terms of large-scale branching and regular division of labor, and Beth was very communicative about what tasks she was undertaking while also quite good about creating pull requests to merge in new functionality when the time came. Her creativity and humor was a perfect fit for our shop’s subject matter and styling, and it made the work less tedious than some recent projects like TrafficSpy. One bit of constructive criticism I would add is that I would’ve enjoyed it if we had had more face-to-face pairing/team-coding on the project, but I understand that unexpected sickness and other obligations, such as pet at at home, can make that a bit difficult to organize and execute.”

Feedback for Jordan Lawler, Apocalypsify:

* “I had a phenomenal time working on LittleShop of Orders (Apocalypsify version) with Jordan. His keen eye for the visual design of the website is admirable, and I learned quite a bit about website design and user flow while working with him. He’s very determined while at work and more than willing to put in the time necessary to turn out a quality product. I owe much of my overall happiness with the Apocalypsify project to his contributions and ideas, and am satisfied that this project is the first one I’ve been apart of that I’d be proud to show to a potential future employer. One thing I'd note for possible improvement would be his Git workflow, which at times would leave us asking us if he was still working off of master. It never caused any catastrophes, just minor issues with merge conflicts.”

Feedback for Lenny Myserson, TrafficSpy:

* “It seems so long ago, but working with Lenny on TrafficSpy was one of my favorite group-project-experiences to date. Lenny’s laid-back style helped keep the project workflow calm and the progress continuous. Lenny did a great job while driving the project for the group, and additionally had fantastic contributions while navigating. His ability to diagnose errors was invaluable, as he would often catch errors or find their source quicker than either Jamie or I. A constructive feedback that I’d like to leave for Lenny is that at times he’ll mention that he feels as though he’s missing something or not quite up to speed with the issue being worked on, and yet I never felt that way outside of when he would reference it. He’d do well to believe in himself just a wee bit more.”

Feedback for James Crockett, TrafficSpy:

* “My experience working with Jamie (and Lenny!) on TrafficSpy was one of my favorite experiences working in a group so far at Turing. We all paired continuously throughout the project, which was quite helpful to me to be able to draw upon both of their knowledge bases while learning Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Jamie is great at tracking down the root causes of error traces, and I learned a lot about general refactoring while working with him. TrafficSpy was, in my opinion, one of my best projects in terms of how well we refactored our code to push logic down the stack, and I owe a lot of that to working with Jamie. We fed off of each other’s ideas due to the friendly interactions while working, and we were able to complete the project in a comfortable timeframe due to his willingness to put in ample time for working."

### Being a Community Member

* Started a Sunday-Funday slack channel for meeting up on Sundays with fellow Turing students to do outdoor activities together. Recent weather and holidays has cut it short, but we had 3 great meetups that included frisbee, football and a brewery visit. I plan to keep this going throughout the rest of my Turing modules, weather permitting.
* Organized 2 weekday sessions for playing pickup-soccer with some of my cohort mates.
* Hosted a New Years Eve party, invited my cohort specifically and posted an open invitation to it on the Turing channel.
* Attended the Kids Who Code demo night, which was surprisingly really awesome. It was interesting to see what types of things the kids wanted to build, and they seemed really into the idea of building things with code.
