### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
In module 3, I wanted to keep up with the little readings and helpful but not mandatory assignments. I feel like I accomplished that because it was extremely helpful from the beginning of the module when we created our Weather App. I also knew my personal project was going to be a test for me to see if I really understood the material. So my goal was to take it slow and understand the logic behind each part. It was slow process and I came close to not having my ideal MVP but it all worked out in the end. I feel accomplished and I'm proud with what I actually shipped out by myself.

### End of Module Assessment: Quizzer

#### Final Evaluation from Brittany

Specification Adherence - 2: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

Determining the right tools for the job - 4:  Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them

Following Documentation - 4:  Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Did not need instructor guidance on how to work with the endpoints.

### Work

I have completed the following projects in Module 3.

### Weather App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

In this project we used react/redux with a live api data. The first api we're using is Geolocation and the second is OpenWeatherMap. The main goals for this project was to retrieve and display forecast data, determine current weather from your current geolocation, and save pinned cities to display their forecast.

* Spec Adherence: 4
* Redux:4
* Routing: 3
* JS: 4
* Testing: 2
* Workflow: 3

#### Feedback from Brittany
Comments: liked our handleSubmit function and how the functionality and state were kept in the component, good prioritizing with having things work with components first before breaking out into containers, have containers only return the component or actionCreator that is needed and not the whole state, start testing with reducers and actions rather than components first, start with one reducer file and then break out into separate files, make more use of Github tools

### Remember

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/1606-remember-3)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-3)

In this project we used ember. The specifications of this project was to build a list of reminders with functionality like add, edit, revert back to the original reminder, delete, search and sort. This project was also a lesson on good practices with github, making detailed pull requests, and closing issues.

### Local App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/local)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.htmll)

In this project I used react, react-router4, redux, firebase, enzyme, and jest for testing. This project targets best places to eat from a local's perspective for anyone that just moved to Denver. I eventually want to add hiking trails but my MVP right now is being able to add a recommendation, retrieve and render data from the FourSquare API.

#### Reflection on Gear Up
##### Vote
* [markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up did not focus on one's political views or opinions. It simply asks us our attitude on voting or not voting. Being a US citizen, are we obligated to participate in the US electoral system?

##### Introverts/Extroverts
* [markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up focused on introverts and extroverts in work group settings. Are there any strengths and weaknesses to both sides that will leverage then in future projects?

##### Resilience
* [markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up focuses out being more resilience and how to train our body and mind to succeed in a high-fulfillment technical career. Turing trains us from the every beginning with its fast pace program and teaching structure. We overcome stressors every week and its how we overcome them to sustain a high level of performance in our programming careers.


### My App Pitch
Have you ever gone on vacation and asked any local in that area what their favorite place to eat was? They usually turn out amazing right. What if there was an app that already did that for you. Yeah foursquare or yelp already does that but they give you recommendations based on popularity reviews. This app lets anyone suggest a recommendation but still gives you all the necessities to decide for yourself. It's only restaurants right now but in the near future hiking trails are coming along.


### Job Search Strategies
* Daily Goals: I would like to at least research 2-3 companies and figure out if they're hiring and the details about those companies. Also practice code wars.
* Weekly Goals: I would like to send out my resume to at least 3-4 companies. Also possibly attend 1-2 meet ups and network a little more in person.
* Monthly Goals: Reflect and review which companies I already applied to or talked to and build that resilience.

### Giving Feedback
## Weather App: Casey Metz
This was the first time working with Casey and it was great. I applaud his organizational skills when it came to starting this project. He advised taking the DTR to another level and have a mid project assessment. By doing that I think it benefitted everyone in the group because it was a time to reflect on how the project was coming along and if each of our personal goals were getting accomplished. I haven’t experience that in any of my other group projects and I thought it was a great idea. I know Casey was nervous in the beginning of the project but his easygoing attitude and willingness to communicate and contribute helped us pull off this project the night before it was due. I wish I had a critique for you but I don’t.

## Weather App: Kirsten Swanson
Kirsten and I worked on our Weather App together along with Adam and Casey. This was the first time we’ve collaborated on a project and Kirsten was super accommodating and calm when I’m stressed out and nothing is working. I feel like we accomplished a lot together by just pairing and tackling small bits of the project. She is a willing communicator, and isn’t afraid to take initiative and drive when everyone is stuck. I learned a lot from her and would gladly pair with her on future projects.

## Weather App: Adam Bernard
It was great working with Adam again just because I feel like I know what he’s thinking when we’re bouncing ideas off to each other. Since we had a bigger group for this project he took the initiative to do research on the next part. Adam was our mister docs when it came to react-redux. He understood the global sense of it and my only critique for you is to just try implementing the docs even if the syntax may mess you up occasionally. Adam came through towards the end of the project and helped us render the 5 day 3 hours forecast.

## Remember: Pete Springer
Pete and I work on our Remember ember project together. This was the first time we messed with ember and we struggled in the beginning because of all of the black magic happening. We eventually figured it out and it’s great working with Pete because he’s always down to try any solution until we get the right answer. I appreciate him being patient and a good listener when I struggling and going down a rabbit hole.


### Being a Community Member

### Feedback
## Feedback from Casey Metz
Paul was great to work with. He's patient and a good listener, and very easygoing. The only suggestion I can think of would be to take on more active leadership in his projects, working to include all his group-mates and drive the project forward. I think his easygoing manner would make him good at that. But he seems to be right where he needs to be, asking for advice when he needs it, and giving out help in a very non-condescending manner.

## Feedback from Kirsten Swanson
his was a tough project, but from the start to finish of the project I feel like you were a huge contributor in our group overcoming large barriers. Getting the dummy data to render was huge and really boosted our group’s moral. Also together we were able to get the zip code forecast to render and that was a hurdle in our project as well. Great job with utilizing your dev tools, I think being able to effectively use them contributed a lot to the success of our project, but it also taught me how to make better use of them. It seemed like we paired on a lot of stuff with the Router and Redux and I think our workflow of bouncing ideas off of each other eventually got us to solve the problems. My only critique for you is to reach out sooner to your group members or instructors when you’re not able to figure something out after it’s been over half an hour to an hour. Lastly, you really demonstrated your drive and determination to accomplish as much as we could by putting in multiple late nights, and spending many hours reading documentation and working through tutorials. I thoroughly enjoyed working with you and look forward to more collaborative work together!

## Feedback from Adam Bernard
 It was great working with Paul again on this project and he did great at making sure we were splitting up the project to get things completed.  He was also great at making sure he was helping out everyone in the group complete there parts.  If he had an opportunity it would be to take on parts himself and work through problems on his own as well as helping everyone else out.  In the end it was great that he helped ut by learning redux and helping instigate it and putting in the large amount of time needed on the last day to get redux working.
