# Paul Nguyen - M1 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I didn't have many goals for module 1. However, one of my main goals I felt I accomplish was learning the basics, and having a good foundation to build upon. I knew we were going to move fast in this program but I didn't expect everyone, including myself, to have a foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery in 6 weeks! When looking back I'm really proud of myself.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Feedback from Steve on the Assessment
* Good job on breaking down what needs to be accomplished and take them on in steps.
* Try to refactor the code so it is more readable for others. Creating variables definitely help. Try to name these variables based on what they're doing.
* Good job on using keyboard shortcuts.
* Good job on collaborating and vocalizing your thought process.

JS Styles: 3 - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

Progression/Completion: 3- Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

Workflow: 3 - Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

Collaboration: 3 - Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Work

I have completed the following projects in Module 1.

#### (Portfolio)

* [GitHub URL](http://07nguyenpaul.github.io/portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

This was our first project at Turing. This 6 week project was to design our portfolio site. It not only tested our creativity but focused on the basic foundations of HTML and CSS.

#### (Color Changer)

* [GitHub URL](http://07nguyenpaul.github.io/color-literate-enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

This project was our first single day project. The goal for this project was to generate a random color, !=white, that changes the background color of the screen. It only required 2 buttons, one randomizes the colors and one that resets the background color to white. The buttons had a unique specifications on styling. Not only did this project test us on our CSS but our JavaScript as well.

(evaluation comments) // Haven't receieved any comments on this project yet.

Functional: 3 - Application meets all of the layout expectations and has one key feature fully implemented with one key feature partially implemented OR meets all functional expectations and has partially implemented layout.

JS Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

HTML: 3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


## Team

### Projects

I have completed the following Team Projects in Module 1.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://07nguyenpaul.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first team project. We were required to use our knowledge in HTML and JavaScript to design a game that generates a random number between a default range or a range set by the user. We added some complexities as the game progressed. If the user guesses the number correctly the game increases and decreases the range by 10 just to make it a little more difficult.

#### Feedback from Steve
* Good job on completing all three phases.
* Needs refactoring.

Functional: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

JS Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Feedback from Peter Springer
Paul and I worked together on number guesser. I found Paul to be easy to work with. He was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. We both seemed to get a little hung up on syntax but I think that is expected on our first project. I would be happy to work with Paul again in the future.

#### (Bookmark List)

* [GitHub URL](https://mjvalade.github.io/bookmark-list/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In this project we mainly focused on testing our jquery skills. We created a program that receives 2 inputs, a title and URL. The code specifies that the user has to input a valid URL in order to save it to the list. The program has another feature that enables the user to highlight certain bookmarks and record whether it has been read or not. Also, it allows the user to remove bookmarks while updating the application that records read, unread, and total amount of bookmarks listed.  

#### Feedback from Steve
* Need to be refactored using jquery. There was a mixture of JavaScript and jQuery.
* Good job on completing phase four.
* Workflow on github looks great. Looks like you communicated well and created different branches while working.
* Need to indent and organize code for better readability.
* CSS looks great.

Functional: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

JS Style: 2 - Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

Workflow: 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML: 2.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

CSS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Feedback from MaryJane Valade
Paul and I seemed to work very well together. We were able to organize our thoughts and talk through each aspect of the project before diving into writing code. He was very accommodating to my more restricted schedule for pairing up outside class hours.

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://sikemausa.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project we learned about keeping 'server' and 'client' as separate entities. We used JSON and localStorage to store and regenerate ideas inside localStorage. We created a code to hold ideas inside of an array of objects with four attributes: an unique id, title, body and quality ranking. We also enabled a feature that lets the user edit any idea and it would update to their localStorage until they removed it. That unique id is hard coded to that specific idea, and we used it to update any changes made to it's title, body, or ranking quality. It was also used to find and display any idea that user is trying to find using the search bar.

#### Feedback from Louisa
* No major bugs and user is able to navigate effectively.
* Good job on workflow. Looks like you guy communicated well with each other.
* Couple issues on CSS, tiny details to look it. Forgot to add meta name for mobile screen CSS.

Spec Adherence: 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

JS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Feedback from Mike Sausa
Paul was great to work with, he was awesome at taking initiative and getting features started, and was very effective in knowing when we were stuck an asking for help. Our workflow and GitHub had some room for improvement, but overall Paul was great to work with, and pushed us through some tough stretches.

#### (Snake)

* [GitHub URL](https://kccrs.github.io/Snakes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For game time we decided to make Snake. We used jquery, mocha, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The goal was not only to design but test the implementations of our code. Everyone knows how the game works but there are several parts to designing the game. We first had to render a snake on a canvas and make it move. The next step was to generate food for the snake to eat, but generate it in different locations of the canvas that the snake does not occupy. Next we had to make the snake grew when the food was eaten. This was a the tricky part of the design because each segment of the snake has to follow the piece in front of it. If not, the snake wouldn't zig and zag. Lastly, we had to create code to end the game based on if the snake hits a wall or runs into itself.

#### Feedback from Louisa
* Game play is functional. You guys have the essential parts required for the snake game.
* All application tests are passing and you guys have all the necessary tests for snake.
* Could use some refactoring and cleaning up on CSS. The plane picture could be a little dimmer to enhance snake and food. Don't use hand written font, it's a no-no(doesn't look good).
* Had 100 commits, seemed that you guys worked well together.
* Had a couple complaints using JShint.
* Overall good job!

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs.

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

3 - Five or fewer complaints.

##### Feedback from Casey Cross
Paul makes an excellent teammate. I worked with him on creating a snake game for the Game Time project.  He has a very serene and pleasant demeanor, even when he is incredibly frustrated.  Thus he served as a calming influence for me during my times of frustration.  I think our skills and strengths complement each other very well.  We also had a great balance in sharing the workload.  My only advice would be for Paul to take more Pomodoro breaks to clear his head when stuck on a problem for a length of time.  I would happily pair with Paul again in the future!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

##### Number Guesser: Peter Springer
Pete and I worked together to create our first project in Turing. We created a number guesser game. Pete was great partner with teaching his understanding of github. We found multiple bugs in our code and his problem solving skills are amazing. I would definitely recommend Pete as a partner and I would gladly work with him again on future projects.

##### Bookmark List: MaryJane Valade
MaryJane and I worked together to create our bookmark list program. Even though we had different availability, we discussed that in our DTR and resolved it by meeting in the mornings before class. MaryJane was very easy to work with and she implemented pseudo coding which made it easier to structure our code. I would be happy to work with her on future projects!

##### Idea Box: Mike Sausa
Mike and I worked together to create our Idea Box program. Mike was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. The only problems we had was with github. My only suggestion is to keep working with it because github has several tricks to work efficiently. I would happily work with Mike on future projects.

##### Snake: Casey Cross
Casey and I worked together to create our first game, SNAKE ON A PLANE! :snake::airplane: She taught me more things about github that I did not know. She has a great work ethic and organizes her work well by creating multiple branches on github. Casey has a great eye at spotting errors and resolving them in an effective manner. We worked efficiently together and I am proud of what we created. I can’t wait to see what we create next in the near future!

### Soft Skills/ Protocol Requirement
#### DTR

Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

What are your learning goals for this project?
Our learning goals for this project is to implement multiple tests while designing our game.  These tests will validate the process of each section we accomplish in creating snake.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
We both like to work together when we have time, but also have divine and conquer at the end of the end to find and learn more about the next part we tackle.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
I try to vocalize my thought process and by saying it out loud my partner can tell me if it’s a good idea or how to change it to accomplish what we’re doing. I take feedback well, it’s a good learning experience if you can admit that you’re wrong or need help.

How would you describe your work style?
I like to sit down and work on as much as we can before we call it a day. This could be a bad thing sometimes cause breaks are needed to ease and clear the thought process.

What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Organizing what needs to be done and pseudo coding has worked well in previous projects. Poor communication has hurt in other projects.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
I need a quiet environment to perform efficiently. Less distractions are key for a productive work day.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
I can work until 6-7pm. After that I have to go home to let out the dog.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
I like to openly talk about what is the problem because if there is one it’s best to resolve it an effective manner and work productively.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
I don’t know if I have biggest strengths in this project beside my slight understanding of javascript. I feel like we’re both in the same position. I could use improvements in driving more, writing more code, to become more comfortable with different syntax.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
We want to use jshint, javascript, html, and css.

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Collaboration might help. We can each talk about our thought process of how we think we can accomplish this problem. Then collectively merge all ideas to see what works.

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
If all parties are satisfy with the end product. We can achieve this by everyone contributing.

### Notes

- Work on git workflow
- Take more breaks
- Very niiiiice

Goals for mod1 were mainly to learn basics, build a solid foundation. Feels he accomplished that. Assessment went well, solidly passed it. Staff agrees, ended the module solidly.

Looking back, refactoring as stood out as an important step to take in projects. Importance of naming, structure, etc.

IdeaBox pushed him the most. Localstorage was hard to get his head around, was a big learning experience.

Snake was hard, lots of unexpected steps that were needed.

Liked all the collaboration, mostly in the same space but some remote pairing.

Wants to be a bigger part of the community, didn’t join in as much this module but wants to more moving forward. Wants to work on starting posses

Staff: all student feedback about working with Paul is positive

### Outcome

PASS
