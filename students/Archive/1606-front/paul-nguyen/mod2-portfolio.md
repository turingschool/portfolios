# Paul Nguyen  - M2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
In module 2 I really wanted to get better at testing. I felt like we rushed through it at the end of module 1, and it was rough getting back to it in the beginning of module 2. Although it go better throughout the module, thanks to my amazing partners! Another goal I had was to try something out of my comfort zone instead of playing it safe. I feel like I accomplished that as well with CSS in our Pomodoro App and learning React Router in our Networking App.

### End of Module Assessment

Final Evaluation: Scrabble Student: Paul Instructor: Brenna Notes: Seemed out of his element. More hesitation than is ideal at this point in the module with basic React functions and syntax. Suggested finishing out the eval on his own for peace of mind.

Progression/Completion

2.5: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

JavaScript Style

2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

Collaboration

3: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Work

I have completed the following projects in Module 2.

### 4 Weeks of Fonts

* [GitHub URL](https://07nguyenpaul.github.io/7-days-of-fonts)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/seven-weeks-of-fonts.html)

Introducing how typography is a critical piece to web design. It's basic and it makes any site easy to read and understand but it can also enhance and express emotion of the content beyond simply conveying text. It add depth and richness to the webpage. This project also provided practice on our skills with CSS and making it responsive.

### Style Guide

* [GitHub URL](http://07nguyenpaul.github.io/style-guide-challenge)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/style-guide-challenges.html)

In this project we went back to the basics to enhance our skills with the simplest common layout structures, nav bars, tabbed information, accordion tabs, and footers. This project was designed to be a base template so that we can reder back to it so in the future we can build elements more quickly and consistently.

### Chatroom App

* [GitHub URL](http://07nguyenpaul.github.io/chat-room)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html)

This was our first project in module 2. We brought it back to the late 90s and created our own versions of aol AIM. This project was test-driven. We were suppose to emphasize unit and feature tests to drive our javascript. We also focused on user interface and functionality to make it a working chat application.

#### Feedback from Yung Jhun
* Application is usable but was missing phase 3 of project.
* HTML, JS, CSS was good. Could use a little refractoring but overall good job.
* Testing was good, showed unit and feature testing.
* Work flow was great, many commits and comments on github.

Specification Adherence
2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

User Interface
2.5 - interface shows effort, comps had an effective layout that wasn't completed in execution. Good starting point, needs fine tuning.

HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing
3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Design

2.5 - needs polish, didn't get through implementation of comps.

### Pomodoro App

* [GitHub URL](http://bretthev.github.io/tier-one-timer-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

(description)
In the tier 2 project we had the choice of either creating a pomodore app, weather app, or an address book app. We decided to make a pomodoro app because we saw how useful it would be in the future. This project was a great way to remind ourselves to take breaks. It allowed the user to use the default work time of 25 minutes or create their own. It also gave them the option of a default break time or creating their own. It also alerted the user with a sound (in our case a fart noise) every 5 seconds counting down from 20 seconds. We were also responsible for making it responsive.

#### Feedback from Yung Jhun and Louisa
* CSS/SCSS looks good but it was hard to navigate on what to do. Took risk on learning something new on CSS.
* Testing was good, had unit/feature tests working.
* HTML/Javascript was clean, broke up functions.
* Work flow was good, had many commits and communicated well.

Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. -->

User Interface
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

HTML
4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

CSS/Sass Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

Note: good job investigating ways to use CSS, dove into :before and :after and animations. needs some tidying.

JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows… 4 - Zero complaints

Design
2.75 - needs some polish, there are good instincts and direction that flushed out in a more complete way.

)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

Tier Two Projects: Choose wisely. You are in charge of your own fun.

A Fancy List
A Smart Budget
A Nimble Networker

This was our first project with react. Our goal for this project was to design it using mobile-first approach, be assessible and be test-driven. The minimum specification allows the user to record a name, company, email, phone number, and social media URL. Also, ideally add a picture (in our case a gravatar) and toggle on/off to indicate that the contact needs to be followed up.

#### Feedback from Yung Jhun and Bree
* Application was missing one specification, not fully being shipable.
* Styling was good, it was responsive but could change the bright yellow color as follow up.
* Took risk with learning react router and implementing it well.

notes:

pumped the group took risks
production was buggy

Specification Adherence
2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

Risk Taking and Creativity
3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

Design
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### Shoot the Breeze (Chatroom App in React)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Firebase] (https://shootthebreeze-559ba.firebaseapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

The goal for this project was to familiarize yourself with react. The goal was to break apart components and test using Enzyme. The application must use Firebase to store and deploy messages and webpack to build tools. Styling layout was given to us, but we had to make it responsive.

#### Feedback from Brenna and Louisa
* Had MVP and like how we had state and dumb components split up.
* Be careful about nesting CSS, but it's clean and organized into separate files.
* JavaScript could be refractor a bit, had some repetitive code but not much.
* Enzyme testing looks nice, like that we implemented filter and sort testing.
* Work flow looks good. Recommendation for next project was to be more descriptive in the commits. It will help if something goes wrong.

Rubric Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Component Architecture
4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

CSS/Sass Style
4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## Chatroom App: Casey Cross
Casey and I worked on our Tier 1 project, Chatroom App. This was our second project together. It always amazing working with her because she super accommodating and helpful when I’m banging my head against a wall. I appreciate her meticulous attention to detail and admire her willingness to take the lead when she has an idea. I feel like our brains are in sync now and I can’t wait for our third project together.

## Chatroom App: Brett Hevia
Brett and I worked on our Pomodoro app project. He was accommodating and patient when I didn’t understand some of the logic. He’s great at teaching and breaking down situations into smaller accomplishable sections. I definitely had fun creating fart noises and learned a lot being partners with Brett. I would work with Brett again on future projects.

## Chatroom App: Adam Bernard
Adam and I worked on our Networking App in module 2. This was the first time I was paired up with Adam and it was our first project with a group of 3. He was extremely accommodating when I didn’t understand a the logic behind something. Adam also set aside time to help me understand flexbox a little better. I learned a lot from this group and I especially appreciate Adam’s help. He also encouraged our group to step outside of our comfort zone and experiment with react routers and in the end it turned out great.

## Chatroom App: Ben Godfrey
Ben and I worked on our Networking App in module 2. This was the first time I was paired up with Ben and it was our first project with a group of 3. Our DTR are awesome, we set our goals that we wanted to accomplish and I believe we did everything we wanted to do. He’s an active communicator and was willing to stop and explain his thought process before we moved on to the next challenge. It was amazing to see him enter the matrix and knock out problems after problems in react. He definitely was seeing code. I would definitely work with him again and can’t wait to see what we create next.

## Chatroom App: MaryJane Valade
MaryJane and I worked on our last project of module 2 together, Chatroom App in React. This is our second project together and it’s right where we left off. She is super accommodating to my ideas even when they don’t work out.  And I admire her willingness to try every possible scenario  when we get stuck. She’s a active communicator and isn’t afraid to drive when it comes down to coding. It amazing to see how proficient she has become since the start of this program.

I worked with Paul on our lonely chatroom app.  Paul and i worked together on back to back projects, which I didn’t mind because he is easy to work with.  He has a great sense of humor and makes even stressful projects feel more manageable.  Paul and I often joke that we should be hired as a duo because we’ve learned to work together so well and our skills are evenly matched.

## Feedback from Brett Hevia
I worked with Paul on the Tier One project (Pomodoro app). I’m prone to bouts of stubbornness and tunnel-vision during projects, and Paul was super accommodating and relaxed when it came to indulging some of my whims. I definitely appreciated his go-with-the-flow vibe. He was a willing communicator and not afraid to take initiative/the lead when I was spinning my wheels or hitting a wall. Also he put fart noises in our project and thus will always have a special place in my heart.

## Feedback from Adam Bernard
This was the first time I was able to work with Paul on a project.  It went really well and Paul was a great help on throwing out ideas and helping us think outside the box.  I know he had some trouble figuring out React at first but made sure that he was vocal about it, so that it gave us an opportunity to explain things.  His opportunity on the project was most likely talking through more of what he didn’t understand by telling us what he thought was going on and we could explain it easier to him if he was lost.  Paul also was a huge help on our css and design and really wanted to spend time on making sure he got better at css while doing the project, which I think he did a great job.

## Feedback from Ben Godfrey
I had a great time working with Paul on our Networking App. To start off the project, he had a great approach to planning out the app, as well as making sure we set goals as a group to push ourselves. He continually showed improvement throughout the whole process, going from not knowing anything about react and firebase to helping solve some of our most difficult and complicated problems (as well as allowing us to get anything to deploy to firebase). He was also great to bounce ideas back and forth with. I actually think our group solved a majority of our problems because of Paul (knowingly or unknowingly) forcing us to brainstorm.

One area of opportunity for you Paul would be to communicate more of your ideas. I know we were approaching A LOT of new material with this project, but the only reason I was able to ‘plug into the matrix’ was because of you talking through things with me. Truly, I think 90% of your ideas were implemented into this project in some shape or form, but I feel like you were somewhat hesitant to throw your ideas out there which caused us to not have as many dope ideas implemented! Some of this may be attributed to Adam and I having very loud personalities, but I’d love to hear more from you in the future if we have the chance to work together again!

## Feedback from MaryJane Valade
I really enjoyed teaming up with you again on another project. You were always willing to try out any idea - even if we thought it wouldn’t work it was still helpful to rule it out and see what happened or what the error said - and sometimes things worked! Also, your skillful use of the debugger was key.
