# MaryJane Valade - M3 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

Entering Mod 3, I felt really comfortable in React and that my JS skills were finally improving. Then we starting working in Redux and I felt confused all over again. I really wanted to feel confident using React and Redux because it seems to be the way the industry is going for many projects lately so I tackled it for my personal project. I was also excited to learn Ember to add another tool to my tool box. I hope we can do a little more with it in Mod 4 to have more practice. I am also really looking forward to Mod 4 and all the new things we will learn and polish our skills to set out on our own.

This mod I felt that I really became aware of what the industry is looking like as we begin searching for jobs. I tried to reach out to people in my circle for job hunting advice and to talk through my interests and how they could fit with some local companies.

4 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them

##### Following Documentation
3 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Needed some instructor guidance to implement them correctly.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Personal Project

#### CO Kid Hikes

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/cokid-hikes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

I developed a website application to create hiking trails that are kid-friendly so users can keep track of trails they have done or want to do in the future. This project was basically an Idea Box but I also implemented various API calls. I found a user's geolocation and then used that to call a weather API to find the local weather. I also brought in the Google Maps API so that when a user makes a new trail they can drop a pin to note the trailhead's location.

#### Evaluation Comments
* Rename a few functions to be more specific.
* Advice about testing and setting up tests as soon as I set up each component.

#### Evaluation scores:
**Feature Delivery:**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Two paired projects: Weather Tracker and Remember

#### Weather Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

The weather app project was one of the rare times we worked in a group of three people rather than two so it was important to focus on workflow and code commits. This project forced us to learn a lot of things all at once between Redux, API calls, routing, etc. First we had to find a user's geolocation and then use that to find the local weather. The focus of the app was allowing a user to create a list of pinned or favorite cities and getting the current and extended forecast for those cities. This was the first time we implemented Redux with React and had to learn how to organize all our actions in order to pass state from the main store.

**Scores:**  
Specification Adherence  
4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.  

Redux Architecture  
4 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

Routing  
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

JS Style  
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing  
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

Workflow  
3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

#### Remember

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-5)
* [Original Assignment] ()

This was our first chance working with the JS framework Ember. This project was structured in more of a real-world work style with a focus on workflow by receiving and solving user stories, pushing code for PRs and code review before merging and moving on to the next issue. Our system of working together until we felt comfortable tackling issues on our own was productive and helped us better learn Ember. Then we were able to move at a faster pace by dividing issues and reviewing together before pushing up for instructor review.

**Scores:**
PASS - 9 completed user stories

* [Flower Exercise](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1D9FI4eOLMkbkZCSWlVS2liZTQ/view?usp=sharing)

These sessions were helpful as we begin job searching and need a game plan so we don't freak out. Giving us some things to think about as far as what types of environments and people we want to work with is valuable. I really enjoyed having David Rudder come speak to us about the job interview process. He definitely put some of my anxieties to rest and gave us some great information. The problem-solving/creativity session for our personal project was not helpful.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Project 1: Weather App (Pete)  
I enjoyed working on the weather app project with you. You always put things in perspective and are able to take the long view. When I got ahead of myself and came to you for help, you were able to slow me down to think about the first small thing I was trying to accomplish rather than my big problem.

Project 1: Weather App (Jeff)  
It was nice to work with you again on the weather app. This project forced us to learn a lot of things all at once between redux, API calls, routing, etc. Once you figured out how to make redux work I appreciated that you tried to explain it to us rather than just breaking apart the project to work on our own elements. Taking redux on your shoulders when we were struggling helped Pete and I work on the rest of the project.

Project 2: Ember Remember (Kirsten)  
I enjoyed working with you on learning a brand new framework in Ember. I feel like our system of working together until we felt comfortable tackling issues on our own was productive and helped us better learn Ember. The best thing I gained from working with you is that whenever i wanted to go ask for help you wouldn’t let me because you thought we could figure it out ourselves - and you were usually right. This has really helped me with my personal project.

### Being a Community Member

From Pete:  
Working on the weather app with you was a pleasure. You are a strong communicator which makes it easy and enjoyable to pair with you. One thing I think our group did well was rotating who was driving and navigating based on who understood the current issue being worked on. Doing this well shows that you value your partners learning just as much as your own. I would be happy to work together in the future.

From Jeff:  
MaryJane, I really enjoyed working with you and Pete on the Weather app project.  I thought we did a good job working through it together and I was really happy with how it turned out.  I think we did a good job working together to muddle our way through all the new concepts and then did an awesome job of working independently on several pieces at once to get a solid app out the door by the deadline.  I hope we get to work together again on another project!

From Kirsten:  
This was the first time that we’ve ever worked together and it was great working with you! I think we did a good job with evenly driving when we were working together. Additionally, we evenly split up work to independently work on the issues we received later on in the project. So with that being said, I would say our collaboration and communication was very fluid and we had excellent workflow. Whenever we got back together after dividing our work you always explained your code in great detail in a manner that was succinct and easy to follow. Nice job with refactoring the styling after we made the basic layout. I can definitely tell you have an eye for design and you’re really good at it! You did a great job reaching out to the instructors and your mentor when you felt lost and needed help. In relation to this, I think sometimes you would reach out too quickly before trying to figure out the solution. However, I think you were already aware of this because of your shout-out during Friday wrap-ups. Otherwise nice work on our first Ember project and way to “cherry pick!”

From Susi Irwin:  
I am so fortunate to have gotten to know MaryJane over the past 3 modules at Turing and cannot say enough amazing things about her. She is the epitome of what Turing strives for in its developers: strong, courageous, talented, passionate. She balances school while raising two children who adore her. She manages to assist other students in the Front End Program, offer guidance to any Back End students who reach out as well. She is hard working and it is extremely apparent how dedicated she is to success. She attends the Joan Clarke Society Tuesday meetings regularly and is always around for a chat if I need. Such a pleasure to be a part of her community.

### Playing a Part

* I met with Angela Lindow (1605-BE) to discuss setting up an after-hours event to bring together Turing students and spouses/partners to support each other through the Turing process. We are working with Allison to get out a survey and schedule a date.

* I've attened a few meetups and even spoke to people at them (that is a big deal for me). I've met with a couple people for coffee to talk about jobs and the industry and working on setting up more over break and early next mod.

* I come in early to get work done but also try and tidy up the Bank space when necessary, as well as help set up for Friday guest speakers.
