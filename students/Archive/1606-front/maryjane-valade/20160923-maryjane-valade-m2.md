### Areas of Emphasis

Entering Mod 2, I was nervous because I still did not feel very comfortable with JavaScript and wasn't sure how I could build on a shaky foundation. Little did I know things would escalate so quickly - Project 1 assigned on Day 1! We're at the grown-ups table now.

This mod I definitely became comfortable using build tools. I am very excited to get more experience with React, I feel like this is easier to wrap my head around and I have also seen my vanilla JS skills improve while using React. I am curious to learn about the other frameworks in the next two mods and see how they fit into the toolkit.

I enjoyed the style/CSS lessons and want to focus more on the UI/UX areas in the coming mods. I feel like I am getting a better handle on using Sass appropriately and am looking forward to more time to work on layouts.

### Giving Feedback

Project 1: ChatRoom (Jeff)  
I enjoyed working with you on our Parakeet Chatroom. I’m glad we decided early on to divide the duties by our weaknesses so we each could work to improve our skills. Each night we broke up the project elements to work on and then in the morning regrouped to refactor the code. You were great at guiding me through the JS I wrote and I appreciated the periodic checking in to make sure I was understanding the code overall.

Of course I wish we had time to revisit the styling since you had to do that at the very end of the project but I think you did a great job on little sleep. One comment I should have spoken up about is I wish you had vocalized your thoughts when trouble-shooting issues, it might have helped us talk out the issues we encountered (and ultimately solved!) but that is also a personal work style. Otherwise I’m really glad we were paired up to kick off Mod 2 and will be happy to work with you in the future.

Project 2: Pomodoro App (Casey M.)  
I really enjoyed working with you on the Pomodoro app, Casey, and I’m happy with how it turned out. Thank you for being patient with me and explaining the parts I didn’t understand. I appreciated your steady attitude when we encountered problems, especially at the end when the JS wasn’t working on real browsers. Looking forward to working with you on a future project.

Project 3: Networking App  
(Casey C.)  
I really enjoyed teaming up with you on this project. You were always willing to try out any idea - even if we thought it wouldn’t work it was still helpful to rule it out and see what happened. Thank you for cleaning up all the styles and helping me understand sass better. You were great at helping to keep us on track, even when one of our group members was a little out of it.

(David)  
I learned a lot working with you on this project. I appreciate that, even though you moved pretty fast through things, you took time to make sure we all understood what was going on. I think talking through the logic of everything is very helpful to keep the team on the same page and moving forward.

Project 4: Chatroom 2.0 (Paul)  
I really enjoyed teaming up with you again on another project. You were always willing to try out any idea - even if we thought it wouldn’t work it was still helpful to rule it out and see what happened and sometimes things worked! Also, your skillful use of the debugger was key.

### Being a Community Member

From Jeff:  
MaryJane, it was great working with you on lonely chat-room 1.0.  I thought we worked really well together and I’m happy with how our project came out.  I think we did a good job of dividing and conquering where we could and coming together to work out functionality issues where we needed to.  I probably could have done a better job of getting the styling in place a little earlier but it came out well and met the spec.  I thought you did great on building out the JavaScript and I thought it was great that you opted to take that on.  It was great to see your confidence grow throughout the project and at the end we put out a super clean code base!  I definitely look forward to working with you again on future projects!

From Casey M.:  
MaryJane was a great partner on the Pomodoro project. She helped keep us accountable for the things I felt lazy about (like testing), and took on the lion’s share of the styling. I appreciated her flexibility to work with me over screenhero in the evenings, and her encourage sharing the ‘driving’, which I consider very important. Her persistent drive to understand the code led to both of us learning a lot together. It would be a pleasure to work together again.

From Casey C.:  
I worked with MaryJane on a group project developing a networking app.  MaryJane is fantastic.  She is a hard worker and is great at seeking out help and advice whenever she feels she needs it.  She does not waste time and is very collaborative and resourceful.  MaryJane’s work ethic is inspiring, not only is she killing it on projects, she is also raising four year old twins. She has even resorted to going to Starbucks at night when her home internet went out and then sitting in her car outside after Starbucks closed working on a project so she could maintain internet connection.   That is dedication.

From David:  
You must have a blackbelt in time management.  I don’t understand how you could be so diligent with so many commitments going on outside of turing, but you are.  I think part of that is that you don’t waste time on things that don’t matter.  We would get off course, and after letting us (me?) wander aimlessly for 10 minutes you would tactfully get the group back on track.  I think we could have done a better job of keeping track of tasks and managing group work flow, but we were too busy scratching our heads with react and didn’t even know what our to-do’s were.  All in all, it was a pleasure working with you.

From Paul:  
MaryJane and I worked on our last project of module 2 together, Chatroom App in React. This is our second project together and it’s right where we left off. She is super accommodating to my ideas even when they don’t work out.  And I admire her willingness to try every possible scenario  when we get stuck. She’s a active communicator and isn’t afraid to drive when it comes down to coding. It amazing to see how proficient she has become since the start of this program.

### Playing a Part

* I continue to be active in the #joan_clarke_society channel and have only missed one Tuesday coffee. It's strange to start to feel like a veteran after only one Mod and now I am halfway through and people are looking to me for advice.

* I love participating in the #turingmoms and #parenturing channels. Doing this with kids is hard, I try to give support when I can and share what works for us so maybe one person will be a little less stressed.

* I try to fill out every survey with honest feedback to help make my instructors and Turing better at what they do. I generally feel that my observations are at least taken into consideration and I appreciate that.

* I'm starting to figure out Twitter! I went to my first Meetup!
