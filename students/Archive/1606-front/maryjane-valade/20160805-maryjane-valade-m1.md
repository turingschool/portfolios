### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into Turing I knew that I would learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that I could begin to make web applications and I was excited to see how all these languages could be applied. I had some familiarity with HTML and CSS from many years ago but did not know what to expect with Javascript. I did not have any specific goals beyond learning how to be in school again, how to be successful in the program, and to keep my mind open to all the new information I knew was to come.

As the weeks went on, I became determined to learn not only the concepts behind JS but how to write this new language. I also made an effort to apply my design skills towards a high level of styling projects when applicable. I am becoming more proficient with JS but still feel that I have a long way to go.

### Projects

We completed four paired projects this Module.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The goal of this project was to build a game where the user must guess a random number between 1 and 100.

**Scores:**  
Functional: 3  
Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.  
JS Style: 2.5  
Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.  


#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/bookmark-list)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

After learning some of the basics of jQuery, the goal of this project was to build a small online application that let users input websites they liked to create a bookmark list.

**Scores:**  
Functional: 4  
Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.  
JS Style: 2  
Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.  
Workflow: 3  
The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.  
HTML: 2.5  
Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually.  
CSS: 3  
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.  


#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Using Javascript, jQuery, localStorage, and good UX, we built a simple application for recording and archiving a user's ideas (good and bad alike).

**Scores:**  
Spec. Adherence: 3  
The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.  
User Interface: 3  
The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.  
JS Style: 3  
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.  
Workflow: 4  
The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.  


#### Game Time, Jr.

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/blakeworsley/surfs-up)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

The goal of this project was to use all the skills we've learned so far to build a simple game that was playable and looked good in the browser.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Project 1 feedback (Madison, Number Guesser):  
Madison is a very supportive teammate. We were learning how to do a Turing project at the same time as trying to figure out the current project so there was a large learning curve but I think we weathered it well together. She made a great attempt to stay organized and keep us on track. Sometimes she jumped around before finishing a task but usually recognized it and tried to come back to original task.


Project 2 feedback (Paul, Linked List):  
Paul and I seemed to work very well together. We were able to organize our thoughts and talk through each aspect of the project before diving into writing code. He was very accommodating to my more restricted schedule for pairing up outside class hours.


Project 3 feedback (Madison, Ideabox):  
As our second project together I felt that we worked really well as a team. We were much better at breaking the project up into tasks and Madison’s use of a Trello board was very helpful. Her grasp of JavaScript and making attempts at trouble-shooting when we ran into problems helped us when we got stuck. I think we got more comfortable asking for help sooner than on the last project but we were also able to ask better questions and be more directed in what exactly we needed help doing.

Project 4 feedback (Blake, Game Time):  
Blake and I both started this project with similar strengths and weaknesses so I wasn’t sure how that would balance out. It turned out to work really well because we focused a lot of our energies on the JS to make sure we really understood what everything was doing. Blake seemed to pick up some of the JS faster than I but he was great and making sure that I understood what was going on. We made lists to keep ourselves organized - which helped us get back on track when we jumped around. I really enjoyed working with Blake, his enthusiasm made this a great project.

### Being a Community Member

From Paul:  
MaryJane and I worked together to create our bookmark list program. Even though we had different availability, we discussed that in our DTR and resolved it by meeting in the mornings before class. MaryJane was very easy to work with and she implemented pseudo coding which made it easier to structure our code. I would be happy to work with her on future projects!

From Madison:  
MaryJane it was such a great experience getting the opportunity to grow with you. I felt that our progression between the two projects exemplified our learning throughout Turing. We started out with a somewhat rocky as we both absorbed the abundance of information presented to us in the initial weeks at Turing. We pulled through our first project and continued to improve thereafter. I am thankful that I got to experience your growth in project management, development and confidence. I am not only admirable of your CSS skills but also your persistence to understand complex topics. I hope that you continue to cultivate your confidence in coding and leadership through future projects. I felt that we balanced each other well and helped to strengthen the skills of one another brought to the table.

From Blake:  
I really had a wonderful time working with you on the project. I think we both came at it with similar strengths and worked very well to complete the project together. I appreciated you suggesting that we work on the station together because it allowed us to collaborate effectively. I really don't have much constructive criticism to give other than to keep practicing the concepts which is obviously something that both of us need to work on as we are 6 weeks into the program. Otherwise great job and I look forward to working again!

### Playing a Part

* I have been to many of the Joan Clarke Society morning coffees and the Slack channel, and I enjoy meeting women from the various Mods and alumni. It has been interesting getting to know the other women and what they are working on. In turn they have been really interested to hear what the FE program is like and what we are working on.

* I am a part of the #turingmoms Slack channel and that has been a big help as I navigate through this first Mod. Sometimes I deliberately avoid mentioning my kids to classmates because I don't want to only be seen as a mom or have people think I want any exceptions made for me, but in this group I can be free to vent with women who understand the difficulties. Now that I have one Mod under my belt I am happy to share how my family makes it work with fellow moms and potential students.

* I try to help my classmates with questions whenever I can and I always end up learning something at the same time.

* I hope next Mod I will be better settled into the routine and be able to represent Turing at other Meet-ups around the community.
