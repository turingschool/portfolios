# MaryJane Valade - M4 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

Entering Mod 4 I felt really good. I finally seemed to reach the point everyone talks about at Turing - being ok with not knowing everything. I still struggled with code challenges but I knew I could - given enough time - figure out anything new. Whether that translates to a job remains to be seen.

I really enjoyed the React Native project. I seemed to pick it up easily and it was fun to think about an application solely for a mobile user.

Now that my time is my own I plan to practice my JS fundamentals and work through code challenges so that my self-confidence with logic problems doesn't hold me back in tech interviews.

## Group Work & Projects
### Projects

#### Jet Fuel (URL shortener)
* Score: 67/100
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/url-shortener)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

For this project we built a URL shortener service. The application allowed users to provide long, ugly URLs and create shortened URLs through the website. To get the website up and running we created an express server to make post/get calls.

#### Imposter Syndrome (Electron/recipes)
* Score: 158/175
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/electron-recipes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

This project covered the range of possibilities during the course of development. The goal was to create a recipe tracking desktop application built in Electron. We began building the project in Ember with the SQLite database. We were on the right track but eventually hit a wall with the DB. At the final hour we burned it down and started over in a different format and were able to build a serviceable application. This project stretched my limits and forced me to grow as a developer.

#### Curiously Native (NASA API)
* Score: 160/175
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/native_nasa)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/curiously-native.html)

This was my first experience with React Native and I really enjoyed the challenge. We made a call to NASA's meteorite API and visualized the data returned.


#### Capstone (Wellness Challenge)
* Score: 290/325
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/wellness-challenge)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

The capstone project was a three person group that gave me a chance to work with a brand new partner and also someone I haven't worked with since Mod 1. After so many paired projects it was nice to practice working in a larger group, even if it was only increase by one extra person. The dynamic changed and we were able to break up features a lot easier because no one person was working alone on anything. We implemented a brand new database we had never tried before as well as used the Ember framework, which we were all rusty on. It was definitely a challenge but I think we created a solid application that someone else can continue to polish.

## Professional Skills

### Top three priorities in the job search and why
* Location  
I cannot move so need to search in metro Denver/Boulder area. I've done the long commute before and that does not make for a good quality of life.
* Supportive Team  
I want to be challenged to learn new things and push myself as a new developer but I want to have a supportive team around me to help in this development.
* Excited about product/service  
I know that I need to be excited about the product or service that the company provides in order to do my best work.

### Action plan for how to overcome perceived barriers to the job search
One of my greatest anxieties is that I am a career changer and feel older than a lot of other people in the junior dev realm. But to overcome this I can emphasize that I have experience in the working world as a project manager and understand how to work towards hard deadlines.

## Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Jet Fuel/Node App (URL shortener)
David:  
I enjoyed working on the Node app with you. You vocalize your thought process very well while working and are open to discussion. You definitely had a handle on the process faster than I did but you always made sure to talk me through the code and work through the server-side. That became more valuable when I used this server in my final assessment as well. One comment for future pairing is to always use a larger monitor so partners don’t feel like they have to look over your shoulder to your laptop screen.

#### Imposter Syndrom/Electron (Recipes)
Casey:   
If ever there was someone to burn down a project with I’m glad it was with you! I think we gave our Ember/Knex/SQLite/Electron app a valiant try and we would have succeeded if not for the database hangup. I’m glad we put in the effort to relearn Ember again but it was unfortunate we couldn’t put more time into the fun Electron things. I really enjoyed working with you and you were always able to keep me from getting ahead of myself. Making the decision to start over two days before the project was due took courage but was the right thing to do and at least we produced a workable app. I don’t think we could have succeeded in such a short time without a good workflow and partnership.

#### Curiously Native (Native NASA)
Kyle:  
I enjoyed working with you to learn React Native. It was a fun project to be completely mobile and we both seemed to pick up the syntax pretty quickly. I think it worked well - once we had the basic architecture set up - to break up the rest into sections. I was impressed with how quickly the bulk of the project was finished, which gave us more time to work on the data visualizations and refactoring the code.

#### Capstone (Wellness Challenge)
Madison:  
After a long break from working together it was nice to finish out school as part of a team. I realized we book-ended Turing by doing our first and last projects together! You made great strides for the wellness project by helping Adam with the database and tackling the data visualizations. Even if the charts didn’t quite work out due to deadlines they still added to the overall UX of the application. I am amazed at your drive and determination to learn “all the things” at such a relatively young age. You have already amassed a variety of life experiences that I see you putting to use every day and I will be excited to see where the road takes you.

Adam:  
It was fun working with you for the first time. I’m glad you pushed to tackle a legit database rather than roll with firebase again because I think it made for a better application. You made great strides for the project by hooking up the DB and figuring out the deployment issues. Your encouragement and good-heartedness added to the team and helped during the difficult times.

#### Classmate
Susi Irwin  
I couldn’t be more proud of Susi for her perseverance to finish the program even though she already scored a job. She is driven to succeed for herself and her family. Her enthusiasm seems to rub off on those around her and she has become a great friend. I wish we could have done a project together, combining our FE and BE skills.

### Being a Community Member

From David:  
Working with Mary-Jane is always a pleasure.  Not only does she make you feel inadequate by beating you into school everyday despite the longest commute and children at home, but she also maintains incredible focus in the time she is there in working through problems.  I was impressed at her willingness to ask questions, particularly of teachers, when we were stuck.  She has a good sense of when struggling with a problem is constructive, and when it becomes a waste of time.  Regarding code, we were both struggling through the specifics of express, but were able to move forward together by talking through issues.  Mary Jane is a joy to work with and I hope to have the opportunity again in the future!

From Casey:  
I worked with MaryJane for the second time during our Imposter Syndrome project.  We challenged ourselves to implement an Electron app in Ember with SQLite.  MaryJane is always 100% dedicated to the task at hand and does not give up even in the face of seemingly insurmountable struggles.  We had a very difficult issue in our project that caused us to reach out to a number of senior developers including members of Ember’s development team.  MaryJane persevered, even when we decided to burn the whole project down in the 11th hour and rebuild it from scratch using jQuery.  I would work with MaryJane again any day.  She is a kind and hardworking teammate.

From Kyle:  
I enjoyed our first time working together MaryJane! I feel this project was one of those rare times where anything we approached worked on the first try. I also feel like we both took steps forward in being able to manipulate data coming from an API as well as furthering our understanding of Redux. You've turned into one hell of a programmer & I look forward to seeing what you accomplish outside of Turing.

From Madison:  
Feedback:  I always love working with you. It has been such a joy to see how we have both grown over our time at Turing as developers. We can actually write code now! You have an amazing ability to step back and understand the problem at hand. The only feedback I have is that at times, when you encountered blocks, you devalued your ability. Stick with it girl! You are smart and capable. With a bit of research I felt that you could have figured it out. Best of luck with your future career as a developer! You are going to kick butt!

From Susi Irwin:  
I am so fortunate to have gotten to know MaryJane over the past 3 modules at Turing and cannot say enough amazing things about her. She is the epitome of what Turing strives for in its developers: strong, courageous, talented, passionate. She balances school while raising two children who adore her. She manages to assist other students in the Front End Program, offer guidance to any Back End students who reach out as well. She is hard working and it is extremely apparent how dedicated she is to success. She attends the Joan Clarke Society Tuesday meetings regularly and is always around for a chat if I need. Such a pleasure to be a part of her community.

### Playing a Part

* This mod I participated in my first hack-a-thon and the first that Turing hosted. It was a lot of fun to work on a joint FE/BE team. Our group finished in the top 3 and represented the front-end program in the community.

* I've gone to all the Tuesday morning Joan Clark Society (women's group) coffee events and participate in the Slack channels for JCS and especially Parenturing to help fell parents navigate through the difficulties of school and family life.

* I took over the Turing Twitter feed for a day to show what life is like in FE Mod4.
