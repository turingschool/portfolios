# Kirsten Swanson - M1 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

During Module One I was determined to become solid with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I wanted to keep up with the material and try to expand my knowledge of concepts outside of class. Due to time constraints with completing projects I wasn’t really able to study concepts more in depth outside of class, but I would refactor my code after reviewing ways to clean it up. However, I was able to start a technical blog and a Twitter account. Furthermore, I was driven to push myself to try my hardest on projects and if time allowed to try extensions and not settling for less. Despite losing hours of sleep over this I wanted to challenge myself.

### End of Module Assessment

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

###### Project Description:
The user guesses a random generated number between 0-100. The range is 0-100 by default, but the user can enter their own interval range. The game will give the player hints if their guess is too low or too high. Once the player guesses correctly, they're notified that they’re correct and the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10 to make the game more difficult.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Create different unique classes and ids, so you can use specific ones when targeting elements whether you’re in JavaScript or CSS. Make better naming conventions in our functions, so people reviewing the code will have a better idea what the function actually does. Instead of calling a function that has multiple statements repeatedly, create a function that encompasses all those statements, so you only call one function.

###### Evaluation Scores:  
Functional: 4 <br> JS Style: 3

Evaluators: Louisa & Julian

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/favorite-bookmarks)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

###### Project Description:
The user stores their bookmarked website by inputting the title and URL of that website. The user’s URL will be validated before the bookmark can be saved on the website page.
Once the validated input is submitted it appears on the website page. The bookmark can be marked as read, removed from the list, or all read bookmarks can be removed at the same time.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Change size of input fields for mobile devices in the media query. Use ES6 string interpolation instead of concatenation. Refactor jQuery so that all global variables are at the top of your script and functions are organized in relation to their behavior. Like counter functions are next to each other and click functions are grouped together.

#### Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

###### Project Description:
Created two buttons. One will set the background color of the page to a random color. The other button will reset the background page color to the default white color.

#### Ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

###### Project Description:
Ideabox is an application that allows a user to record and archive their ideas. The user inputs the title of their idea followed by its description into the designated input areas. Once the user clicks the 'save' button the idea is stored locally on their computer. If they refresh the browser their idea will remain on the page. The user can rank or delete their idea from the page. Also the user can sort their ideas based on their ranking.

###### Evaluation Comments:
No feedback provided for improvement with our jQuery but recommended to make a typography  section in CSS to group elements with the same font and color together. Additionally, styling the sort button like the submit button with the same color and straight border was suggested.

###### Evaluation Scores:

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/game-time-snake/tree/master)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

###### Project Description:
Built a snake game that is playable in the browser. Used object oriented programming and arrays to create the snake and the world(game logic and functionality) it lives in. HTML5 Canvas was used to render the snake onto the page. Performed unit tests throughout the building of the game with Mocha and Chai assertions.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Create variables instead of passing in numbers. Move everything related to the snake into the snake constructor. Remove comments and instead make better function names. Create new file with game logic. Make prototypes with only one function, so that unit testing on each function can be completed.

#### Personal Portfolio Website

* [GitHub URL](https://swanie21.github.io/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

###### Project Description:
A website that represents our personal brand and reflects us as an individual. Our website needs to be organized neatly, easy to navigate, and written with DRY CSS and semantic HTML. It should include a primary navigation, footer, biography, education, previous work experiences, projects, and contact information.

### Giving Feedback

Adam: For our first module project I think we did a fine job! I think we could have worked on the styling more, but we were more focused on completing the functionality. I apologize for implementing the bright retro colors. Great recommendation with including the instructions. Since the game became more complicated with the user inputting their own range the instructions were a good idea. Also in relation to the range increasing, nice work in finding out how to increase the range with discovering how to use ‘min’ and ‘max’  variables. Since this was our first rodeo with using Github I think we learned the rhythm of committing, but we should have been making branches and then merging onto the master. Overall, we had great teamwork for the first project.

Andy: We pushed through this project to make it work! Once you had your mindset on completing a specific task you were driven to solve it. One time you were fixated on some functionality that wasn't required, but I praise you for trying to make it the most user efficient. When you didn’t understand something you did a great job using your resources to find the solutions. You stayed organized with the project by creating a waffle.io and I apologize for not using it. Sometimes I think I should have explained myself more especially with the CSS flexbox for you to understand it better. Don’t be afraid to stop your partner to ask for an explanation. I enjoyed our lunch together and learning about you as a person outside of school. In conclusion, it was great working with you and thanks for being so supportive.

Jeff: You were a fantastic partner! Our workflow together was smooth and consistent. You were on top of your commits with committing small changes, which helped me to commit more frequently. I think it was a smart idea to focus on the areas that were our weaknesses and that played out well for both of us strengthening our weaker points. Then it was beneficial refactoring and reviewing each other’s work. You were a great communicator when I didn’t understand some JS/jQuery methods and would methodically explain things to me in a manner that was easy to digest. Your skills with debugging helped me to understand how to use the ‘debugger’ effectively. All in all, it was a pleasure working with you, especially since we seemed to balance each other out.

Madison: We made the snake grow! What a fun roller coaster that project was with you. Whenever I was lost with the unshifting and popping of the snake you did a thorough job explaining it. Although at times you were moving so quickly that I couldn't understand your thinking sometimes. Your diagrams of the logic of the game were great references to help in constructing the game. Whenever we needed help you were resourceful and didn't hesitate to reach out. And when you needed assistance with CSS I'm glad you asked me for help. Thank you for working around my schedule with moving and for having the drive you did to complete the project after many late nights together. Overall, our work styles meshed great together and you were a wonderful partner!  

### Being a Community Member

For Number Guesser we worked well together and I was glad that we talked about how we worked ahead of the project, so that we knew what to expect. I thought it was great that you took charge with the formation of the base game while I was looking into the later phases. I actually think we both did well with github considering we didn’t know about branches yet. If we had an opportunity, we definitely could have spend more time on it’s appearance, but with the time making functionality work was still spent well. Another opportunity you had was making sure you aren’t afraid to speak up more. You had some great ideas that I felt were awesome and with more confidence in these decisions you could have a lot of impact on the final project. Otherwise It was a great experience working together and I think we meshed well and really focused on getting the project fully completed.

I enjoyed working with Kirsten so much! Her ability to be patient and listen to my thoughts and concerns helped me feel confident and effective. In moments of stress she would gracefully guide my efforts back to the project. Her calm and determination kept us productive when most people would have walked away. I learned more than I know in the short time we worked together. I could have asked more questions, and will hence forth. I learned that I can design ​and code with finesse because I saw Kirsten do it everyday we worked together. Thanks Kirsten!

It was great working with you and I thought we worked really well together! I think it was great that you wanted to take on the js/jquery for the project and strengthen your skills.Keep looking for areas that you feel you need improvement on and forcing yourself to take those on. Also I thought it was great that if there was a piece of code you didn’t understand you made sure that we paused and went over it until you fully understood it.  Don’t be afraid to pause or stop your partner so you can go over any code you don’t understand! Keep doing what you’re doing.

Kirsten, I really enjoyed working with you on this project. I felt that our constant collaboration was very beneficial to the outcome of the game. You are very strong in your attention to detail and thoughtfulness about a methodology and functionality of the game. I think you did a great job deliberately taking a piece of the project and pushing forward to completion. Constructively I think that that it would be beneficial to test your hypotheses quicker vs over thinking them. I really valued our time working together and the level of camaraderie we had during the process.

### Playing a Part

On July 15th, I taught a student-led session on CSS transitions and gradients. For that lesson I created a gist with Codepen examples that the other students could experiment with.

On July 11th and July 24th I wrote technical blog posts on Medium.
[Technical Blog](https://medium.com/@kswanie21)

On July 12th, I contacted the Colorado Center for the Blind to be partners for our accessibility testing for the Accessibility posse group. Heard back from them that they would be interested, but still waiting to coordinate an actual game plan.

Hilary Lewis interviewed me about Turing and now she has been accepted and is in the 1608 cohort.

### Notes
coming into the program wanted to get fundamentals, with HTML CSS and JS. Wanted to work on project extensions whenever possible.

Needs to work on taking tiny steps as you work, rather than trying to build/solve the big problem instead of looking at each step you need to take to get there.

Staff: great community engagement, taking initiative to lead sessions, and be involved.

### Outcome
PASS
