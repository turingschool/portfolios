# Kirsten Swanson - M4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis
During Module 4 I was looking forward to learning new technologies with Electron, Websockets, and Progressive Web Applications. Additionally, this module I wanted to balance my schoolwork with my job hunting search. I wanted to make sure I put full effort into my school projects, yet still make enough time to research and apply for jobs.

### End of Module Assessment
The final assessment required making a persistent Grudge Bin in any framework of our choosing. The grudge list members needed to be stored in a server with an id, name, description of offense, and forgiven status.

### Projects  
I completed the following projects for module 4:  
1. jet-fuel
2. imposter-syndrome
3. curiously-native
4. capstone-project

### jet-fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

###### Project Description:
This application shortens urls. The user will input a url and will be provided a shortened link that will redirect them to the correct url they had input. The urls can be sorted by date as well as clicks. This app is configured with webpack and is using Express as the back-end.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Only have one root entry, shorten push function with destructuring, try to deploy with one server without using webpack

###### Evaluation Scores by Alex:
Spec adherence: 35 points  
User Interface: 5 points    
Testing: 8 points   
Javascript: 10 points   
Workflow: 10 points  
Bonus: 10 points (search and URL validator)  
Total: **78**


### imposter-syndrome

* [Personal repo](https://github.com/swanie21/change-of-scenery)
* [Turing repo](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

###### Project Description:
This Electron application sets your Mac OS desktop background with images from Unsplash. The app is built with a Vue.js framework that implements localStorage, axios requests, and AppleScript.

###### Evaluation comments:
Nice job with doing tests even though they weren’t part of the spec, instead of having a setTimeout for the picture to load perhaps there’s a different function to be called for when an image has been downloaded (this will solve the problem when you have bad internet connection and only half the image gets downloaded)

###### Evaluation Scores by Brittany:
User Interface: 10 points  
Risk Taking: 60 points  
Javascript: 40 points   
Workflow: 20 points  
Blog: 45 points  
Total: **175**

### curiously-native

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blakeworsley/BiggestSplash)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/curiously-native.html)

###### Project Description:
React Native application that scores photographers on Unsplash based on their ratio of total likes to total photos. This application implements React Redux, data visualizations with circle and bar graphs, and Auth0 authentication.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Make sure all the “console.logs” are removed, there should be a catch error if there are no results returned from the API call, large functions should be split out from the rendering, and submit button should have some feedback when pressed

###### Evaluation Scores by Alex:
Authentication: 10 points  
Immutable Redux: 18 points  
Visualizations: 20 points  
Javascript: 25 points  
User Interface: 9 points  
Risk Taking: 20 points  
Workflow: 20 points  
Blog: 45 points  
Total: **167**


### capstone-project-turing-fridays

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/turing-fridays)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

###### Project Description:
This application was built to help structure Friday schedules at Turing. Specifically, we aimed to replace Friday spike participation count in Slack to be monitored by this app. However, students can also be informed about the Gear Up session and the guest speaker through this app. This app is configured with Webpack to compile React and Firebase.

###### Evaluation Comments:
map of classrooms could include attendee count, visual cue for when spike is approved or pending aside from the color change(mark it with some approved stamp), indicate editable card, break out large function from rendering as well as large html rendering(make into a function and call it within the rendering), write out “approved” instead of “appr” when creating a spike, when testing focus on small unit tests

###### Evaluation Scores by Alex:
Production: 75 points  
JS style: 45 points  
User Interface: 38 points  
Risk Taking: 60 points  
Testing: 45 points  
Workflow: 50 points  
Total: **313**

## Community

### Gear Up
**December 2nd 2016**: Microaggressions
What are your takeaways from the microaggression articles?

I think many minority groups encounter microaggessions often and that people who make these microaggressions aren’t consciously aware that they’re offending someone. As an Asian female I feel like I’ve had people make micoraggressions towards me, but I don’t take it personally anymore. I think when I was younger I was quite offended, but have accepted that I’m different than others and people can either like me for who I am or not.

How does this information change or reinforce what you thought about the topic of microaggressions at the outset of this session?

Before learning about microaggressions and reading all the articles I didn’t realize this was a term. I would have classified this behavior as stereotyping.

What questions do you still have about this topic and how it relates to your life?

How do you respond to someone that makes a microaggression that is insulting to you? When I tell people I’m from Korea sometimes they ask if I’m from North Korea. I feel like they’re just trying to joke, but sometimes it upsets me. I’m not confrontational in the least, so it’s hard for me to express myself when something bothers me.

**December 9th 2016**: attended Brett’s Chrome Extension student led session

**December 16th 2016**: Missed Gear Up due to a job interview in Westminster (approved by Steve)

**December 22nd 2016**: attended Graham’s technical white-boarding prep

**January 6th 2017**: Grit
Describe a time at Turing where you demonstrated your grit.

In Module 1 when I was working on our game time project I was extremely frustrated, so much that it brought tears to my eyes and I was starting to feel convinced that I couldn't be a programmer. My grit was definitely under strain at this time, but I persevered and continued to finish the project. Making tiny baby steps were encouraging and motivated me to continue. Plus I was passionate about learning to program and I couldn't give up after such a large investment with my time and money.

When can grit be problematic?

Grit can be problematic when you become too stressed or burnt out from something. Everyone needs a break to recharge and not lose passion about something.

Mod 4 Grit Questions:
1. In Module 3 I really enjoyed working on our self-directed projects since I could really test my personal growth and measure my progress.
2. Looking into the future with my software developer career I can really see myself becoming passionate about seeing ideas coming to life and my role really contributing to the creation of this.


### Giving Feedback

##### Pete's Feedback:
This was the third time working together and I feel like we have our methodology of working together down, especially when we’re pairing. You’ve always been thorough with explaining your thought processes and then writing it in code. All the times we’ve worked together you have always had a flexible schedule and are willing to stay late, which makes working with you easy and our workflow go smoothly. It’s always great working with you and I know in the future you will be able to fit into any team and they will be lucky to have you as part of their team!

##### Jeff's Feedback:
This was our second time working together and just like last time you can always be counted on for functionality and figuring out the solution. Not to mention your design skills have greatly improved since Idea Box. Definitely a strength of yours is problem solving and solving problems in a methodic way instead of a “janky” way. After figuring out the problem you can always explain your logic in an easy and digestible manner. Together, with your logic and my design skills we make a good team. Wherever your future lands you I know you’re going to be an amazing asset and strong developer to any team!

##### Casey's Feedback:
I’m glad I finally got to work with Casey because otherwise I would have been sad if I hadn’t worked with her during my time at Turing. During our capstone project she kept our group very organized and accountable for Github issues, which made our workflow go smoothly. Her motivation to test is inspiring and will definitely benefit her in the future. We had 65 tests! She’s a master at resolving merge conflicts and not at all afraid to encounter them. Together we worked on styling and put together a really polished app. Casey is up for any challenge and ready to tackle whatever aspect of the project needs to be worked on, whether it’s testing, styling, or functionality. It was a pleasure working with Casey!

##### Blake's Feedback:
This was the first project that Blake and I worked together on and it was a lot of fun. We were really excited to pair since we had both worked in React Native with our personal projects and we are both passionate about design. It’s inspiring to watch the ideas that Blake creates in Sketch and to see his passion for design really come to life. Yes, Blake is known for having an eye for design, but he also possesses strong JavaScript skills and a resilient drive to solve any problem. I know that Blake has a bright future ahead of him because he is very talented in many ways, whether it’s design, creativity, logic, or determination, he will be a strong member to any team!

##### David's Feedback:
This was the first time that David and I have worked together. I was really excited to work with him because I had heard good things about pairing with him. His ability to quickly solve problems is inspiring and I hope I can someday think as quickly as him. I enjoyed watching him problem solve and listening to him explaining his logic. He acted as a leader at many times by organizing and facilitating tasks for our team. For example, during our snow day he coordinated a Slack meeting to make sure everyone was assigned a role. One of his many strengths is his sharing of knowledge by his willingness to help others. Not only does he do this with his team members, but I constantly see him offering his time to help others within the community. David has a bright future ahead of him and I’m excited to see where he lands after Turing!

### Being a Community Member

##### Pete's Feedback to me:
Kirsten and I have already worked together a few times at this point. Working with Kirsten has
always been a positive experience. I think one of Kirsten's strengths is pair programming. Whether driving or navigating she is always engaged and is a pleasure to collaborate with.

##### Jeff's Feedback to me:
Kirsten it was a lot of fun working with you on the capstone project. It wouldn't be as polished as it is without you. You always do a great job of thinking through all the UI edge cases and you do an excellent job of putting together a polished app! Our app would definitely be another basic idea box without your touches and expertise! It's been great working with you throughout the program!

##### Casey's Feedback to me:
This was the first time I had the chance to work with Kirsten on a project and I am very glad I finally got the opportunity. We both enjoy challenging ourselves in our UI, styling, and Sass skills and I’m always inspired by the techniques she learns and implements along the way. On this project she taught us a thing or two about implementing animations in React. She is always ready and willing to help out another teammate and she has a very calming presence, even when things get tough. I would work with Kirsten again in a heartbeat!

##### David's Feedback to me:
This was my first time working with Kirsten.  Her work ethic, persistence, and positivity brings together and motivates a team.  In other words, just by being herself she is a massive contribution to any team.  That can-do attitude carries over to her work where combined her attention to detail, she is efficient, clean,  and organized.  For a group project with pull requests requiring detailed reviews, she was always finding issues and bugs which would have caught up to us later. She always had a resource tucked away to save our group time, which I hope to emulate after seeing the time it saved.  If I could offer one piece of constructive feedback, it would be to try to use past repositories in the same way as documentation of how you did something previously.  Kirsten is the model team member and I would consider myself lucky if I get the opportunity to work with her again.

##### Blake's Feedback to me:
Kirsten - I have been looking forward to working with you since we started because of your obvious work ethic and excellent ability to output a great product. I really valued your time and support as we worked through this project. Your knowledge of both React Native and the Unsplash API surprised me and helped to make this project a success. You will be incredibly successful going forward with whichever company you choose to join. Thank You!


### Professional Development
1 paragraph describing your top 3 priorities in your first dev job and why

My three main priorities for my first developer job are opportunity for growth, collaborative environment with pairing, and emphasis on design. I thoroughly enjoy styling, so I’m seeking a position where I would be contributing more to the design aspect of the project. I want a collaborative environment where there is a strong support team. Lastly, I want to work in a company where I can continue to grow my skill set while I'm continuously learning. I don't want to be at a company where I'm bored and not able to explore new and exciting technologies.

1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

I'm nervous to take technical interviews because I'm concerned I might just freeze up or just look stupid because I don't know the answer. The only solution to this is to practice technical interview questions whether it's white-boarding in class or online exercises. I'm scared of rejection. I feel personally hurt when someone turns me down. I just need to get over this fear of rejection and put myself out there with sending in multiple applications. When applying to jobs I feel that I don't have enough experience that they're requesting. Once again I need to put myself out there and not assume the worst before I even apply. Lastly, I feel like I don't have a firm grasp on knowing specific industry terms. I just need to perform more research on these terms and remember them.
