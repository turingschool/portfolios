# Kirsten Swanson - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis
During Module 3 I wanted to become stronger at React since it seems to be highly demanded in the industry currently. Also I wanted to prove to myself that I can code and learn something new by tackling React Native for my individual project. By the end of this module I really wanted to come out feeling confident about my skill-set.

### Projects  
I completed the following projects for module 3:  
1. weather-tracker  
2. ember-remember  
3. birthday-tracker

#### weather-tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

###### Project Description:
This weather application required fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API. We used the Geolocation API to determine the current weather in our city. Additionally, the user could input a zip code into an input field and that weather from that city would be retrieved. The tools used on this project were React, React Router, React Redux and Sass.

###### Evaluation Comments:
Technical Review: liked our handleSubmit function and how the functionality and state were kept in the component, good prioritizing with having things work with components first before breaking out into containers, have containers only return the component or actionCreator that is needed and not the whole state, start testing with reducers and actions rather than components first, start with one reducer file and then break out into separate files, make more use of Github tools

###### Evaluation Scores:
Spec adherence: 4  
Redux: 4  
Routing: 3  
Testing: 2  
Javascript: 4  
Workflow: 3

#### Ember Remember

* [Personal repo](https://github.com/swanie21/1606-remember-5)
* [Turing repo](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-5)

###### Project Description:
In this project we learned Ember while collaborating with instructor workflow. We would receive an issue/feature that needed to be implemented and then we would have to make a PR for the instructors to merge. This PR needed to be merged in order to receive the next issue/feature. The app we created was a reminders list where you could add reminders. When you clicked on an individual reminder you could edit it or revert back the changes. From the reminders list you could search for specific reminders or delete them.

###### No Evaluations:
made it through issue #15, only needed to complete "sort" functionality

#### Birthday Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swanie21/birthday-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

###### Project Description:
This birthday tracker mobile app was made with Firebase and React Native with its native IOS features. It stores your close family and friends’ birthdays in Firebase. The user can add their contact’s name and birthday date with the datepicker. Additionally, the user can click on the avatar image to take a picture or select an image of their contact within their photo album in their iPhone. In the contact list the user can search for specific contacts. Also an individual contact can be clicked on to be edited or deleted. Additionally, this page allows the user to include notes for present ideas.

###### Personal Project Comments:
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with React Native to make a native mobile app. It was fun seeing all the different packages aside from the native features that could be implemented. It was a little risky to take on a framework that we haven't covered in class yet, but I wanted to teach myself something new. I didn't get to all the functionality that I wanted to get to, but I think I made a pretty solid MVP. Additional functionality that I would have liked to have added would have been Firebase Google auth, calendar push notifications, and a button that could be pressed to send a text message to the selected contact.

I initially struggled with the routing part, and that's when I reached out to Tino Espinoza (who was recommended by Tan as a React Native developer) to get his insight as to what navigator to use. After I switched from NavigatorIOS to react-native-router-flux I had an easier time with tabs and passing props down. Additionally, I had a hard time configuring the Firebase Google auth with React Native and ended-up not implementing it, but plan to work on that over the intermission. I thought React Native would have been really similar to React, but the set-up, syntax, and routing was completely different and was a new learning curve. The modular components with their state was the same, so the structure of the files was the same however.

### Gear Up

Gear Ups
October 7th  Gear Up: Vote your Conscience
This Gear Up focused on the upcoming elections. The topics covered were about whether or not to vote, how can you best be informed to make a smart vote, and what qualities make for a good leader. I chose the topic about voting. In our group discussion we talked about how people don’t vote due to lack of information about candidates or not thinking that their vote matters. Additionally, we conversed about how people may vote in fear in order to vote for the other candidate who they don’t necessarily support, but to prevent the other candidate from receiving a vote.

October 14th Gear Up: No Gear Up this week, only Spike (attended Redux lesson taught by Brett Hevia)

October 21st Gear Up: Introversion
During this Gear Up we watched a movie called “The Power of Introverts.” We discussed in a group whether we thought we were introverts or extroverts and what the advantages or disadvantages are to being one or the other. All of us in our group seemed to fall in the middle of extraversion and introversion. However, I do think we have people in our cohort who are more extraverted and they seem to participate more openly in discussions and delegate tasks more in group projects.

October 28th Gear Up: No Gear Up due to job Shadowing at Granicus.

November 4th Gear Up: Resilience
This Gear Up we read articles about Resilience. I was with two women from module 1 in the back-end and we had a very lively and engaging conversation. We talked about how Turing really teaches you to be resilient and how the community itself really aids in flourishing resilience due to all the support that other classmates offer. Resilience is definitely a valuable attribute that companies should seek because it shows that an individual is dependable and strong no mater what circumstances or conditions he or she is in.

### Giving Feedback

Adam: This was our third project together and I feel like we have an understanding of each other’s workflow. This time around however it seemed like we were applying frameworks that we weren’t so familiar with, but you did a good job with reading the documents and then explaining concepts to us. At times it seemed like you were explaining your ideas to approach solving our problems more than actually driving. Don’t be afraid to take control and just start typing even if you’re not sure if it’s going to break. Due to the group being four people our team dynamics changed for this project, but you did a nice job facilitating how people should split work up. This helped in making sure that we covered all aspects of our project in an organized way. However, at times it seemed like the group had a clash with ideas about how to approach Redux and better communication about your progress would have been more productive. Lastly, it seemed like you implemented my feedback from the last project when explaining the work done on the project, so good work with applying that. Nice job again!

Casey's: This was the first time working with you and it was thoroughly enjoyable. Way to step up with tackling fetching the API data. That showed great initiative in trying to figure out something new. Also you described your methodology of fetching the API very clearly to me as well as in the markdown that you created. I thought that was a great idea to include that in our project to show how the API data was being accessed. You did a fine job with making an effort to include everyone and holding our group together. The only critique I have for you is to have touched on more parts of the project like Sass or testing. I know that it was a priority with getting the Redux functionality working, but I know you had mentioned you would have liked to have worked on some Sass at the beginning, so perhaps to take a break from learning Redux you could have jumped into some styling. Otherwise I enjoyed observing your logical approach to solving problems and your team camaraderie.

Paul's: This was a tough project, but from the start to finish of the project I feel like you were a huge contributor in our group overcoming large barriers. Getting the dummy data to render was huge and really boosted our group’s moral. Also together we were able to get the zip code forecast to render and that was a hurdle in our project as well. Great job with utilizing your dev tools, I think being able to effectively use them contributed a lot to the success of our project, but it also taught me how to make better use of them. It seemed like we paired on a lot of stuff with the Router and Redux and I think our workflow of bouncing ideas off of each other eventually got us to solve the problems. My only critique for you is to reach out sooner to your group members or instructors when you’re not able to figure something out after it’s been over half an hour to an hour. Lastly, you really demonstrated your drive and determination to accomplish as much as we could by putting in multiple late nights, and spending many hours reading documentation and working through tutorials. I thoroughly enjoyed working with you and look forward to more collaborative work together!

MaryJane's: This was the first time that we’ve ever worked together and it was great working with you! I think we did a good job with evenly driving when we were working together. Additionally, we evenly split up work to independently work on the issues we received later on in the project. So with that being said, I would say our collaboration and communication was very fluid and we had excellent workflow. Whenever we got back together after dividing our work you always explained your code in great detail in a manner that was succinct and easy to follow. Nice job with refactoring the styling after we made the basic layout. I can definitely tell you have an eye for design and you’re really good at it! You did a great job reaching out to the instructors and your mentor when you felt lost and needed help. In relation to this, I think sometimes you would reach out too quickly before trying to figure out the solution. However, I think you were already aware of this because of your shout-out during Friday wrap-ups. Otherwise nice work on our first Ember project and way to “cherry pick!”

### Being a Community Member

Adam's feedback to me: It was a pleasure to work on another project with Kirsten and it was awesome that she decided she wanted to take on the task of setting up react router, even though Paul and I had already used it. I think it is great that she always pushes herself to learn new things and really want to understand them as well. If she had an opportunity from this project it would be making sure she gets more comfortable splitting the project into smaller sections and not worrying about  being a part of all the project. Also she did an amazing job at making sure our css and layout was in order at the end of the project to make sure we had a great user experience as well.

Casey's feedback to me: Kirsten was great to work with. She’s amiable and detail-oriented, and has an outstanding work ethic. She has strong motivation in terms of completing projects to spec, and making them look good, while helping other students along the way. My only advice to Kirsten would be to avoid the trap of just doing too much work on her own, but to practice holding group members accountable for their fair share. I feel like she may be too good at picking up slack.

Paul's feedback to me:
Kirsten and I worked on our Weather App together along with Adam and Casey. This was the first time we’ve collaborated on a project and Kirsten was super accommodating and calm when I’m stressed out and nothing is working. I feel like we accomplished a lot together by just pairing and tackling small bits of the project. She is a willing communicator, and isn’t afraid to take initiative and drive when everyone is stuck. I learned a lot from her and would gladly pair with her on future projects.

MaryJane's feedback to me:
I enjoyed working with you on learning a brand new framework in Ember. I feel like our system of working together until we felt comfortable tackling issues on our own was productive and helped us better learn Ember. The best thing I gained from working with you is that whenever I wanted to go ask for help you wouldn’t let me because you thought we could figure it out ourselves - and you were usually right. This has really helped me with my personal project.

### Playing a Part

At the beginning of module 3 I helped set-up the pairing stations at the Bank.

On November 3rd, at a Sass meet-up I spoke with a person interested in coding bootcamps and told her about Turing and the application process. Also I was trying to convince her that Turing was much better than Galvanize!

On November 4th, I paired with module 1 students to work on their game project.

### Personal Project Pitch
We pitched our personal project when Allison came into our class to discuss how to pick our projects. We discussed with a partner if we had any reservations. At the time I had two ideas: one was to make a birthday tracker app and the other one was to make something similar to yelp, but for local hangout spots. My reservations with the projects were that I didn't want to make something too simple or something that had already been done. Then we had to reflect about how our project solved a problem. Next we needed to figure out our target audience. Lastly, we needed to come up with an objective.
