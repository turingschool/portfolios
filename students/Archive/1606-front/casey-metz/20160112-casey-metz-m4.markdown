## Individual Assessment

One of my goals was to have more commits this mod than any other. I haven't counted exactly--it's close with mod 2--but I'm close enough to feel okay about checking this box.

A few goals remain unfinished:
Polishing up old projects until they're presentable is high on the list. With lots of holiday travel distractions and the pressure of the points system, I didn't feel like I had much feel time to invest in old projects. That's the way of Turing right? Keeping one's head just barely above water counts as success, and getting out ahead of things is nearly impossible, so I'm not beating myself up about this goal.

Additionally, obviously, job stuff ever remains. I'm oddly calm about this. It'll be much easier to invest in job-hunting now that the days are empty, and I have the cognitive free space to get excited about it.

I don't have the time or patience at the moment to write a well-thought-out reflection on my overall time at Turing, but suffice it to say that the experience was significant enough that I _want_ to. I'm sure the nostalgia will set it soon enough, and the importance of this turing point will become clear as the daily intensity fades away.

## Projects

#### _Imposter Syndrome_

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

A desktop notes-taking app build in electron.

#### _Curiously Native_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Casey1449/React-Native)

Our first React Native project. We build an app based around an API provided by the National Renewable Energy Lab. It allows the user to enter their preferred alternative vehicle fuel, and directs them to the nearest filling stations. 147/175 (low only due to lack of blog posts).

Feedback to me is included in the larger feedback section below.

#### _Jet Fuel_

A backend project involving building a server, a url-shortener, and persistence with mongodb. 83/100.

Feedback to me is included in the larger feedback section below.

#### _Capstone Project_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/git-in-the-game)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

An electron menu-bar app that compares your current week's github activity to last week's, using fancy data visualizations. 260/325.

## Professional Development

Top three priorities in the job search are 1) to stay in Denver, 2) to find a smallish, casual, friendly work environment that isn't too corporate, and 3) to find an environment that is learner-friendly, where mistakes are okay.

I plan to do this by completing my cold outreach and having as many conversations as possible with representative of different employeers, and to ask _explicit_ questions about Jr dev on-boarding, and the learning environment for new devs.

I've sent 2 of 6 cold outreach emails, and will complete for more before the end of day tomorrow.

## Community

### Gear Up

  1. Microaggressions:

    I was worried about this Gear Up topic from the start, because as someone who cares about this sort of idea, I anticipated that it would become the butt of jokes and side comments for weeks to come. That was pretty much the case. The people who find it so easy to make fun of microaggressions mostly belong to the groups unaffected by them. Oh well. I commend Turing for trying.

  2. Journey Mapping:

    I didn't quite understand this activity as well as some other gearups. The goal seemed to be to build sympathy for users by trying to imaging their life histories, but I think this principle was obscured by the fact that, during the exercise, we focused on telling our _own_ life stories, and _listening_ to others' life stories, which is backwards from the concept of forcing oneself to creatively _imagine another's_ life story.

  3. Grit:

    Grit is the combination of stick-to-it-ivness and passion, a formula for success. As always with this sort of thing, I question whether these qualities are in any way 'choices.' More specifically, the concept of grit fails to take into account mental health. About 7% of Americans are on anti-depressants. For some, rolling out of bed in the morning to face another day is a grand achievement, but they will never be looked upon as a person with 'grit.' I think this lesson is incomplete without some allowance for nuerodiversity, and maybe even a discussion about the truthiness or falsiness of free will.

##Feedback

###Given:

To Casey Cross:
_I was happy to get the opportunity to work with my friend Casey this mod. I was impressed by her excellent instinct for project management and organization, keeping me motivated and accountable. She's willing to take on any task with good humor and energy, and she pushes herself to stick with challenging problems. My suggestion for Casey would be to keep an eye on her 'self-talk'; during our project, she sometimes fell into the trap of defeatism, emphasizing the negatives of the situation. This kind of self-deprecation can threaten to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our project turned out well, and I'd encourage Casey to recognize that she's more capable than she sometimes gives herself credit for. I've appreciated Casey's strength and realness for my entire time here at Turing, and I hope she carries her social awareness, and the power of her voice, with her into the working world. I'm confident she will._

To Madison:
_I'm so glad I finally got to work with Madison! I don't think I've ever laughed so much during a project, even when facing obstacles. It felt great to fully cooperate on both the design and implementation of the project, and know that we were on the same page at every step. I attribute this to Madison's natural approachability and excellent communication skills. Madison's eye for design and instinctive sympathy for the user will take her far in front-end development. My suggestion for Madison would be to take caution not to over-extend herself--she's a busy woman who happily pursues many commitments at once. She's actually done an excellent job of this while at Turing, so I'm really just suggesting that she take note of the balance she's found between ambition and reliability, and hold that balance. I'll miss siphoning inspiration and enthusiasm from Madison, and I hope we get to work together again._

To Kyle:
_I worked with Kyle on two projects this mod: Jet Fuel and the Capstone Project. In general, I've been super impressed with Kyle's growth as a developer and team member over the last seven months. Two notable strengths that I respect are: 1) his ability to manage group productivity and hold us accountable for goals, pushing a project forward, and 2) his ability to not get stuck on something too long. Kyle strikes a good balance of trying to figure it out, researching it, then asking for help. This is something I struggle with, so I'm going to take note of Kyle's skill at using human resources to solve problems, and how much better than works than tunnel-visioned brain-racking._

### Received:

From Casey Cross:
_I worked with Casey during our React Native project.  Casey has the best first name out of anyone in our cohort.  We worked very well together.  We both wanted to create a mobile app that was meaningful and had a positive impact on the world, thus we chose to make an app to locate alternative energy sources.  I very much enjoyed working with Casey as we share a goofy, light-hearted sense of humor that helped us get through some of the tougher moments of our project.  Casey is helpful and hard-working and has a good understanding of Redux, which is no small feat.  He is going to excel in his career and would be an asset to any team._

From Madison:
_sdf_

From Kyle:
_Feedback for JetFuel: I enjoyed working with you again Casey! As far as our first backend project went I thought we were able to get a functioning Express server up & running in no time. I always learn something new when I'm working with you. You have a unique insight that allows you to find just the right solution / approach for any problem we're facing. You're a kickass programmer & I look forward to seeing what you accomplish outside of Turing._

From Blake:
_When authentication threw us problems, Casey didn't skip a beat and came up with an ingenious way for us to grab information from github without authentication. Great job. I am excited to see what you accomplish outside of turing in the development world._

### Community Summary:

Again, I feel like I invested a fair amount in the Turing community. This mod, mostly through SAB. But I really invested quite a bit in SAB. I think anyone would corroborate that I'm a valuable contributor, and that I work to offer constructive suggestions on what can be done to enhance the experience for future Turing students.
