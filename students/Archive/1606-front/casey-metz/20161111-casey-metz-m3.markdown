# Casey Metz - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This is always a challenging, because I always forget to set 'areas of emphasis' at the beginning of a new mod. My accidental areas of emphasis were: practicing tuning out distractions and other obligations for the sake of working, stretching myself too thing through both SAB and leading Pahlka, and trying not to compare myself to others in the cohort, which I felt for the first time this mod. I did do some job-y things like going to several meetups, forcing myself to tweet a little, etc.

Here, I'll to it now. For mod 4, I want to emphasize:
* Crafting a show-able portfolio, probably through polishing up old projects, deploying them, and making sure they're in a presentable state. (This will help me review old stuff too, like jquery and O.O.).
* Focus on coding: Write more lines. Bold goal: I should have more commits next mod than any other, even if it means adopting a side project.
* Stop sucking at testing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

No scores given.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### _This Just In_, aka _Self-Directed Project_, a customizable news headline aggregator

My self-directed project was built with React, Redux, and Firebase. The user logs in and selects up to 60 different news sources to populate the pages ('front', 'sports', 'business', etc) of their personal newspaper. They see a news stream of the top 10ish articles from each source in the appropriate place, which persists across sessions, but is easy to edit.

Testing: 2
Code quality: 3
Features Completion: 4
Workflow Organization: 3
Performance (speed): 4
User Experience: 4

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We did two official group projects this mod: a weather app, and "Remember", a notes app.

#### _Weather Forecast_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

Get the current weather and 5-day forecast for your present location, and your pinned cities!

* Evaluation comments

Comments: liked our handleSubmit function and how the functionality and state were kept in the component, good prioritizing with having things work with components first before breaking out into containers, have containers only return the component or actionCreator that is needed and not the whole state, start testing with reducers and actions rather than components first, start with one reducer file and then break out into separate files, make more use of Github tools

* Evaluation Scores

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

  1. Vote Your Conscience: The weird thing about this one was that all the readings focused on the 'rights and responsibilities' that citizenship imparts. I journaled about about my skepticism that rights and responsibilities flow from nation-states, which seem like a someone obsolete and arbitrary unit of community organization. I think that rights and responsibilities flow from the series of nested communities that we identify with, and they are most strong in the communities closest to us.

  We also talked about how, regardless of party, policy is driven by rich oligarchs, regardless of overall popularity. Our conclusion in group discussion was that voting is a good thing, but it's a very slow way to make change, because it follows culture, which requires large-scale generational transitions in order to change significantly.

  2. Introversion: This one hit close to home. It's nice to hear acknowledgement of the advantages that extrovert have in the world, and at Turing. It was also nice to do this Gear Up in our own cohort, since it seemed relevant to our pairing dynamics.

  3. Resilience: I played devil's advocate here a little bit: I journaled about how resilience thinking is very useful from a first-person stance, but it gets risky from a second-person stance. In other words, it would be easy to fall into victim blaming through the language of resilience, if you evaluate someone else to be over-reacting to a challenging event, when they should just "be more resilient." I'm also worried that it could lead to insensitivity: There are probably things we _should_ be horrified by, even if it means it's hard to bounce back. Our group talked about how we each practice resilience at Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Blake:
_Working with Blake was great. He has this great thing where he thinks he doesn’t understand things, and he thinks he’s asking basic questions, but he actually does understand things, and he’s asking great questions. This dynamic forced me to think a lot, and to learn through trying to explain things I didn’t fully understand, which was fun. My advice for Blake would be to take things one small step at a time, and be okay with moving through issues slowly and methodically…it’s okay not to understand everything all at once._

To Kirsten:
 _Kirsten was great to work with. She’s amiable and detail-oriented, and has an outstanding work ethic. She has strong motivation in terms of completing projects to spec, and making them look good, while helping other students along the way. My only advice to Kirsten would be to avoid the trap of just doing too much work on her own, but to practice holding group members accountable for their fair share. I feel like she may be too good at picking up slack._

To Paul:
_Paul was great to work with. He's patient and a good listener, and very easygoing. The only suggestion I can think of would be to take on more active leadership in his projects, working to include all his group-mates and drive the project forward. I think his easygoing manner would make him good at that. But he seems to be right where he needs to be, asking for advice when he needs it, and giving out help in a very non-condescending manner._

To Adam:
_I enjoyed working with Adam on our weather app. He is a quick learner and helped to push the group forward with his enthusiasm. I appreciated his initiative towards splitting the group up into pairs and organizing our tasks. My suggestions for Adam are: 1) to "drive" more during group/pairing sessions, and 2) to practice using more "we"-based language when giving advice, e.g. "I think we should try...." instead of "you should do..." This goes a long way towards others feeling receptive and collaborative. Overall Adam is really good at figuring out new technologies, and he's good at using his excitement to drive  projects forward._

To Trent Whitinger:
_During last mod's screening of 'Debugging the Gender Gap' I was angry to learn that most of my cohort skipped out. But you know who didn't skip out that day? Trent. I was also in Trent's group for the Lunch Roulette and Gearup session addressing voting, and he  was engaged and made meaningful contributions to our discussions. I know that Trent's been trying to improve his participation in community-related activities, and, as a peer, I can see him doing that, and I appreciate it. It's hard to change habits, and it takes courage to undo an identity in front of a large group of people. I'm not sure how other Fridays have gone, but on those two, my experience was richer for having him as a part of this community._

### Being a Community Member

From Kirsten:
_This was the first time working with you and it was thoroughly enjoyable! Way to step up with tackling fetching the API data. That showed great initiative in trying to figure out something new. Also you described your methodology of fetching the API very clearly to me as well as in the markdown that you created. I thought that was a great idea to include that in our project to show how the API data was being accessed. You did a fine job with making an effort to include everyone and holding our group together. The only critique I have for you is to have touched on more parts of the project like Sass or testing. I know that it was a priority with getting the Redux functionality working, but I know you had mentioned you would have liked to have worked on some Sass at the beginning, so perhaps to take a break from learning Redux you could have jumped into some styling. Otherwise I enjoyed observing your logical approach to solving problems and your team comradery._

From Blake:
_Casey, you have a way with people and are excellent at breaking down complex subjects. I wanted to say it was great working with you and I look forward to doing so again in the future. I appreciated that you had a different method than myself, slow down to speed up, and I have integrated more of that approach after working with you._

From Adam:
_It was great to finally be able to work with Casey on a project.  He did great at making sure that we weren’t rushing anything and that we were understanding what was going on in the app before we just starting writing in code.  This made it easier to make sure we weren't getting stuck in parts. This could also be seen as an opportunity as he could get stuck taking a lot of time figuring out things.  Otherwise it was amazing that he took on the API calls and making sure that we hooked them up correctly and utilize the data.  It was also amazing that he took the time at the end of the project to help us get redux working._

From Paul:
_This was the first time working with Casey and it was great. I applaud his organizational skills when it came to starting this project. He advised taking the DTR to another level and have a mid project assessment. By doing that I think it benefitted everyone in the group because it was a time to reflect on how the project was coming along and if each of our personal goals were getting accomplished. I haven’t experience that in any of my other group projects and I thought it was a great idea. I know Casey was nervous in the beginning of the project but his easygoing attitude and willingness to communicate and contribute helped us pull off this project the night before it was due. I wish I had a critique for you but I don’t._

From Ali Schlereth:
_As my Pahlka Possee co-leader this module, Casey has been a steady balanced presence. I appreciate his drive to make forward progress on our project while also providing great emotional leadership for the great. Casey you have a great pastoral presence, thank you!_  

### Playing a Part

Like I said in the self-assessment, I stretched myself too thin this mod. I was voluntold to co-lead Pahlka posse, and elected to SAB. This mostly meant a lot of traveling between buildings, lost lunches, Slack distractions, and a host of other duties that I found pretty psychologically draining.

In addition, I went to my first couple of meetups this mod, initiated the food/clothing drive, attended the Glow in the Gardens event, and the Rock the Ballot event.
