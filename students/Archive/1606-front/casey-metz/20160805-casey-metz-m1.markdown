# Casey Metz - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This being the first module, my focus was on the basics: showing up every day, doing the work, staying healthy, forging positive relationships with my cohort-mates, and transitioning into full Turing immersion. I think I succeeded, because I feel immersed, and well.

### End of Module Assessment

My evaluator was Brenna. Some feedback I received was: "I'm going to give you a 4 on Javascript style even though Steve will probably scold me. It's rare to see this much refactoring happening on a first pass at this point." She also pointed out that I should grow my repertoire of keyboard shortcuts to reduce my mouse reliance and improve my speed.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Color-Changer

* https://github.com/Casey1449/Color-Changer
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html

A 24-hour solo project that generates randomly colored backgrounds at the push of a button. I used a recursive function to prevent the default home screen color, (255, 255, 255), from being generated.

#### Personal Website

* https://github.com/Casey1449/portfolio-site
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html

My personal portfolio website, built from scratch. This one is always changing and improving, so you may catch it in various states of redesign.

## Team

### Projects

We had four major paired projects this module, mostly focused on 1) HTML and CSS and 2) creating a user interface and manipulating the DOM based on the user's actions, through both javascript and jQuery.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/Casey1449/Number-Guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

A number-guessing game featuring a random number generator, and the ability to set your own parameters on the range of guessable numbers. Also features some preliminary attempts at input validation, making sure the input number is indeed a number, and is within the correct range. Pure Vanilla JS.

JS Style: 3

_Really enjoyed working with you on my first project at Turing. I think we were both figuring out Git & Github, but ended up with a great final version on our Github. Functionally, the number guesser turned out exactly how we liked. One thing we both stressed during DTR was learning as much as we could, and I do feel there were times where we came in after a night of work and you had completed a lot. I think moving forward making sure to communicate your rationale and methods for getting things to work will make the teams you’re in that much more cohesive. Definitely looking forward to working with you again!_ -Kyle Misencik

#### Bookmarkr (aka Linked-List)

* https://github.com/Casey1449/Linked-List
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Bookmarkr is an app for bookmarking websites and their URLs. You can mark your bookmarks as "read" or "unread", clear away your "read" bookmarks, and keep track of how many you have with the built-in counters. We included a URL validation regex. The styling was intended to mimic (and possibly parody) typical start-up design tropes, like the pastel colors, Lobster font, and the missing "e" in the spelling.

_Casey was a pleasure to work with. This was our first project with jQuery and the first one that really used Github, and Casey was exceedingly communicative and patient with me when I wanted to try things that almost certainly wouldn’t work just for the sake of trying. We had a very comfortable, easygoing working relationship that benefited greatly from Casey’s willingness to give mature, constructive criticism when I was going down a dead end and receive it when he was on the wrong track. He was always willing to at least listen and talk through approaches that were different than his, even if they didn’t work. I’m definitely looking forward to working with him again._ -Brett Hevia

#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/kerrd89/idea-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

IdeaBox built on the foundation laid by Bookmarkr, but introduced many new concepts, like searching through ideas, using the browser's local storage, enabling user-editable text, and upvote/downvoting. The app is fully mobile-responsive, and we implemented the "filter by quality" extension.

_Really enjoyed working with you.  I think you do a great job of listening which makes communication over issues/working through issues really simple.  Our workflow was limited because we were able to complete the project in person, but based on that limited experience then only constructive feedback I could give was that we could have done a better job of refactor and figuring out the most optimal path, but that was due to my music festival, and I really appreciated your flexibility around that schedule._ -David Kerr

#### Blanched Almonoid (aka Game-Time)

* https://github.com/Casey1449/Game-Time
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

For our Game-Time project we chose to make our own version of a classic Breakout style game. It is built purely in javascript. Styled after a 50's cookbook theme. The game allows the player to choose any of 10 different levels to play. Clicking the 'Start Blanchin!' button gives the player a countdown timer before the almond is launched. Gameplay continues until the player clears all the bricks or loses the almond 3 times. At any time a player is able to change the level using the buttons in the lower left corner of the screen.

The "blanched almond" theme is a tribute to our favorite CSS named color, "blanchedalmond," aka #FFEBCD. Our cohort was tickled to discover such a fancied-up name for what is essentially beige, and it spiraled into an over-cooked inside joke. The color itself is featured prominently in the game's styling.

This was a complex project with a lot code and a lot of moving parts (literally and figuratively). You can read more about the challenges and opportunities in our Readme file on the repo.

(This project's DTR memo will serve as my required example. You can see it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VUfH0GHXUor8EJ3o_etrP2wlhOldmpC2AO0CRjp0Wc/edit?ts=57969751#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg)

_It was great working with Casey on this project and I feel really fortunate that I had him as a partner.  Casey is a very strong developer and super smart.  He got us out of many tough points with strong ideas and a good approach to problem solving.  The only actionable feedback I can give is on something I’m working on for myself.  We both had a tendency to just dive into the code on our own machines at times when we were really stuck, which probably took longer to find a solution than if we continued to bounce ideas off each other and work the problem together.  I think this is just something for us both to work on any time we’re in a pairing situation and we can continue to collaborate with other students.  I’m really pleased with how the project turned out overall and will really look forward to working with Casey in the future._ -Jeff Duke

## Community

### Giving Feedback

For Kyle: Kyle was a great first project partner. On Number Guesser he went out of his way to lead the DTR. As he mentioned in my feedback, I was a bit eager on this first project, and sometimes raced ahead without clear task delegation. Kyle communicated this in a respectful way, and we were able to re-set our expectations before the end of the project. By the end, we were doing a better job of sharing driving and tasks, and Kyle kicked butt on styling our site. He has a great work ethic and knows how to seek the help and resources necessary to complete difficult tasks. Looking forward to working together again!

For Brett:  Brett was very easy to work with. He’s always approachable and calm, and listens well. He did a good job keeping the project moving forward, methodically moving us through the rubric. It was on this project when we both got the hang of github (because we had some terrible merge conflicts) and Brett was patience and determined that we get it right, and it paid off in terms of workflow. Looking forward to working together again.

For David: David is a great person to be paired with on a project. He is a prolific coder who lands on solutions quickly, and pulls his team along with energy and gusto. He communicated his schedule clearly, and helped us keep on task by managing our Trello board. At times it was hard to keep up and feel like I was matching his contributions to our code base, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing when operating on a deadline . I look forward to working with him again in the future.

For Jeff: I wouldn't have wanted to be paired with anyone else for a project of this magnitude. Jeff is a super-strong coder, with the creativity to break through the hard problems, and the discipline to write tests and refactor code. Our DTR created a great working environment and we were able to comfortably check in at several points along the way. Even when we decided to divide-and-conquer, we were able to come back together and share our ideas, and the result was that we accomplished our shared goal of each understanding the entire code base. One opportunity for both Jeff and I is that we are both vulnerable to getting tunnel-visioned/obsessed by a code problem, and retreating into our own mental worlds. This worked great when we were paired together, because we could feel free to break apart, work, and reunite. However, this approach may not work as well if our future pairs require more constant interaction. But in the end this was a really positive experience, and I'm really proud of both our product and our collaboration.

### Being a Community Member

I incorporated the feedback I received form cohort-mates in the project sections above, and haven't received explicit feedback beyond that. My self-evaluation in terms of community involvement resides in the following section.

### Playing a Part

I feel I've made a reasonably strong effort to becoming involved in the Turing world beyond Champus. The strongest example of this is my involvement in the Pahlka posse. The Pahlka group has been creating a home affordability app that displays the best best Denver neighborhoods based on the user's chosen price range and transportation needs. I've attended the once-a-week lunch meetings, after school meetings, and a weekend hack-a-thon during which we implemented a lot of the functionality. Although I was only able to contribute a few lines of code, I made myself useful by contributing jQuery syntax advice, and I learned a lot by watching the upper-mod backenders work. I also gained a cursory understanding of geoJSON files and mapBox. I'm excited to deepen my involvement in Pahlka's next project, and to inherit more responsibility moving forward.

In addition to Pahlka, I've attended two film screenings with other Turing students: _The Internet's Own Boy_, which tells the story of Aaron Schwartz, which was screened in the evening at Blake, and _Code: Debugging the Gender Gap_, which was screened (along with a panel discussion) in the evening at the Colorado Museum of Natural History. Both produces rich group discussion.

More informally, I strive to be available, approachable, and patient when my fellow students ask me for help. As a result, others seem comfortable asking me for code advice.

Lastly, I'll be demoing my Game-Time game tonight at Demo Night, along with my project partner.

### Notes

has matched expectations, being with a mod2 student in the backend helped set expectations of hours that need to get put in. Overall, enjoying everything.

has been involved with pahlka posse, very engaged, works over lunches sometimes weekends. wants to be able contribute more, and will be able to contribute longer and more substantially than backend students since they tend to only be able to contribute in late modules.

Staff: takes feedback exceptionally well. Can take a concept or suggestion and incorporate it. You can see the big picture goal, then step back and take the small steps to get your there.

### Outcome

PASS
