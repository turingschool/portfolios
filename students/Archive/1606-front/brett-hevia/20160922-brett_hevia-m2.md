# Brett Hevia - M2 FE Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to do more Turing community-related stuff this module which, recent events notwithstanding, I think I did. I led a couple of Friday spike sessions and did a bunch of pairing sessions with 1608. I also really wanted to put some reps in and try and get a better feel for some basic design stuff, and I'm pretty sure I failed miserably at that.

### End of Module Assessment

(I copied and pasted my mod 1 portfolio and am just updating it, but I didn't have to change any of this assessment stuff)
I had my assessment with Brenna again. I think it went well, again.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### Workflow

* 4: I can't remember what the four stuff said, but Brenna seemed to not hate the way I navigated around.

#### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


## Projects


### A Very Lonely Chatroom

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bretthev/chatroom-adventures)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html)

This was the first project of the module and was mostly review, but we did get introduced to feature tests/Selenium/webdriver and set up our own webpacks, which was cool and maddening. I had a great time on this project mostly because I felt pretty comfortable with the logic and got to incorporate some stupid, immature jokes in the bot responses. This was also the first time I realized how bad I am at thinking about UX/UI stuff.

#####Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#####User Interface

* 2.5 - color contrast and choice issues, line lengths are pretty long on big screens, icons need a little clarity. very good start, needs some polish.

#####HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#####CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#####JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#####Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#####Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

#FEEDBACK HERE

#####Design

* 2.5 - feels like they didn't have enough to get through implementation. really good start, very interesting direction.

### Tier One (Pomodoro App)

* [Github repo here](https://github.com/bretthev/tier-one-timer-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

This project was sneaky hard. We nailed down the timer logic pretty early on, but we sort of couldn't see the forest for the trees when it came to our UI decisions. Like, it did everything we wanted it to in the way that we wanted it to, we just wanted it to do dumb things. This was probably my least favorite project of the module because it probably had the least amount of new material and I was kind of just waiting for it to end the last few days.

#####Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. -->

#####User Interface

* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

#####HTML

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#####CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

Note: good job investigating ways to use CSS, dove into :before and :after and animations. needs some tidying.

#####JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#####Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows… 4 - Zero complaints

#####Design

* 2.75 - needs some polish, there are good instincts and direction that flushed out in a more complete way.


###Tier-two

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/tier-two)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

This project was pretty great. We had a strong group and there was a LOT to learn with React and Firebase and all. It was also the first time we worked with groups instead of just partners (kind of). The two week timeframe was nice too and really benefited our group, at least. We basically spent the first week just messing around with Firebase and React and then were able to crank out the core functionality in a couple of days once we got a solid (and by solid I mean tenuous) grasp on the database fundamentals.

* Instructor: Jhun, Brenna (Design)

* Student: Brett Hevia, Peter Springer, Casey Metz, Kris Foss.

#####Notes:

* spec adherence was kind of soft but they delivered a working application! (i'd use it)
tests checked for existence and thats about it.
pumped group took risks

#####Design

* Enjoyed the design choices for landing page, team worked hard to write mobile-friendly markup. Good use of limited fancy-styles ($ amount) and streamline white font. Color scheme on landing page is well thought out. Criticisms fall only on index page where the box size hinders user's view of past purchases. Also red color button is out of place. Would like to see a simplified/easier to view display box (roped into UI score).

* User interface could use some clarification. Does it take dollars with or without decimal? When it says "date" can I say "today" or do I need to put in numbers and in what order?

#####Specification Adherence

* 3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#####Risk Taking and Creativity

* 3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

#####Design

* 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

#####User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#####HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#####CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#####JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#####Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

#####Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#####Code Sanitation

* The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


###Shoot-the-breeze

I really enjoyed this project. I felt like component architecture and state-related stuff really started to come together and I'm pretty pumped about the possibilities of something like Flux. I also feel like I made some strides in terms of letting go of the reins a little and letting my partner have more responsibility than I would have 3 weeks ago. Also got better at doing database stuff.

### Getting Feedback

* From Madison: Brett, you are awesome! I am so impressed with your humble nature and extreme talent as a coder and teacher. You helped me work though so many issues with knowledge and patience. Thank you for all of your help. Your explanations are always clear and direct. The way you explain functions line by line helped me understand the progression of code, with little room for misunderstanding. Your intense devotion to deeply understand code is extremely admirable. Your positive, exploratory approach is motivating and has led to some cool extra curricular coding art pieces(like the exploding faces sprite exploration). Your humor always keeps me on my toes and laughing. No time was your humor more evident than when you spent the time to create a chatbot with curated messages about each of the students in the class; although, I changed a couple of the chatbot responses (merge request waiting). I hope to continue our coding exploration to create more awesome stuff!

* From Paul: Brett and I worked on our Pomodoro app project. He was accommodating and patient when I didn’t understand some of the logic. He’s great at teaching and breaking down situations into smaller accomplishable sections. I definitely had fun creating fart noises and learned a lot being partners with Brett. I would work with Brett again on future projects.

* From Casey M: I worked with Brett on the tier two project (budget app). Brett’s energy and work ethic were very motivating and he pushed our group forward. It was super helpful to have him holding the group accountable for meeting our goals, and his great sense of humor helped brighten the mood when things got difficult. One opportunity for Brett is to help ensure that his group-mates are all getting equal learning opportunities—he picks up on things super fast, so it’s easy for him to bite off a disproportionate amount of the labor, so maybe some of that energy could be spent on tutoring groupmates and aiding their learning? In general, Brett and I work well together, and I look forward to working with him again.

* From Pete: Brett and I worked together on the Tier-Two project. Having a four person group allowed for a decent amount of divide and conquer. Brett's willingness to research unfamiliar concepts and help other teammates understand them made him a pleasure to work with. When we found ourselves burning down our project and basically starting from scratch Brett did not hesitate and viewed it as a learning opportunity. I would be happy to work with Brett again.

### Giving Feedback

* To Madison: I worked with Madison for the first project of the module (lonely chatroom) and she was a fantastic partner. She’s incredibly meticulous and detail-oriented (which I appreciate because of how not either of those things I am,)  but she’s also able and willing to take a big-picture view and try to learn new stuff. She was  patient with my need to indulge dumb whims (like when I wasted an entire day writing dumb bot responses for everyone in class) and my general stubbornness when it comes to problem-solving. Madison’s infectious energy and enthusiasm for learning kept me out of my habit of getting burnt out/bored with a project with a few days left and sort of crawling to the finish line.

* To Paul: I worked with Paul on the Tier One project (Pomodoro app). I’m prone to bouts of stubbornness and tunnel-vision during projects, and Paul was super accommodating and relaxed when it came to indulging some of my whims. I definitely appreciated his go-with-the-flow vibe. He was a willing communicator and not afraid to take initiative/the lead when I was spinning my wheels or hitting a wall. Also he put fart noises in our project and thus will always have a special place in my heart.

* To Casey M: I worked with Casey on the tier two project (budget app). In addition to being super smart and quick to pick stuff up, Casey’s thoroughness and attention to detail were crucial to the success of our project. He’s a patient and open communicator and he’s also super willing to laugh at stuff and doesn’t take himself too seriously, which is a big plus. I’d happily work with Casey again anytime.

* To Pete: I worked with Pete on our Tier-Two project (budget app). This was our first time working with a (relatively) large group, and I think Pete’s pragmatism and ability to separate the stuff we could focus on from the stuff we SHOULD focus on repeatedly kept us from getting too far off track. We were also all learning React and Firebase for this project and he was willing to just try stuff and get outside his comfort zone to find out what did and didn’t work. I’d happily work with Pete on future projects.

### Playing a Part

So, again, outside of this last Friday, I think I did a much better job of interacting with the Turing community at large. I led a couple of student-led sessions to start the module and made myself readily available for pairing times with 1608.

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5 - This is just an average of my scores from the assessment.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3 - Thank you for pushing back the deadline on the font and design projects. I really enjoyed doing them and I'm looking forward to making them a lot better this week.
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5 - I think I was definitely a key contributor to every project that I worked on this mod, but I could still be quicker and more willing to rely on my partners/teammates than I have been.
* **D: Community Participation**: 3 - Discussed above.
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3, I guess. I don't know. I can't tell how much of my partner feedback is genuine and how much is just glossing over the bad parts of working with me or me refusing to believe nice stuff about me.
