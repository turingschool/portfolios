# Brett Hevia - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I didn't have any idea what to expect either from the program or myself (and I was honestly a little worried I was going to flunk out immediately), but I've been incredibly impressed with the program, the Turing community at large, and especially my classmates. Also, I didn't flunk out immediately!

### End of Module Assessment

I had my assessment with Brenna. I think it went well.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


### Work

(Intro)

#### Random Color Changer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bretthev/color-changer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

This was a quick single night solo project that required us to make a page with two buttons, one to randomize the background color and another to reset it to white. I really liked being able to rely on just myself and focus on some things like CSS that I had sort of been neglecting to this point.

Functional: 4
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 3
HTML: 3
CSS: 3

#### Personal Portfolio

* [Github repo here](https://github.com/bretthev/portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

I haven't kept up with this project as much as I should have, and as a result I've ended up giving it a complete overhaul a few times. At first I found it kind of tedious and would get bored after a few minutes, but within the last week or so I've really enjoyed focusing on the CSS and HTML fundamentals that I think I neglected early on.
## Team

### Projects

These pair projects were my first experience working with and relying on someone else so heavily in a professional/academic environment. At first I was a little skeptical about the benefits of pair-programming, but I realized pretty quickly that it's a necessary and invaluable tool that should be exercised as often as possibel.

#### Number Guesser

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/bretthev/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first project and also our first time seeing Javascript exist outside of a text editor.

Functional: 4
JS Style: 2.5

From Casey Cross: I worked with Brett on the first project of module 1. We were both very green in our workflow as is expected early in module 1.  I found him easy to collaborate with and our skills complemented each other well. I think we both learned a lot from each other. I would happily work with Brett again in the future. Also, he is a fellow Gator which earns him extra bonus points.

#### Linked List

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/bretthev/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first project with jQuery and lots of DOM manipulation, and it was also the first where we were expected to maintain a collaborative workflow via Github. Casey and I had one big hiccup on Github early on, but it sort of served as motivation to be extra careful moving forward.

Functional: 3
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 4
HTML: 3
CSS: 3

From Casey Metz: Brett was very easy to work with. He’s always approachable and calm, and listens well. He did a good job keeping the project moving forward, methodically moving us through the rubric. It was on this project when we both got the hang of github (because we had some terrible merge conflicts) and Brett was patience and determined that we get it right, and it paid off in terms of workflow. Looking forward to working together again.

#### Idea Box

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/bretthev/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea box was our first object-oriented project and also the first that dealt with storage of any kind.

This project was, for me, the hardest of the module. Andy and I really struggled early on to get traction with object-orientation and fell way behind most of the other groups. We did end up with a passable final product, and our early struggles with the theory definitely made me more confident going into the last few weeks of the module.

Spec adherence: 3
User interface: 3
JS: 2.5
Workflow: 3

From Andy Young: Working with Brett was great. He listened intently to my ideas and showed patience while I explored different ways to build our project. This turned out to be critical to our success. On a few occasions I had adopted a poor strategy that would not have worked, yet Brett was patient and graceful in guiding our efforts so that we ​could make progress. A word on determination..
Brett’s energy is electrifying! When Brett sets his mind to complete something, it gets done! It was great to see him in the flow, and often inspired me to push a little harder. What I learned from Brett (among many things) is that when I think I’m done, I can still go much further!

#### Game Time

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/kerrd89/Trawn)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project required us to combine everything we've learned about HTML, CSS, Canvas, JavaScript, and object-oriented programming to recreate a classic video game.

This was easily my favorite project of the module. Not having explicit steps and wireframes to work off of was exciting (and terrifying), and having to think outside of the box and branch out a little really helped solidify the things we've already learned. Plus, I really like Trawn.

Functional Expectations: 4
User Interface: 4
Testing: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Casey Cross after Number Guesser: I worked with Casey on the first project of the module. Even though neither of us had any idea what we were doing when it came to Git (or anything, really), I never felt uncomfortable or worried about making mistakes because of how open and supportive Casey was. We were both able and willing to laugh at ourselves and recognize our shortcoming which made it easy to communicate and encouraged us to try stuff without fear of disapproval or letting each other down. I’d happily work with Casey again anytime.

To Casey Metz after Linked List: Casey was a pleasure to work with. This was our first project with jQuery and the first one that really used Github, and Casey was exceedingly communicative and patient with me when I wanted to try things that almost certainly wouldn’t work just for the sake of trying. We had a very comfortable, easygoing working relationship that benefited greatly from Casey’s willingness to give mature, constructive criticism when I was going down a dead end and receive it when he was on the wrong track. He was always willing to at least listen and talk through approaches that were different than his, even if they didn’t work. I’m definitely looking forward to working with him again.

### Playing a Part

While I was a generally helpful and pleasant classmate, I definitely didn't engage with the non-FE Turing community as much as I would've liked to. I think that's partly due to being in a different program in a different place than the back end folks, but it's mostly my fault for not being more proactive when it comes to getting involved on Fridays and just physically going to Blake St. more often. That's definitely something I'm going to aim to improve on next module.

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.25 - This is just my actual score on the assessment.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3 - I did a poor job of keeping up with my portfolio.
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 - I feel like I definitely made positive, valuable contributions to all the projects I was in. Moving forward, I'd like to focus on getting better and more willing at giving constructive criticism in feedback.
* **D: Community Participation**: 2 - I talked about this above, but I didn't do a great job of engaging with the non-FE community. I do think that I was a helpful and supportive classmate, though.
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3, I guess. My partners and classmates have at least pretended to like working with/being around me.

### Notes
didn’t have many expectations, was worried would be biting off more than he could chew. Trusted he could pick it up.

Has been more organized than expected, not as overwhelmed as he thought he’d be.

Idea Box was the hardest project, struggled with it. In the last couple of days figured it out. Idea Box was a turing point, the struggled and fighting with it made him so much better at JS. It was great to see.

Staff: get more involved with community, and mentoring other students


### Outcome
PASS
