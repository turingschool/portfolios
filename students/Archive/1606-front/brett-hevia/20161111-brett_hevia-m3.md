# Brett Hevia - M3 FE Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module was to extend the average time and effort and resources I tap when trying to solve a problem, and I definitely did that. I'm especially happy with how willing I was to start diving into the actual docs instead of just Stack Overflow.

### End of Module Assessment

I was a little nervous because I didn't write much non-Redux React this mod and haven't done much non-Firebase posting and getting, but it was fine.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### Progression/Completion

* 4: I don't know what the four stuff said here, but I finished?

#### Workflow

* 4: I can't remember what the four stuff said.

#### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


## Projects


### Weather App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

First project of the module, and it was a sssstttrrruuuuggggllllleeeee. I don't think everyone was just really struggling to get comfortable with Redux architecture and flow, and we ended up basically writing like 80% of the logic in the last two days. But like basically everything, it was a good way of learning stuff. I think I picked it up a little quicker than the rest of the group and I don't think I did a good enough job of explaining how or why I was doing stuff, though.

Also: it was SUPER cool to finally interact with real APIs and asynchronous JS and stuff. Also super cool to find out that it was surprisingly straightforward. And it was our first time using React Router. Also now that I'm listing all the new stuff we had to do I realize why we struggled with it so much.

### RemEmber

* [Github repo here](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/1606-remember-4)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember)

This project owned. I'm definitely going to fool around with Ember during the break a little because at this point I think I'm kind of a fan of the convention over configuration thing, but also the workflow-aspect of this project was SUPER enlightening and also less stressful. Really, that entire Ember-themed week with Brandon and the other guy that didn't say anything was one of my favorite of the program, I think.

#####User Stories Closed: 10


###Personal Project

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/bretthev/lunch-and-learn)

It was pretty liberating and exciting to be on my own, working at my own pace whenever and wherever I wanted. Spending the last three weeks neck-deep in Redux has been immensely valuable, not just for my ability to write and understand Redux (which is roughly 10000 times stronger than it was 3 weeks ago), but also for stuff I learned about using state in general (I spent the first week mostly reading.) The interaction with David at WillowTree was super helpful and constructive.

That said, I'm definitely not super impressed with what I ended up with. Like, I think the Redux and React code I wrote is OK, but I think I should have been able to finish a lot more than what I did. I feel like I focused too much on the journey and not enough on the destination, I guess. I should have spent way more time trying to get my testing suite to work, and I should have reached out for more feedback on my design choices (uniformly terrible, I think, per usual.) I feel like I dropped the ball, kinda.

BUT! I do have my very first technical interview with WillowTree next week, so there is that.

## Community

### Gear-Ups

##### Election and Civic Duty Gear-Up

This was the first Gear-Up of the mod, and it was OK. It didn't seem like there was quite enough stuff to challenge with each other, though. I mean, yes, everyone should vote. No, we don't want an oligarchy. Turing's a pretty liberal environment full of a bunch of smart people, and a topic like "Should we vet our leaders before voting for them?" didn't exactly set my group's world on fire, dialogue-wise.

##### Introversion

This was my favorite Gear-Up of the mod by a pretty wide margin. One, it was nice to have a Gear-up session with people that I know and like and actually see often. Two, I think it's a little more topical than "Should you vote" or "vague generalities about resilience." I really enjoyed the reading and trying to figure out where I fell on the introvert-extrovert scale and how that affects how I interact with everyone and where.


##### Resilience

This was my least favorite of the Gear-ups and also the one I remember the least about. I do remember that my group spent most of the discussion time in a semantic discussion about the definition of resilience that essentially boiled down to "it's all in the eye of the beholder." It wasn't super productive.

### Getting Feedback

* From Madison: Brett, I thought we worked efficient and effectively together on the Remember project. I admire your intensity and consistency to move forward. For this project I think we did a good job of working through the task at hand, stayed focused, and moved forward. Outside of this project, it was awesome that we got to bounce ideas off of one another in regard to jobs, profile content, and other endeavors. Thank you for all of your help and continuing to motivate me.

* From Casey: This was the second time I got to work with you and I think your overall technical skills have skyrocketed over the course of this program.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job of trying to isolate functionality and focus on one piece at a time but still maintaining a cohesive project.  You stayed calm and steady even when stuck and frustrated. My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

* From Kyle: Enjoyed working with you on this one. Your understanding of redux not only helped us complete the project, but also really helped me understand the benefit of what redux provides. You're also a natural leader & your get-things-done attitude will get you far. One thing I noticed is your tendency during pairing to grab the keyboard once you realize how to get something to work. I think the benefit of pairing is, if you're not driving, conveying to the other person what is needed in a way so that they can get things working. Otherwise I'm looking forward to seeing you continue to be a bad ass programmer. Hope to work with you again!

* From Mike: Brett and I worked on our weather app together. Brett is a quick learner and was great at taking the lead and explaining new concepts to the group. He excelled at steering our project and made an otherwise difficult learning experience manageable for us. Would definitely like to work with Brett again.

### Giving Feedback

* To Madison: I worked with Madison on the second project of the mod, RemEmber. Just like the first time Madison and I worked together, I found her positivity and energy infectious. I can be stubborn and reluctant to ask for help when I run into a problem, but Madison’s willingness to talk through and approach stuff from other angles really helped me open up to different approaches and problem-solving strategies.

* To Casey: I worked with Casey on the first project of the module, Weatherly. It was our first time working in groups of four and really dividing and conquering, and Casey took the initiative and spearheaded the testing and SASS architecture portions of our project. I think one of the biggest things our team struggled with was maintaining communication and explaining thought processes when it came time to bring a lot of our divided and conquered parts of the project together.

* To Mike: I worked with Mike on the first project of the module. This was our first time working with a large group, and I think Mike’s willingness to experiment and ability to stay positive was super important to our group’s success. I’d happily work with Mike on future projects.

* To Kyle: I worked with Kyle on the first project of the module. Kyle took the initiative in the setup phase of the project (Waffle, initial repo, etc…) and was really focused on maintaining scope over the course of the week. He was super open to collaboration while also being willing and able to take things on himself when it came time to divide and conquer, which is a very difficult balance to maintain. We sort of communicated kind of fitfully as a group at times, but I think that’s something that we’re all still learning how to do. I’d definitely work with Kyle again, he’s a super solid programmer with a great sense of humor.

### Playing a Part

I think I did a pretty good job interacting with the community. I didn't miss anything and I led a couple of student-led sessions, including one on Redux that I think was pretty helpful for some of us to just sit down and talk through a tutorial together.

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.75 - Math
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2.5 - I'm kinda bummed about my personal project.
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3 - I definitely pulled my weight in both group projects but, especially the Weather App, I didn't do enough to make sure my group mates understood and followed what we ended up with.
* **D: Community Participation**: 3 - Discussed above.
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3, I guess. I don't know. I can't tell how much of my partner feedback is genuine and how much is just glossing over the bad parts of working with me or me refusing to believe nice stuff about me.
