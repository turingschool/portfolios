# M4 Front-end Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn about react native and electron.
I think this module was successful at supplying me with enough
context to work on projects built with these tools going forward. I
also still struggled with redux coming into this module. However I am
pleased to report that although it took until week 5 of mod4 üòÇ I think I
finally have a handle on it now.

#### Community

#### Gear Up Reflections

Journey Mapping: I missed this gear up for an interview.

Micro Aggressions: This gear up always seems to stir up trouble. I would suggest that Turing does not use this one any longer or finds new material for it. I honestly think the goal of creating an inclusive community would come faster and organically by eliminating controversial gear ups. Maybe try hosting spike sessions for people who want to be involved in these discussions.

Grit: Grit to me is how someone responds to challenges while trying to achieve a goal. This Gear Up implied that passion is directly correlated with someones grit. I agree with this theory however in the sense that if you are passionate about achieving something of importance than you will find the grit to get past all the more trivial pieces you encounter along the way that you may not enjoy.

#### Cold Outreach‚ùÑÔ∏è
* Emailed David Rudder(VP Engineering AutoPay) We met for coffee and discussed what they look for in front end developers and discussed some basic interview skills.

* Reached out to Sekhar Paladugu(Turing Alum) We discussed what roles adHawk is trying to fill. He mentioned they are looking for seniors but encouraged that I reach out to the founders anyway.

* Reached out to Tyler Komoroske(Turing Alum) He sent me an employee referral to apply to AllState.

* Emailed Becca Zukowski(EffectiveUI) Inquired about their hiring process and if juniors fit into their business model.

* Emailed a friend of a friend(BlackBaud) received employee referral to apply to interactive designer role.

* Joined Charleston Tech Slack channel and posted I was looking for work. Recieved DM's from multiple people. I prefered this form of outreach. It gave me exposure to companies that I would have never thought to reach out to.    

#### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to David:
David and I have worked together a couple times. Working with David motivates me to work at a faster pace than I normally do. Each time we have worked together I think I have came out of the experience a stronger programmer than when we started. I enjoy working with David and think he has helped a lot of us throughout this program. He is especially strong at cold outreach.

#### Feedback to Kirsten:
Kirsten and I have already worked together a few times at this point. Working with Kirsten has always been a positive experience. I think one of Kirsten's strengths is pair programming. Whether driving or navigating she is always engaged and is a pleasure to collaborate with.  

#### Feedback to Jeff:
Jeff and I worked together on the capstone this mod. Jeff did a great job of bringing organization to our project by encouraging github issues and code reviews requiring 2 approvals. Jeff's PR's are also very thorough and easy to follow. Jeff has been a pleasure to work with at all stages throughout this program.


#### Feedback to Adam:
This was the third time Adam and I have worked together. Adam had prior experience with react native which helped to speed up my learning on this project. I appreciated his willingness to help bring me up to speed and his flexibility when I had schedule conflicts. Overall working on this project with Adam was "super easy".


#### Feedback to Casey Cross:
The capstone was the first time Casey and I have worked together. This project incorporated the most divide and conquer I have experienced. One thing I noticed that Casey did very well was encouraging us to stay organized with github issues and code reviews. I also appreciated Casey's willingness and enthusiasm to forge through testing our app.

#### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Jeff:
Pete it was great working with you on this project as always.  You did a great job of motivating us to get a jumpstart over the break which ultimately lead to us being more successful in this project.  You do a great job of reigning folks in and keeping perspective on what needed to be done when we'd start diving down rabbit holes.  It's been great working with you on various projects throughout the program!

#### Feedback from Kirsten:
This was the third time working together and I feel like we have our methodology of working together down, especially when we‚Äôre pairing. You‚Äôve always been thorough with explaining your thought processes and then writing it in code. All the times we‚Äôve worked together you have always had a flexible schedule and are willing to stay late, which makes working with you easy and our workflow go smoothly. It‚Äôs always great working with you and I know in the future you will be able to fit into any team and they will be lucky to have you as part of their team!

#### Feedback from David:
I have worked with Peter many times now because he is awesome to work with.  He is independent when working on features alone and a great collaborator when working in pairs.  He knows where to look for answers, be it past repositories or online, and is always looking to understand what is happening as goes through a process.  He is always willing to chip in, whether it is adding a feature or assembling tables, and I think that will carry him far.  I look forward to following Pete moving forward.

#### Feedback from Adam:
Awesome getting to work with Pete again and he was great at making sure he was contributing through out the project even though he was going through an interview process at the same time.  He really made sure that he understood Redux and set this up to hold our API information as well as taking on the creation of our graphs.

#### Feedback from Casey:
This was my first opportunity to work with Pete, and I‚Äôm glad I got the chance.  Pete has some solid JavaScript chops. The thing I admire the most about Pete is that he remains cool, calm, and collected even in the face of frustration.  He is always willing to help out another team member.  I would happily work with Pete again in the future.
