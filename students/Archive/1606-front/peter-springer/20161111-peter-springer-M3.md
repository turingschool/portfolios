# M3 Front-end Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn about redux and making
API calls. I also wanted to work on learning ember and
getting more comfortable solving problems more independently
by referencing the docs.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Community

#### Gear Up Reflections

Introversion and Extroversion on Teams: The hiring process can be difficult as an introvert. Often people get chosen to be managers who are unqualified simply because they are extroverts.

Vote Your Conscience: Civic education is often overlooked and should be more widely adopted.

Resilience: I believe resilience is a crucial trait needed to be successful at anything you do. There is no growth without resilience. It is easy to overlook your own resilience and undermine the growth you accomplish while doing challenging things. It can be useful to reflect on it occasionally and recognize the small wins and not just the final outcome when doing something challenging.

#### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to MaryJane:
Working on the weather app with you was a pleasure. You are a strong communicator which makes it easy and enjoyable to pair with you. One thing I think our group did well was rotating who was driving and navigating based on who understood the current issue being worked on. Doing this well shows that you value your partners learning just as much as your own. I would be happy to work together in the future.

#### Feedback to Jeff:
Jeff, I really enjoyed working together on the weather app. I think you do a great job at talking through problems while pairing. I also appreciated your flexibility when it came to deciding when to work. Your patience and communication skills make you a pleasure to work with.

#### Feedback to Paul:
Paul, I enjoyed working with you on remember. We struggled to understand the conventions of ember but were still able to get through most of the issues. You helped to reel me in while researching problems. Instead of just googling to find answers you were diligent about referencing the docs first. I would be happy to work together on future projects.

#### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Jeff:
Pete, it was great working with you and MaryJane on our weather app.  I appreciate you wanting to get together and stay late to work our way through all the new concepts.  I thought we did a good job of working our way through Redux and API calls, and then did a great job of breaking apart to all work on different pieces to get a solid app out the door by the deadline.  Look forward to working with you on future projects.

#### Feedback from MaryJane:
I enjoyed working on the weather app project with you. You always put things in perspective and are able to take the long view. When I got ahead of myself and came to you for help, you were able to slow me down to think about the first small thing I was trying to accomplish rather than my big problem.

#### Feedback from Paul:
Pete and I work on our Remember ember project together. This was the first time we messed with ember and we struggled in the beginning because of all of the black magic happening. We eventually figured it out and it’s great working with Pete because he’s always down to try any solution until we get the right answer. I appreciate him being patient and a good listener when I struggling and going down a rabbit hole.

#### Playing a Part

I supported the larger Turing community this
module by helping mod2 front end students when
needed. Also made an effort to attend more meet ups
