# M2 Front-end Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn about react and build tools.
I also intended to make a conscious effort to focus on workflow
tricks. The latter will follow me into mod3.

### End of Module Assessment

* Functional: 3
* JS Style: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Projects

Listed below are all my projects and scores
from this module.

#### Chat-Room 1.0

Partner: David Kerr

* <a href="https://peter-springer.github.io/chat-room-1.0/">Chat-Room 1.0</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Springer/chat-room-1.0">Chat-Room 1.0 Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html">Chat-Room 1.0 Spec</a>

Chat-Room 1.0 is a project that allows a user to
interact with a chat bot. This was a good introduction
to webpack and designing for mobile first.

Evaluation scores:
#### Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style
Notes: Knock it off with the excessive nesting. Good use of SCSS variables and diving into mix ins. Lenient on nesting due to extra risk taking and diving into sass.

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Testing

 #### Notes: 18 Tests

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### Design

2.5 - needs a pass on color, some tightening up of visuals

#### Tier-Two

* <a href"https://budget-app-f46b3.firebaseapp.com">Budget App</a>
* <a href"https://github.com/Peter-Springer/tier-two">Budget App Repo</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html">Budget App Spec</a>

Tier two was the most challenging project of
the mod. This was our first four person team and
required a good amount of research involving react
and firebase.

#### Tier-two
#### Instructor: Jhun, Brenna (Design)
#### Student: Brett Hevia, Peter Springer, Casey Metz, Kris Foss.
#### Notes:

- spec adherence was kind of soft but they delivered a working application! (i'd use it)
- tests checked for existence and thats about it.
- pumped group took risks

Design
3 - Enjoyed the design choices for landing page, team worked hard to write mobile-friendly markup. Good use of limited fancy-styles ($ amount) and streamline white font. Color scheme on landing page is well thought out. Criticisms fall only on index page where the box size hinders user's view of past purchases. Also red color button is out of place. Would like to see a simplified/easier to view display box (roped into UI score).

3 - User interface could use some clarification. Does it take dollars with or without decimal? When it says "date" can I say "today" or do I need to put in numbers and in what order?

#### Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Risk Taking and Creativity

3.5 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

#### Design

4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html">Shoot the breeze Spec</a>

Shoot the breeze was a fun way to wrap up the mod. I enjoyed being able
to spend more time focusing on react and firebase and less time setting up
build tools. Enzyme testing is still a struggle.

Project: Shoot The Breeze

#### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to David:
We worked together on chat-room 1.0. I think we were able to work very effectively as a team and produce a solid project. I was impressed by your ability to solve problems quickly and willingness to implement new things we learned immediately. Based on our instructor feedback I would suggest that one area of improvement might be design/styling.

#### Feedback to Kirsten:
Working with you was a pleasure. We spent the majority of the project working on features together which I think benefitted both of us. I would say that one of your strengths is keeping your calm and not appearing to be frustrated when we couldn't solve a problem. Also your styling skills were far superior to mine. My only feedback to you would be to not hesitate to ask for help sooner when you do get stuck. Sometimes it just isn't worth burning three hours if someone near by can help you understand a problem in one hour. Overall I think we worked great together and I would be happy to do it again.

#### Feedback to Brett:
Brett and I worked together on the Tier-Two project. Having a four person group allowed for a decent amount of divide and conquer. Brett's willingness to research unfamiliar concepts and help other teammates understand them made him a pleasure to work with. When we found ourselves burning down our project and basically starting from scratch Brett did not hesitate and viewed it as a learning opportunity. I would be happy to work with Brett again.

#### Feedback to Casey:
Casey and I spent many hours together this module. His organization, focus
and calm demeanor make him easy to work with. I find Casey to be a strong problem solver that I  enjoy comparing approaches with. One thing I really appreciated while working with Casey was his discipline to map out a plan before diving into
a project. I look forward to the next time Casey and I get to work together.

#### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Casey:
I’ve worked with Pete on the last two projects of the mod, and it’s been great. We both have an easygoing style and pace, and similar standards, which is nice since pace and standards differences have usually been the hardest parts of pairing. He’s a good coder and encourages us to forge through the less glamorous parts of products (mobile styling, testing, etc.). He’s easy to work with, cares about details, and cares about his group-mates and their learning. Even though we’ve been stuck together for 3 weeks, I’d be super excited to pair again anytime.

#### Feedback from Kirsten:
I really enjoyed working with you on our Palmodoro. We had great workflow, communication, and collaboration. Even though we were always together working on the projects, for the times we were separated at night thanks for being so quick and responsive on Slack. Having a partner that communicates effectively throughout a project is very important to me and you upheld that standard. Whenever we were stuck you would take a step back and rethink the logic. Considering that both of us aren’t the best at math, this was really helpful in setting us in the right direction. I think we’re strong at different languages, but we were able to learn from each other’s strong points. Your JS is stronger than mine, but I was definitely able to learn and grow from your problem solving. When I didn’t understand something your explanations were thorough and concise. When we were struggling you were resourceful and would reach out to others for help. I could have been more resourceful with asking people because usually I tend to  gravitate to researching online first. Since you specified you wanted to develop stronger SASS skills in our DTR maybe you could have done more driving with that, but hopefully you were able to grasp it more from seeing it in action from our project. Otherwise, after all our struggling with math and webpack issues with gh-pages we created a functional pomodoro that I’m proud of, great work!

#### Feedback from Brett:
I worked with Pete on our Tier-Two project (budget app). This was our first time working with a (relatively) large group, and I think Pete’s pragmatism and ability to separate the stuff we could focus on from the stuff we SHOULD focus on repeatedly kept us from getting too far off track. We were also all learning React and Firebase for this project and he was willing to just try stuff and get outside his comfort zone to find out what did and didn’t work. I’d happily work with Pete on future projects.

#### Feedback from David:
Had a great time working on chatroom with you.  I appreciated your desire to approach the project as a learning opportunity rather than one where the grade was the goal.  Because of that, I felt we struggled through some issues which made the following weeks easier on me.  You also took care of the only thing which made our styling remotely palatable with the conversation bubbles, which I still am not sure I understand!  For improvement, we could have done a better job putting ourselves in the users shoes to clarify some rough patches in the ui.

#### Playing a Part

I supported the larger Turing community this
module by helping mod1 front end students when
needed. Also David Kerr and I ran a student led
session about AXE testing using the chrome extension.
