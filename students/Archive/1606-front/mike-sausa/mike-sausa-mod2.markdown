(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

Throughout the first module, I completed 5 major projects
completed portfolio work, and did various mini style projects.

#### Portfolio

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/Portfolio)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

This was our first project after an introduction to HTML, and CSS. We were to create a personal portfolio to display the projects we would make, as well as provide our information and social media. There were many design aspects to this project, and responsiveness was also a requirement.


#### Chatroom Adventures

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/chatroom-adventures)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html)

For this project we built a simple chatroom. Users were able to chat only with a robot that responded with the same message seconds after the intial one was sent. Our main goals were to engage in true test driven development, become better acquainted with build tools, design it ourselves, design it with mobile-first in mind, and make it accessible.

#### Pomodoro

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/pomodoro)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

This project implemented new application ideas to similar concepts we had encountered earlier in the mod. Adam and I built a pomodor app that allowed for the input of rest and task times, and implemented a timeout to count down. We also implemented sound in this app for the first time - playing beeps for the last 5 seconds of each countdown. Our focuses were:
      Be test-driven
      Use build tools
      Be designed by the student
      Use a mobile-first approach
      Be accessible

#### Tier Two Project (IdeaList)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/Gains)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

This project was our first three-person project, which was evident by the larger scale compared to previous projects. The expectations for design, planning, and user experience were set much higher. We created a fitness tracking app, and while we came well short of our initial plans, it was a very valuable learning experience.

#### (React Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/number-guesser-react)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

This project was a simple number guesser built with React. The goal was to cement our React knowledge for evaluations, which was very helpful. One thing I could have improved upon was breaking things out into components - something I would do in the following projects.

#### (Gametime - Snake)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blakeworsley/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

We made a conscious effort to break things out into many smaller components for this project. The app was a chat app in react with firebase on the back end. We ran into some issues when we deployed to firebase - something we will definitely do earlier going forward, but otherwise this was a very valuable project for increasing our knowledge of React.

### Giving Feedback

Adam - Adam was awesome throughout our Pomodoro app and was extremely flexible in a situation where I was unable to be present for a weekend. His design and styling skills are awesome and I really appreciated him taking the reigns there. It was also really helpful to pair with him and walk through the logic for our app as we complemented eachother’s knowledge quite well. Adam was really fun to work with and always brought good cheer and vibes to the table. I really enjoyed working with him and hope we get to do it again in the near future!

Blake - Blake is the man. I’ve immensely enjoyed working with him throughout the last two projects, and commend him for picking up the slack of my limited knowledge. He’s a great teacher, and is always quick and effective to explain concepts that I am slow to understand. Blake is also incredible at progressing development and taking the reigns to keep the ball rolling. Definitely one of the easiest people to get along with, and always brings good vibes to the table. It’s been really cool seeing Blake progress with his React knowledge and it’s clear he’ll go on to do great things. Overall really enjoyed working with him!

Madison - Madison was an incredible partner to have. It was extremely valuable for me to pair with Madison, and served as an excellent learning experience to truly cement concepts that I had previously found rather difficult. Her exuberant attitude was always a welcome sight that never failed to cement our group together. She was excellent at planning and progressing the development of our app, and her superlative sass skills really allowed me to get a better understanding of styling. I continually find myself coming (perhaps to her dismay) back to Madison for guidance, and am ultimately thrilled to have her around. She’ll do great things!

Casey - Mike was a great project partner. I feel like he picked up a lot of slack as my energy lagged towards the end of our chat project. I was surprised at his styling chops, and he took on a majority of bringing out wireframes into reality. Sometimes I was worried that I got too tunnel-visioned into our javascript and deprived him of coding opportunities—I hope that wasn’t the case. I’d encourage Mike to make sure to speak up/take on the tasks that are outside his comfort zone, even if it’s only ‘driving,’ to continue growing his comfort level. Overall working relationship seemed pretty seamless, and I’d be happy to work together again.

### Being a Community Member

From Blake - Mike, you are a great partner who I have thoroughly enjoyed working with through the last two projects. I have found that you speak up right when I am not understanding something and are great at helping solve difficult problems. I think you are great group mediator and have a special skill when it comes to lightening the mood. In terms of advice, I would say to keep on working through the javascript and improving. You’re seem to be doing a great job and I really appreciated having you as a partner.

From Madison - Be like Mike. I admire Mike's ability to balance health and academics and his dedication to both. His light hearted and upbeat attitude during our project was extremely refreshing. I was impressed by his mental malleability. He was able to adjust his thinking to different problem solving approaches that best fit the particular context at hand. Mike was also vocal about when he didn't understand a concept, which benefitted the whole group, myself in articular, by uncovered incorrect assumptions. Mike was a great partner to work with and I look forward to working with him in the future.

From Adam - I worked with Mike on our Pomodoro application.  It was pleasant to work with him and he did a lot of work on the Javascript on the application which gave me time to focus on the design and css for the project.  He really focused on understanding the functionality behind the application which helped us finish the project on time.  He was gone over the weekend of the project and his only opportunity was reaching out more while he was gone, so that I understood where he was at during the weekend.  Otherwise he did a lot even though he was attending a wedding and put us in a good spot when he returned.

### Playing a Part

* Ran 4 introductory CSS sessions at lunch
* Actively spoke to classmates about their projects and offered assistance where I could
* Met with mod 1 students to assist with projects
