#Mike Sausa - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### (What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

  * Improve Javascript fundamentals
  * Gain a better understanding of React
  * Become proficient in Ember
  * Become proficient in Redux
  * Learn about APIs


## Group Work & Projects

### Project Name
Weather app

### Intro
For this app, we got our some of our first experiences with calling APIs and implemented Redux for the first time.
Redux proved to be a steep learning curve for us, but by the end I felt like I was better acquainted with it.


### GitHub URL

### Original Assignment
Description - In this project you’ll be building a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.

Evaluation Scores -
Spec Adherence: 3
Redux Architecture: 4
Routing: 3
JS Style: 3
Testing: 3
Workflow: 3

### Project Name
RemEmber

### Intro
For this app we got an introduction to Ember. We also did other things that I'm currently
unable to rememberize.

## Individual Work & Projects

### Project Name
Memory Palace

### Intro
  For this project I created an application to produce a memory palace (essentially visual
  flashcards with mnemonic devices ) using react, redux, router, and firebase.

### GitHub URL
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html

### Original Assignment
The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.

# Professional Skills

## Gear Up

### Session name - Vote your Conscience
This session was interesting. It was cool to see which celebrities supported the candidates
and speculate how their support would influence people's decisions in voting.

### Session name - Resilience
This session was cool. It was interesting to see how resilience affects those
who are brought up in tough situations. Though resilience can be taught I think much of it
is also natural.

### Session name - Introversion
I enjoyed this session. As someone who feels both introverted and extroverted at times
it was interesting to see how others react to these same feelings. Introversion seems
to be a blessing and a curse.

# Feedback and Community Participation

## Feedback from me

### Kyle Misencik

I was really happy to get to work with you again! The first go around (snake) was interesting, and the weather app seemed to go a little more smoothly. You seemed to really grasp the material quicker than some of us, which was great for moving the app forward, and I think the turning point was with the work you put in on Sunday before the due date. We might have started out slow learning Redux, but your ability to dissect it and get help really helped the group. Was awesome working with ya, hope to do it again!

### Brett Hevia

Brett and I worked on our weather app together. Brett is a quick learner and was great at taking the lead and explaining new concepts to the group. He excelled at steering our project and made an otherwise difficult learning experience manageable for us. Would definitely like to work with Brett again. Brett was a pleasure to work with. His boyish charm and infectious charisma are matched perhaps only by those of Justin Timberlake. His ability to kick people’s asses was a welcome addition to an otherwise soft group of individuals, and though you would never guess it, Brett has been to China. On a scale of human decency Brett comes in at a solid 87 out of 100.

### Casey Cross

Casey was a delight to work with! Her superb testing skills allowed us to produce efficient code and were a very welcome addition to our group. Her attitude was great throughout despite us having some difficulty learning the necessary material to produce our app. Casey (and everybody else - myself included) seemed to struggle a little bit with Redux, but I’m sure she will be more comfortable with it upon revisiting it. All in all, Casey was so fun to work with and the thought of potentially not working with her again makes me want to exercise my newly implemented right to legally euthanize myself. Thanks Case!

## Feedback to me

### Kyle Misencik

Feedback for Weather App -  Enjoyed working with you as always. Considering this was a 4 person project I think we all pitched in & worked together well. Your ability to take issues & knock them out quickly is a testament to your problem-solving skills. The one thing I think you (& I) still struggle with is recognizing when we don't know what we don't know & asking for help. Otherwise keep up the good work - hope to work with ya again!

### Brett Hevia

I worked with Mike on the first project of the module. This was our first time working with a large group, and I think Mike’s willingness to experiment and ability to stay positive was super important to our group’s success. I’d happily work with Mike on future projects.

### Casey Cross

This was the first time I got to work with you and I found you very easy to work with.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job at keeping a positive attitude as we encountered obstacles.  You made me feel comfortable asking questions and commiserating on our frustrations.  You stayed calm and steady even when stuck and frustrated while still trying to stretch your knowledge and skills.  My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

## Ways you supported the larger Turing community

      (said things)
  * Coordinated and executed the accelerated transportation of goods between the bank
    and Gusto that were essential to the learning of students at Turing
