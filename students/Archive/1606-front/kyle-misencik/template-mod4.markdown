### Projects

(Intro)

#### (JetFuel)

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/kylem038/jetfuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

This project focused on creating our own backend using an Express app & persisting data using MongoDB.

Spec: 30
UI: 5
Testing: 5
JS Style: 8
Workflow: 10
Bonus: Got MongoDB working

#### (Imposter Syndrome)

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/blakeworsley/electron-color)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

This project focused on building an Electon App. Blake & I chose to recreate the classic color picker app.

Feedback from Blake: Kyle, this was by far my favorite project that we have worked on at turing and I genuinely appreciate your organizational and project management skills. They have definitely helped us achieve success in the many projects that we have worked on together.

#### (Curiously Native)

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/kylem038/native_nasa)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/curiously-native.html)

This project focused on building a React Native App. MaryJane & I visualized data from Nasa's meteorite API.

Feedback from MaryJane: I enjoyed working with you to learn React Native. It was a fun project to be completely mobile and we both seemed to pick up the syntax pretty quickly. I think it worked well - once we had the basic architecture set up - to break up the rest into sections. I was impressed with how quickly the bulk of the project was finished, which gave us more time to work on the data visualizations and refactoring the code.

#### (Capstone)

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/git-in-the-game)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

This project focused on building an Electron menubar app in React with Redux. We hit Github's API & created a goal tracker by visualizing Github data.

Feedback from Blake: Kyle - You are going to make an excellent project manager with the work that you have been doing. You were not afraid to jump into any problem and answer difficult questions. I am impressed by your fearless approach to coding.

Feedback from Casey: I worked with Kyle on two projects this mod: Jet Fuel and the Capstone Project. In general, I've been super impressed with Kyle's growth as a developer and team member over the last seven months. Two notable strengths that I respect are: 1) his ability to manage group productivity and hold us accountable for goals, pushing a project forward, and 2) his ability to not get stuck on something too long. Kyle strikes a good balance of trying to figure it out, researching it, then asking for help. This is something I struggle with, so I'm going to take note of Kyle's skill at using human resources to solve problems, and how much better than works than tunnel-visioned brain-racking.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

Priorities: Location, Pay & Mentorship

I'm not too worried about the job search at this point. Sure the barrier-to-entry in development is high but by using networking & a little hard work I believe I can be employed within a month of graduating.

Six cold outreach emails have been sent (confirmed with Meg).

### Gear Up
Resilience: When I first read about this topic I immediately thought about how I’ve been able to clearly tell how certain students I’ve shown me how much more resilient they are than me. I’ve looked to try & mimic that (albeit unsuccessfully).

Not everyone’s life is easy, but at one point or another we all face adversity. Making it through that challenge often gives you new insight on life, decision making & more. Knowing that you can face a challenge & have the confidence to know you’ll overcome it, like they said in the articles, can often be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Those who believe they can do, & those they don’t won’t.

So I think the 3 main things that I saw in the article that can increase / decrease resilience include:

1. Your mindset - are you negative or positive
2. Understanding that the situation can change vs. thinking things will always be the same
3. Prevent / allow that build up of narrowly focusing on one negative thing to cycle in our minds.

Microaggressions: Subtle stereotypes exist & have existed well before we were even born. To think about this it means that we’ve been brought up in a culture that created an environment we’ve been unknowingly absorbed & almost have been programmed into. Not talking about it doesn’t help, for sure, but to the point of some of the articles it makes it feel like you’d be better not off engaging with anyone who you might offend for fear of hurting someone you never meant to hurt with a saying you never knew enforced something you never knew existed.

If I simply read the articles then yes, micro aggressions are exactly what I thought they were. I think Allison’s remark about the ‘offender’ in a micro aggression isn’t actively trying to offend someone is key here.

My main question is are we blowing something out of proportion? Is simply being made aware of this issue enough for it to be self-correcting?

Grit: Yes - & I’ve seen how ‘grit’ as its been defined here can affect the outcome of many situations. Take health, many people will cite your approach to a health problem as one of the most important factors in defeating something like cancer.

This approach or ‘lens’ is definitely helpful. I know once I’ve had what seemed to be an insurmountable problems & overcame it that this could be applied to almost any scenario that seems too hard.

I think it depends on the situation at hand. I think many of the glorified stories we hear these days are often of the underdog. The person no one said could do ‘that thing’ & they end up doing it. That being said, they are outliers. The very fact they succeeded against such odds is the good part, but they don’t talk about the others that tried, failed & gave up. Sometimes giving up is good as well. It frees us up to find that next passion that we can fail at.

Honestly I feel I’ve had more passion than most when working on projects here at Turing. Really until this final project I’ve felt that I could learn something or get something out of the current project at hand. I don’t think I would have continued if I didn’t love what I’m learning here.

I think question #2 is an interesting one because as developers we’re interested in pushing the boundaries of what technology can offer. At the same time businesses are pushing back - they want stable technology that can stand the test of time. I think it’ll come down to not particular the stack I’m working in but whom I working in it with.

For question 3 I think Turing has given us an excellent network for which to bounce ideas off of.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Casey: I enjoyed working with you again Casey! As far as our first backend project went I thought we were able to get a functioning Express server up & running in no time. I always learn something new when I'm working with you. You have a unique insight that allows you to find just the right solution / approach for any problem we're facing. You're a kickass programmer & I look forward to seeing what you accomplish outside of Turing.

Feedback to Blake: I feel like I've worked with you more than any other person here at Turing. We've come a long way from LinkedList. I think this
project showed truly how far our understanding of programming has
come (even if we just used jQuery). I'm excited to see what's to
become of this app if we can get it out the door. I think you're
a better programmer than you give yourself credit for & I look
forward to seeing you create some badass apps outside of Turing!

Feedback to MaryJane: I enjoyed our first time working together MaryJane! I feel this project was one of those rare times where anything we approached
worked on the first try. I also feel like we both took steps
forward in being able to manipulate data coming from an API as
well as furthering our understanding of Redux. You've turned
into one hell of a programmer & I look forward to seeing what
you accomplish outside of Turing.

Feedback for Mike: I always enjoy working on projects with you Mike. I think we find that right balance of having fun & getting the job done at the same
time. You're always willing to jump into any problem & help which
has formed you into a well-rounded programmer. This project was
challenging in that we tried a lot of things that didn't end up
working out. I think that's a good lesson to learn as we head out
of Turing. Can't wait to see what you do when you get out of
Turing - keep up the hard work!

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

As I leave Turing I'm happy I got involved in this community. I hope to be a mentor to Turing students in the future. I also did my first student led session this mod. I also look forward to having more time to connect with developers outside of Turing as well as attend more meetups.
