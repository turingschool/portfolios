# (Kyle Misencik) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In mod 3 I was looking forward to conquering some code challenges, exploring new frameworks & further cultivate my skills as a programmer in general. I feel like I've accomplished this as I've really started to get a handle on React as well as the benefits Redux provides. I'm still very interested in MVCs like Ember & Elm & would like to create a basic app in one of those MVCs over the break.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (JamFinder)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/amplify)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

A project of our own choosing. Decided to try & solve the problem of musicians wanting to find like-minded people to play with & possibly form a band.  

Still having problems with naming consistency & when to use plural vs. singular names. Over-engineered some of my components but overall kept things modular. Well organized using waffle.io.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Weather Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

This project focused on hitting an API, customize which endpoints we hit & display the data using React / Redux.

Focus on consistent naming. Go beyond shallow testing. Commits need to be more descriptive. Do not merge with console logs & debuggers.

Spec: 3
Redux: 4
Routing: 3
JS: 3
Testing: 3
Workflow: 3

From Mike: I was really happy to get to work with you again! The first go around (snake) was interesting, and the weather app seemed to go a little more smoothly. You seemed to really grasp the material quicker than some of us, which was great for moving the app forward, and I think the turning point was with the work you put in on Sunday before the due date. We might have started out slow learning Redux, but your ability to dissect it and get help really helped the group. Was awesome working with ya, hope to do it again!

From Casey: This was the second time I got to work with you.  Your ability to seek guidance from your mentor and other people when you need to is something I need to emulate.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job of trying to separate out functionality but still maintaining a cohesive project as well as maintaining a good attitude even when things were really tough.  You have definitely improved on handling frustration since the first time I worked with you.  My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

From Brett: I worked with Kyle on the first project of the module. Kyle took the initiative in the setup phase of the project (Waffle, initial repo, etc…) and was really focused on maintaining scope over the course of the week. He was super open to collaboration while also being willing and able to take things on himself when it came time to divide and conquer, which is a very difficult balance to maintain. We sort of communicated kind of fitfully as a group at times, but I think that’s something that we’re all still learning how to do. I’d definitely work with Kyle again, he’s a super solid programmer with a great sense of humor.

#### (Remember)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kylem038/1606-remember-6)

This project focused on building an Ember app, including an understanding of how routes, models & controllers all interact.

Feedback from Adam: It was very pleasant working with Kyle on the Remember Ember App.  I think it was great that when we started the project that he wanted to TDD the app instead of creating the app and testing after we finished an issue.  If Kyle had an opportunity it would be to sticking to the idea of TDD as we both got caught up fixing the issue before we made a test, so just making sure that he was talking up about sticking to the game plan throughout the entire project.  Otherwise he was a great partner and helped a lot when we were reading the docs and helping talk through the process of figuring out how to successfully apply the docs.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

The main thing I took away from this gearup is that I'm not alone in my thinking of how broken some of our government / political systems are. Especially after this election there is definitely a need for change in our country. I hope to play a bigger part in our local government to demand change where it has the best chance of coming to fruition.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

The main thing here is how often introverts are forced out of our optimal working conditions because of the extroverted nature of business today. We need to be able to tailor our work conditions based on what makes employees most effective at their jobs, not based on what has become a social norm. I'll keep this in mind as I head out into the workforce.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This was interesting in that it posed that resilience is something that can be learned. I agreed more with the second article, as the first article didn't really describe how resilience can be learned & more talked around the subject. Either way I think we all agreed that making it through tough times takes a mindset that can be learned. If you can maintain that mindset you can weather very hard situations.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Brett: Enjoyed working with you on this one. Your understanding of redux not only helped us complete the project, but also really helped me understand the benefit of what redux provides. You're also a natural leader & your get-things-done attitude will get you far. One thing I noticed is your tendency during pairing to grab the keyboard once you realize how to get something to work. I think the benefit of pairing is, if you're not driving, conveying to the other person what is needed in a way so that they can get things working. Otherwise I'm looking forward to seeing you continue to be a bad ass programmer. Hope to work with you again!

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

I wasn't able to pair as often as I'd liked to this mod. I did post in the pairing Slack channel & paired twice with mod 2 students & talked through React, managing state & how to pass props.
