# Kyle Misencik - (M2)-FE Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I'd like to continue to become a well-rounded FE developer. This module I definitely got a better at understanding and writing tests. Working with Ben on the Pomodoro app helped a ton. Additionally, I wanted to push my logic skills & focused on completing CodeWars challenges outside of class. I felt I drove a lot this module & proved I can take concepts & implement the functionality.

### Giving Feedback

Blake Worsley - Feedback on Chatroom Adventures: Really enjoyed working with you again Blake. I still have much to learn from your design / CSS skills. We put in a lot of hours on that project & I’m proud with how it turned out. It’s one of the first apps I’ve shown off to my friends / family. I really believe you’re a very well rounded FE developer, although I know sometimes you underestimate your own abilities. One thing I think both of us can get better at is breaking bigger problems down into smaller ones. Sometimes all it takes is a debugger / console log in the right place to get things moving when you’re stuck. Definitely won’t hear me complain if we get paired again!

Tex Bodfrey - Feedback on Pompodoro: Really enjoyed working with you on this project Ben. I know I drove through a lot of this project & I appreciate you being cool with that. You’re a really solid developer & we would’ve been in trouble without some of your last minute coding skills. At the same time there’s a lot I think we can both improve on. I’d definitely be down to work through what Taylor helped us with & really understand how to pass everything we need to separate work clocks from break clocks. Hope to work with ya again in the future!

Jeff Duke - Feedback Tier-2: I truly enjoyed working with you on the Tier-2 project. I learned a ton from your approach to problem solving. Your ability to recognize that problems needs to be further broken down is something I hope to emulate as I continue to code. I often take pride in giving constructive feedback, but in this case I say keep doing what you’re doing. You’re elevating everyone in our class & I hope you continue to do so. Hope to work with you again!

Kirsten Swanson - Feedback Tier-2: I truly enjoyed working with you & Jeff during this two week project. Your positivity is infectious, and during those days in the basement it helped us push through on some very stubborn problems. I also noticed how, if you didn’t feel you understood something, you’d take charge on that task. Finally, your work ethic is unparalleled & I feel we all have much to learn from you. I usually pride myself on giving constructive feedback but in this case I say keep pushing forward in the fashion that you are. If you do I think you’ll make a name for yourself in the coding community. Hope to work with you again in the future!

### Being a Community Member

Kirsten Swanson - It was great working on this two week project with you Kyle, especially since you’re probably one of the most organized people that I know! Your waffle.io skills keep you on track and because of that our group was extremely organized and well structured. From the very beginning with the wire-framing and user stories we had a direction and end goal to reach due to your organization. When we were struggling with React communicating with Firebase you were determined to make it work and kept on trying different approaches to solve the problem. I think it’s great you experiment with code even if you’re not sure if it’s going to work, but the fact that you try regardless is motivating. Drives me to try to just write code more even if I’m not sure if it’s the correct solution. The only constructive feedback for you would have been to practice some SASS skills since you had mentioned that as a weakness in the DTR. I typically volunteer to work on CSS since I enjoy it so much, so I apologize if I took control, but I just wanted it to get done. Once again you have a strong work ethic, which makes you a reliable team player and a great individual to work with!

Jeff Duke - Kyle is what good working with you on our project.  It was interesting to work on a project with 3 people for the first time and I thought we all worked well together.  I thought it worked out well that if one of us was missing the other two were able to keep working.  Also I thought we had a good mix of pairing when needed and divide & conquer when we could as well.  Overall this was one of the best apps I’ve put out in any group.  For actionable feedback for you I’d say maybe a little less pessimism?  Sometimes even if something doesn’t seem like it’ll work out, it’s still worth doing as it leads to the right answer.  Good working with you and I look forward to working on future projects together!

Blake Worsley - Kyle, it was great to have the opportunity to work with you again this mod. I know we had both given each other feedback from last mod, and I really feel that this was an even better and smoother project then last time. You are diligent about managing the process and keeping us on track on Waffle.io. I know that I had suggested that you let me drive a bit more this time and I appreciate you taking that to heart. All in all I think it was a great project and I had a great time working with you.

Gabi Procell - Kyle has been a huge help with my OOP woes during mod 1. I often have a hard time navigating through my code when relationships become very complicated, and Kyle served as a sherpa to explain why I was having errors with my code. Also, explaining the concept of webpack was an enormous help. He's always been very approachable when I did not have him scheduled from pairing, and is eager to help.  Thanks again!

### Playing a Part

I really enjoyed pairing with mod 1 this time around. It's great to work through a complex problem and see the lightbulb go off. Additionally, not only was I able to help other students but pairing helped me cement some concepts that I didn't know I needed to work on. I look forward to continue helping both Mod 2 & the new Mod 1 next mod.
