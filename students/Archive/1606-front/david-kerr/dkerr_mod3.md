# David Kerr - M3 - FE Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module my plan was to make my code more polished, focus on doing things the right way rather than just doing them, and refactoring for clarity and simplicity.  In learning front end frameworks, I wanted to understand them conceptually rather than just understanding how to use them.

### Projects

#### Weather-Forecast

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

Made a react/react-router/redux application accessing the open weather API and the Google location API to access weather for current cities, provide extended forecasts when requested, and allow for users to pin cities to their dashboard.

* Spec Adherence: 3
* Redux Architecture: 3
* Routing: 3

##### Feedback from Brittany:
* Add lifecycle method to React component
* Call API with an action creator

* Workflow: make sure to use WIP and add description
* Workflow: use assign portion of GitHub

#### Thoughts
I was very frustrated after spending several days unable to map anything into components.  I should have put up a pull request early, but didn't know if the issue was due to my lack of understanding of redux or that package itself.  By the end, I felt comfortable with redux just because I had struggled in futility for 3 days.

From Madison - David, I really enjoyed working with you. I like how you work to break down and understand problems efficiently and effectively. I learned a lot from your thought process. It was awesome getting to bounce ideas off of you and work through code examples to better understand redux. Although I wish I could have contributed more, I felt that our group did a good job of dividing and conquering. In the end, was impressed by your ability to wrap your head, so quickly, around such a complicated subject matter like redux. I hope we get the chance to work together next module!

From Blake - David, you were wonderful to work with on this project and were definitely helpful in terms of explaining difficult to understand concepts. I have truly learned a lot from you and appreciate the time you have given to teach. I don't have any glaring things to work on, all I would suggest is you continue to be patient and understanding like you are.

From Ben - I really enjoyed working with David on our Weather App. He had a great work ethic when it came to this project. Despite us struggling, David was always quick to offer up ideas and potential solutions to the problems we were facing. Another great part of working with David was that he’s very good with doing research on his own to understand the topic at hand. Since we were working apart for most of this project, this attribute really helped us when we all had the chance to come together.

One area of opportunity for you David would be to continue to work on explaining things that you understand. You can absolutely crush code at this point, and also seem to understand the topics extremely quick, so I think that if you can master explaining the concepts as well, it’ll allow you to help everyone around you as well. I had a great time working with you though and hope we have the chance to work together again!

#### Ember Reminder List App https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-1)
* [Original Assignment]()

Made and ember application to create and store reminders for a user.  The purpose of this project was to practice git workflow, learn proper pull requests, have in depth conversations during those code reviews, and force us into this workflow with centrally managed issues.  

We closed 9 issues which represent incremental feature additions.  We had 3 pending pull requests at the end to close 3 more issues, but we closed this project a day early to provide more room for personal projects.

From Jeff - David, it was awesome working with you on our Ember project.  It was one my favorite projects so far, both because of the project structure and also how we worked together.  I thought we did an awesome job of popping back and forth to make commits and solve problems while still working together to resolve user issues and get the code pushed up.  I thought we did a great job of pairing and dividing/conquering.  I don't really have any constructive feedback, I thought we both did a good job and the project ran really smoothly.  Look forward to working with you again.

#### Thoughts
The workflow on this project was awesome.  I still do not feel comfortable with gitHub entirely, but gained an appreciation for why honing those skills is so important.  I would have liked to see this continue for another day or two, but everyone was clamouring to start personal projects.

#### (Selc Directed Project) Twitter User Analytics

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/social-feed)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Made an application which accesses the twitter API to do analytics on a given users use of twitter.  It has an express server running to meet CORS requirements and properly attach authentication headers to API calls.  Inside the application, I used react and react router and chartjs to create charts for those calculated data points.  The app updates with a new username and has minor UI pieces to make those transitions smoother.

####Thoughts
Personally, I am not entirely pleased with how I finished this project.  There are some rough patches (like hashes in the url, improper routes) which I would like to iron out.  I would also like to push this to a Heroku app so anyone can use the app.  I intend to revisit this project with other APIs as well.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Blake on Weather-App: Blake, it was a pleasure working with you on the Weather App.  I remember being mentally exhausted on Sunday of this project and getting slack messages from you and Ben about what you were trying, what you had heard, and just being impressed at your willingness to push your way through those adverse situations.  You have an incredibly positive attitude a genuine interest in learning, which makes working with you a great experience.  Hope this isn’t the last time!

To Ben on Weather-App: Ben, I had a great time working you on this project.  The project itself was brutal so its hard to provide feedback, constructive or otherwise, but I appreciated that you were not on your phone very often throughout the project.  You are always looking to keep the project moving forward you can and have a good sense for when its time to ask for help.  Looking forward to working with you in the future.

To Madison on Weather-App: This was by far the most frustrating project we have had yet(my opinion), and I felt your positivity and can-do attitude really carried our team.  There were points when we were all scratching our heads and you would find another path to push forward.  That positivity really lifts up the group you are working with and empowers them to take the same initiative.  I was also impressed by your desire to understand and learn rather than just do the thing.  Those things together are a pretty great combo, so I hope to get the opportunity to work with you moving forward.

To Jeff: Jeff, this project went smooth as silk.  On top of your obvious talents as a programmer, you are incredibly patient, a great listener, and very good at explaining what you are thinking.  That makes working with you delightful.  No constructive feedback for you either!  I would love to work with you again in the future.

#### Gear-Up Reflections

Resilience - I didn't find this gearUp frustrating because resilience is a prerequisite to getting this far in Turing.  The one positive I took away is the point that what matters about a situation is how our brain records that experience, because those experiences are information our brain uses to make future decisions

Introvert vs. Extrovert - I really dislike these binary categorizations when it comes to something as complicated as people.  That being said, I feel we had a good conversation about whether or not Turing was being inclusive to each of these personality types.  Doing this Gear-Up within our group led to some pretty great conversations.

### Playing a Part

I continue to be active in our community as someone who helps others with issues.  While my formal participation has dropped (didn't run any posses or Friday spike sessions), I attended every gear-Up (except for the an excuses absence for a flight to Seattle) and participate openly and enthusiastically in those events.  Additionally, I started tutoring a woman Kris met at Girl Developer It 5 hours a week to help her learn javascript.
