### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 4 the goal we had discussed was to continue to polish my code and focus on best practices.  I am quick to solve problems, but too quick to move on from those problems after solving them.  I think I improved in this regard

### Projects

#### Jet Fuel

Partner: MaryJane

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/url-shortener)

##### Points
* 67/100

##### Feedback from Steve:
* Would have liked to have seen the project deployed.

##### Thoughts
Could have done better on this project.  I was personally over-intimidated by the idea of deploying, which given the simplicity of the app would have taken no time at all.

##### Feedback from MaryJane: Working with Mary-Jane is always a pleasure.  Not only does she make you feel inadequate by beating you into school everyday despite the longest commute and children at home, but she also maintains incredible focus in the time she is there in working through problems.  I was impressed at her willingness to ask questions, particularly of teachers, when we were stuck.  She has a good sense of when struggling with a problem is constructive, and when it becomes a waste of time.  Regarding code, we were both struggling through the specifics of express, but were able to move forward together by talking through issues.  Mary Jane is a joy to work with and I hope to have the opportunity again in the future!

#### Imposter Syndrome

Partner: Pete

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/electron-project)

##### Points
*169/175

##### Thoughts
The experience working with both Vue and Electron was awesome.  It forced me to draw parallels to react, which deepened my understanding of front end frameworks in general.  I was proud to get this thing deployed (at the compact size of 500mb).

##### Feedback from Pete: David and I have worked together a couple times. Working with David motivates me to work at a faster pace than I normally do. Each time we have worked together I think I have came out of the experience a stronger programmer than when we started. I enjoy working with David and think he has helped a lot of us throughout this program. He is especially strong at cold outreach.

#### Curiously Native

Partner: Jeff Duke

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/HoopDreams)

##### Points
* 167/175

#### Thoughts
Great experience working with Jeff on this project.  I remember at one point being frustrated at not having the time to build a more complete application, but that made this a great transition into the final project.

##### Feedback from Jeff: David, it was great working with you on the Capstone project and our React-Native projects.  You're a super strong developer and I think we work really well together.  I always know I can bounce ideas off you and we can come to a quick solution to any problem.  It's been great working with you throughout the program.  I hope we get the chance to work on projects together after Turing!

#### Final Project

Partners: Casey, Kirsten, Pete, and Jeff

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/HoopDreams)
* [Production](https://turing-fridays.firebaseapp.com/)

##### Points
* 313/325

#### Thoughts
It was nice to complete something a bit more polished.  Along with that came an appreciation for what a pull request in the real-world would look like where things don't move as quickly and must be meticulously reviewed before they are merged into prod.

##### Feedback from Casey: This was my second opportunity to work with David.  David has incredibly strong JavaScript skills and picks up concepts very quickly.  I really appreciate that David is always willing to stop what he’s doing to help another teammate out when they are struggling.  David has a lot of strong opinions, as do I, so occasionally we butt heads, but we are always able to eventually come to a mutual and amicable agreement.  I look forward to seeing what amazing things David accomplishes in his professional career.

##### Feedback from Kirsten: This was the first time that David and I have worked together. I was really excited to work with him because I had heard good things about pairing with him. His ability to quickly solve problems is inspiring and I hope I can someday think as quickly as him. I enjoyed watching him problem solve and listening to him explaining his logic. He acted as a leader at many times by organizing and facilitating tasks for our team. For example, during our snow day he coordinated a Slack meeting to make sure everyone was assigned a role. One of his many strengths is his sharing of knowledge by his willingness to help others. Not only does he do this with his team members, but I constantly see him offering his time to help others within the community. David has a bright future ahead of him and I’m excited to see where he lands after Turing!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Pete: I have worked with Peter many times now because he is awesome to work with.  He is independent when working on features alone and a great collaborator when working in pairs.  He knows where to look for answers, be it past repositories or online, and is always looking to understand what is happening as goes through a process.  He is always willing to chip in, whether it is adding a feature or assembling tables, and I think that will carry him far.  I look forward to following Pete moving forward.

To Jeff: Jeff's programming ability is embodied by the magnificent beard that rests upon his chin.  Rugged yet elegant, durable and distinguished, Jeff work is timely, clean, and professional.  
Joking aside, he would be the ideal teammate because he genuinely cares about whatever he is doing.  That innate sense of pride in his work mirrors who he is on a larger scale.  Jeff is one of those guys you would pick to be in a fox-hole with you, and I think that says it all.

To Casey: This was by far the most frustrating project we have had yet(my opinion), and I felt your positivity and can-do attitude really carried our team.  There were points when we were all scratching our heads and you would find another path to push forward.  That positivity really lifts up the group you are working with and empowers them to take the same initiative.  I was also impressed by your desire to understand and learn rather than just do the thing.  Those things together are a pretty great combo, so I hope to get the opportunity to work with you moving forward.

To Kirsten: This was my first time working with Kirsten.  Her work ethic, persistence, and positivity brings together and motivates a team.  In other words, just by being herself she is a massive contribution to any team.  That can-do attitude carries over to her work where combined her attention to detail, she is efficient, clean,  and organized.  For a group project with pull requests requiring detailed reviews, she was always finding issues and bugs which would have caught up to us later. She always had a resource tucked away to save our group time, which I hope to emulate after seeing the time it saved.  If I could offer one piece of constructive feedback, it would be to try to use past repositories in the same way as documentation of how you did something previously.  Kirsten is the model team member and I would consider myself lucky if I get the opportunity to work with her again.

### Being a Community Member

#### Gear-Up Reflections

Micro-aggressions - I found this gear-Up particularly frustrating but had a nice conversation with my group, and Allison, about the subject.

Journey Mapping - This was a constructive thought exercise to think about a process from the perspective of the customer, understand the pain points in the process, and build solutions around those pain points.  

Grit - Interesting discussion around the general subject of what makes people more resilient than one another.  One student in our group had gone through a period of self-doubt early in mod-4 and shared what pulled him through, which shifted my perspective on the subject.

### Playing a Part

I continue to be active in our community as someone who helps others with issues.  While my formal participation has dropped (didn't run any posses or Friday spike sessions), I attended every gear-Up and participate openly and enthusiastically in those events.  I continued tutoring a woman in JavaSript roughly 6 hours a week, which was admittedly as beneficial for me as it was for her.

### Notes

I attempted to engage in shaping the program but feedback was met with resistance and a dismissive tone by the organization.  I feel institutional defensiveness poisoned my Turing experience, culminating in a conversation with Jeff Casimir on Wednesday morning in which he told me he doesn't care about the specifics of the situation, and that if I didn't submit my emails (by the deadline which had not yet passed) I would be asked to drop out.  I mentioned my correspondence with Meg laid out my timeline and I might need an extra couple days to complete, given the constraints of the final week.  He pressed his original point about the value of cold outreach making it clear he was not hearing me when I said I hadn't missed any deadline and the issue was that we were having this conversation in general... After participating in multiple demo nights and actively participating in the community, I felt incredibly disrespected by how the situation was handled.  Students, in a position where they have already quit jobs and taken out loans, have little to no leverage in these situations.  To the student, it feels like bullying.

I will submit my emails by Sunday, likely Saturday, maybe tonight if I have time.  

I am eternally grateful to the staff, particularly the Front End staff who put together over 7 months a top notch curriculum. Constantly listening to feedback, understanding that nothing is perfect, and working tirelessly to give us tools to make us successful.  Sorry for not making this process easy for you guys, but I really appreciate you putting up with the headaches.

### Outcome

Pending - 3 emails
