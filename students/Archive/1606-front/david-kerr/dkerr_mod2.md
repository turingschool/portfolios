# David Kerr - M2 - FE Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My intention for this module was to build on the foundation from mod 1 and become a well rounded FE developer.  Essentially, the goal was to learn to use these tools better and develop a specific area of interest or expertise.  While I do not have an area of particular interest, I gained the ability to self teach which will be invaluable moving forward.  Notable feedback coming out of mod 1 was that I should focus on refactoring, which has gotten better but still has room for improvement as we find quicker more efficient means to the same end.

### End of Module Assessment

With Brenna

Progression/Completion : 3+ - Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
JavaScript Style : 3 - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
Workflow : 4 - Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development
Collaboration : 4 - Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## Team

### Projects

Below are my group projects from module-1.  At first glance, this module doesn't appear to have covered the ground of the first module.  Looking deeper it is clear that our progress this module is less visible as we get more comfortable with things like databases and lightweight js frameworks.

#### A Very Lonely Chatroom

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/chat-room-1.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html)

Made a basic chatroom app, linked to firebase and complete with a not so articulate robot to answer your lonely messages.

Specification Adherence : 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
User Interface : 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
HTML Style : 4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
CSS/Sass Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
Notes: Knock it off with the excessive nesting. Good use of SCSS variables and diving into mix ins. Lenient on nesting due to extra risk taking and diving into sass.
JavaScript Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing : 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
# Notes: 18 Tests
Workflow : 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation : 3 - Five or fewer complaints
Design : 2.5 - needs a pass on color, some tightening up of visuals

From Peter - We worked together on chat-room 1.0. I think we were able to work very effectively as a team and produce a solid project. I was impressed by your ability to solve problems quickly and willingness to implement new things we learned immediately. Based on our instructor feedback I would suggest that one area of improvement might be design/styling.

#### (Tier-One) Pomodoro App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/pomodoro-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

Made a customizable pomodoro app which allows users to customize work length/breaks, label time blocks to help box time, and indications when those timers are ending.

Specification Adherence : 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface : 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
HTML Style : 4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
CSS/Sass Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
JavaScript Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing : 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
Workflow : 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation : 3 - Five or fewer complaints
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
Design : 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

From Blake: David, I really learned a lot from working with you and had a lot of fun. It was nice to be in a project environment where there was no clashing. I felt like we sailed through the project and you did a great job explaining some of the time concepts that I found difficult to understand at first. I do not have much critical feedback because it went well. I think in the future, stopping and refactoring is an important step that we could have spent a bit more time on. All in all, great working with you.

#### (Tier-Two) Networking App
TODO
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kccrs/networking)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

Created a networking app using strictly react, linked to a firebase db with user authentication.  Users can add contacts, information about those contacts, and tag them for follow-up if necessary.  This project was an introduction to React.

Had blueberries, wanted to share. - Louisa

Specification Adherence : 3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Risk Taking and Creativity : 3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.
Design : 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
User Interface : 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
HTML Style : 2.5 - Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.
CSS/Sass Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
JavaScript Style : Soft 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing : 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.
Workflow : 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation : 3 - Five or fewer complaints
The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

From MaryJane: I learned a lot working with you on this project. I appreciate that, even though you moved pretty fast through things, you took time to make sure we all understood what was going on. I think talking through the logic of everything is very helpful to keep the team on the same page and moving forward.

From Casey: I worked with David on a group project creating a networking app.  David is very sharp and a quick learner.  His brain works very rapidly and thus his coding is also very quick, but he is always willing to stop and explain his thinking, even several times if need be.  My constructive criticism is that because David conceptually gets some concepts quickly, he sometimes will shut down other partners ideas because he understands they will not work.  In my particular learning style, I need to try things and see them break before I understand how they work correctly, and it was hard to do that sometimes on this project.  But overall David is a great partner.

#### (Shoot-the-breeze)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/react-chatroom)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Created an open chatroom (authenticated with g+) using React.  The goal of this project was to split this relatively basic app into many components to reinforce fundamental React concepts.

Specification Adherence : 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Component Architecture : 3 - Application is broken in out into at least 8 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.
User Interface : 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
CSS/Sass Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
JavaScript Style : 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Giving Feedback

To Peter on A Very Lonely Chatroom: Had a great time working on chatroom with you.  I appreciated your desire to approach the project as a learning opportunity rather than one where the grade was the goal.  Because of that, I felt we struggled through some issues which made the following weeks easier on me.  You also took care of the only thing which made our styling remotely palatable with the conversation bubbles, which I still am not sure I understand!  For improvement, we could have done a better job putting ourselves in the users shoes to clarify some rough patches in the ui.

To Blake on Tier-One: Hey blake, here is some feedback for our pomodoro: Your obvious strong point is styling/CSS (it was helpful watching your process w/ slack), but aside from that your positive energy and ability to discuss code are invaluable on a team.  Covered by self deprecating humor, those strong communication skills ensure that the entire team understands the what and why of what they are doing.  Thats really valuable, and your positive attitude really drives the group.  We also took some time to discuss what we wanted and what we needed from an object standpoint which helped us be successful as well.  As far as areas of improvement, I think you could get comfortable working with arrays by doing exercises like code wars as we have to deal with larger and larger data sets.  Had a blast working with you.

To Casey Tier-Two: Hey Casey!  Here is some feedback for your portfolio from our work together on the networking app.  Your SASS skills are on point.  This will be the project I continue to go back and reference for requiring, organizing, and importing SASS files, so thank you for that.  You were incredibly flexible and a great communicator, making working with you easy.  As far as areas for improvement, I think we were all trying to figure out what was going on with react… so I would only say that we could have made our lives easier with a group of 3 with a group list of remaining tasks.  I enjoyed the project and think it went well!

To MaryJane Tier-Two: You must have a blackbelt in time management.  I don’t understand how you could be so diligent with so many commitments going on outside of turing, but you are.  I think part of that is that you don’t waste time on things that don’t matter.  We would get off course, and after letting us (me?) wander aimlessly for 10 minutes you would tactfully get the group back on track.  I think we could have done a better job of keeping track of tasks and managing group work flow, but we were too busy scratching our heads with react and didn’t even know what our to-do’s were.  All in all, it was a pleasure working with you.

### Playing a Part

I am an engaged community member, leading an student led session using aXe testing tools to remove issues on a website, participating formally in code-pairing sessions with 1608, and most importantly informally being a go to person within our group for help.  I attend all extra curricular events, have skipped 2 Friday gear-ups due to workload(both unrelated to turing) and or family visiting which required time prioritization as well.
