# Ben Godfrey - M1 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 1 were to further my fundamental knowledge of web development.<br>
I came in having some minimal skills with HTML, but after the Mod I've developed my soft skills, learned several different programming languages, and my communication while working through problems. I still need to work on skills involving my workflow.

#### End of Module Assessment

I maintained a 3+ average.

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

The Number Guesser is a game were the player picks a number between 1 and 10.  
The computer will let you know if you're too high or too low.
Once you win, the game will change the limits and make the game higher.

**My Number Guesser:**  
- https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/number-guesser
- https://bcgodfrey91.github.io/number-guesser/

**Original Requirements:**  
- https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/number-guesser.md

**Scores: (0 to 4)**  
Functional: 4  
JS Style: 2.5

Feedback from David Kerr:
> Based on the limited information we had available, I feel like we made that project as easy as possible.  I think all points of reflection come back to refactoring (i.e our feedback on the problem) which at this point is moot since we knew 5% of what we know now.  You felt you were struggling or behind in the moment if I recall, but made sure that you were comfortable with everything in that project before moving forward which I thought was a great habit.

#### Link List

The Link List allows you to create a repository of all of your favorite websites.

**My Link List:**  
- https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/linky-list-1

Feedback from Casey Cross:
>  I worked with Ben on the Linked List project.  I found him easy to collaborate with and our skills complemented each other well.   He does not give up in the face of frustration as we both had issues getting CSS to behave properly but he persevered.  I would happily work with Ben again in the future.

Feedback from Adam Bernard:
> I think overall we worked well together although we did have our struggles at the beginning of the project, we pulled it out by the time it was due.  As for an opportunity, I would say that you shouldn’t second guess yourself and try things and don’t worry if they fail the first time.  You had some great ideas that worked out really well. I know it came down to the wire to finish the project, but it turned out great and you did an amazing job at refactoring the code.

### Giving Feedback

To David Kerr on Number Guesser:
> Although this was our first pairing project, and we had all barely known each other for a week, I felt that David and I worked very well together. While we got the project to work fairly quickly, our main errors lied in refactoring. Throughout the project, David was great to work with. He was very quick to pick up the concepts and “make the thing do the thing.” In addition, any time I had an trouble understanding where we were going or what we were doing, David was patient and made sure he explained the concept to the best of his ability.

> If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to continue to work on explaining the concepts at hand. Since it was our first project, I’m sure you’ve gotten better at this already, but you really are insanely smart and adept at picking up these concepts, so if you can eventually explain the concepts at that same level then you’ll be absolutely killing it.

To Casey Cross on Linked List:
> Casey was fantastic to work with. She was very flexible when it came to scheduling, super easy to work through problems with, and I think our personality/work types played off of each other really well. Even when we’d get annoyed at CSS or jQuery not working, Casey always kept her cool and her sense of humor, which made me much more accepting of the situation as well. I would love to work with Casey on another project.

> If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to not be afraid to speak your mind. Since this was only our second project, I’m sure you’ve gotten better at this already, but you came up with some great ideas during our time working together, and, to be fair, ended up fixing most of the problems we had as well. So whenever you have an idea brewing, definitely don’t second guess on it!

To Adam Bernard on Idea-Box:
> I really enjoyed working with Adam. He had a great vision of where we needed to go with the project, and was very determined in making sure we had approached a problem from every angle before we got frustrated. Even when we’d get stuck on a problem for an entire class, Adam was very persistent in trying to find the issue, which made our dynamic work very well.

> If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to focus in on one small problem at a time. You were great at analyzing where we needed to go and what the project would look like overall, but sometimes we would both get caught up in looking at the entire project, rather than moving along with the smallest possible part. Once you get this down then you’ll be killing it!

To Andy Young on Lights Out:  
> Andy was awesome to work with. He always had a great attitude when working on Lights Out, even when we were entirely lost in the woods, which definitely rubbed off on me. He was also okay with letting me drive for long periods of time, which was a great experience because I had never actually done that in previous projects, so I really appreciate it. He was great at giving and taking feedback, and you could tell that he gave and took criticisms very intently and never made them “personal.” He was always willing to make adjustments for both of us when the time called for it.

>If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, Andy, it would be to not be so hard on yourself when you’re lost in a problem. Throughout our whole project, I could tell you actually knew more about the problems at hand than you gave yourself credit for, but sometimes it just took us taking a breath, getting away from our desk, and going on a walk before we drove ourselves crazy. I know you’re going to be killing it with VIM in the next module so you’ll be flying through stuff, but I’d encourage you to work on keeping up your Pomodoro count and keeping a positive inner thought process!

### Playing a Part

So far I've done the following within the community:
- Attended multiple meetups.
- Attended Improv outside of the required times in class.
- I've helped backend students work with JavaScript.
- I've also helped front-end students figure out issues they were having with their projects.
- Met and spoke with developers outside of the Turing community.

### Soft skills
**DTR memo for Game Time:**  
Schedule Expectations:
- Ben and I favor afternoon and evening hours to work. Weekends are available as well.
Communication Expectations:  
- We prefer direct communication or DM in Slack.
Abilities Expectations:  
- We are both on par technically.
Workload Expectations:  
- We are fluid in our approach to building the game. Neither of us are coerced into any given scheme.
Workflow Expectations:  
- We use github and work so close that we didn't need to use waffle.io or any other workflow tool. We could use github issues to clue each other to the latest stories.
Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  
- We are pretty direct (friction-less) with our feedback. Though when we finish we may take a few hours to decompress then compile our end of project notes.
Agenda to discuss project launch:  
- We were pretty fast and loose with when to launch. It's just hard to set the right expectation when we're still learning. That being said, we chose to work on the hardest problems first, so that we could relax and devote time on styling. As luck would have it, we were able to stick to this strategy, and deliver on schedule.

## Review

### Rubric Scores

- **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

- **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3

- **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3

- **D: Community Participation**: 3

- **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3

### Notes

overview: expectations, knew some HTML. Expected it to be like a 60+ hours a week job, seems accurate. No curve balls, has been a new way of learning but once got used to it it’s been good.

idaebox was confusing, lots of `for` loops which was confusing.

Staff: technically there, really easy to work with, take feedback and direction well. Very open to constructive criticism, is kind and patient with everyone.

community: went to some meet ups, found out about turing from david baker at the ember meet up, feels like a part of the basement, likes to be around the backend students and helping them out out.

### Outcome
PASS
