# Ben Godfrey - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 3 were to further my fundamental knowledge of JavaScript,
as well as develop new skills in regards to Redux, Ember, and API calls.<br>
After reflecting on the mod, I still feel some what shaky in regards to Redux,
but feel much more confident in my Ember and API skills. I would still like to
focus on networking and on becoming more involved in our community.

#### End of Module Assessment

I maintained a 3+ average.

### Projects

#### Weather Forecast

Weather Forecast was our first opportunity to work with Redux and API calls.
The purpose of the app was to generate up-to-date weather predictions for a given
area, and to then manage our state with Redux.

Feedback from Blake Worsley:
> Ben, you are a wonderful light hearted gentleman and I cannot tell you how much of a light you were for me in this project. When ever I struggled you were there. I appreciate you as a person and am forever in your debt for the time you have taken to teach me valuable lessons. Keep working hard and you will accomplish your dreams.

Feedback from David Kerr:
> Ben, I had a great time working you on this project.  The project itself was brutal so its hard to provide feedback, constructive or otherwise, but I appreciated that you were not on your phone very often throughout the project.  You are always looking to keep the project moving forward you can and have a good sense for when its time to ask for help.  Looking forward to working with you in the future.

Feedback from Madison Kerndt
> Ben, I was so impressed by your consistency and determination to understand Redux. Out of the whole group I think you spent the most dedicated time and gave Redux the most concerted effort out of all of us. Although we all struggled on this project, I was so impressed by everyone's hard work, yours especially, to understand the problem at hand. It was really awesome getting the opportunity to talk through problems, theorize solutions, and work with you. I hope we can work together again in the future.

#### Remember

Remember was our first project that dabbled in Ember. Our goals for this project
was to get a better understanding of Ember-Data, as well as solidifying our knowledge
of how to set up and Ember app.

Feedback from Mike Sausa:
> Really enjoyed working with you on this project Ben. I know I drove through a lot of this project & I appreciate you being cool with that. You’re a really solid developer & we would’ve been in trouble without some of your last minute coding skills. At the same time there’s a lot I think we can both improve on. I’d definitely be down to work with you again in the future!

#### Personal Project

For my personal projects, I created an Ember app and an Express server. The goals
of this project were to consume the Twitter API, and render analytics using
Ember-Data and Highcharts.

### Giving Feedback

To Blake Worsley on Weather Forecast:
> Blake was awesome to work with on our Weather App. He was very encouraging when I wanted to explore new ideas. He was great at giving and taking feedback, and offered a lot of perspective on how we could approach Redux (even though we were all struggling). Maybe it’s because he’s a former Olympian, but Blake is an insanely hard worker, and consistently tries to push forward even when he doesn’t understand things. He was always so considerate and vigilant to make sure we were all holding up alright, given that this was a very frustrating project for most of us.

> Blake, the biggest thing I would say you could work on is to not get so down on yourself. I’ve seen you get much better at this from Mod 1 to Mod 3, but I still think you’re much smarter than you realize, so you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself when you don’t immediately understand a concept. Once you master that, you’re going to be an absolute savage. I really enjoyed working with you and hope we get another chance to do so in Mod 4.

To David Kerr on Weather Forecast:
> I really enjoyed working with David on our Weather App. He had a great work ethic when it came to this project. Despite us struggling, David was always quick to offer up ideas and potential solutions to the problems we were facing. Another great part of working with David was that he’s very good with doing research on his own to understand the topic at hand. Since we were working apart for most of this project, this attribute really helped us when we all had the chance to come together.


> One area of opportunity for you David would be to continue to work on explaining things that you understand. You can absolutely crush code at this point, and also seem to understand the topics extremely quick, so I think that if you can master explaining the concepts as well, it’ll allow you to help everyone around you as well. I had a great time working with you though and hope we have the chance to work together again! next level.

To Madison Kerndt on Weather Forecast:
> I had a great time working with Madison on our Weather App. She had a great approach to planning out the app, as well as making sure we set cohesive goals for our group. Madison was also very easy to communicate with, and a great source to bounce ideas off of as well. Lastly, Madison was awesome when it came to working independently. This was one of the major goals of the project and, despite not being together for a lot of it, she was always grinding to get the next thing working or to figure out the next piece of information. I really appreciated this when it came to working with her.

> One area of opportunity for you Madison would be to drive more often when it comes to pairing. You're extremely skilled and articulate when it comes to communicating the ideas you'd like to try and the concepts you've already gotten, but there were times where I would have loved to see you actually code these things out so that I could better understand your thought process behind things (mostly when we weren't in person). Overall, I had a great experience working with you though and would definitely like the chance to work together again!

To Mike Sausa on Remember:
> I really enjoyed working with Mike on our Ember app. He had a great work ethic when it came to this project. Mike was very persistent when it came to trying to fully understand the concepts of Ember and how it works. He was also very dedicated to keeping us on track when it came to PRs and making adjustments based on our critiques.

> One area of opportunity for you Mike (and probably myself as well) would be to take a break from coding once you’ve been banging your head for a while. There were things that came up that we would get super frustrated with and I feel like we both could have used breaks at that point, but we’d keep banging our heads, which just led to us getting more frustrated. That being said, I would love the chance to work with you again!

### Gear Up
* [Vote](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
I was concerned that this session was going to be overtly political, but I found it very interesting to discuss different views on how important voting is in a society.
* [Introversion](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
After this session, I find myself teetering on the line between extrovert and introvert. It was interesting to see our class' breakdown of E vs I, and I think it was extremely beneficial to do this Gear Up within cohorts as opposed to school-wide. I will take this session into account when working with other students and coworkers moving forward.
* [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
I was out of town for this Gear Up session.
