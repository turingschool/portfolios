# Ben Godfrey - M3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 4 were to build on my fundamental knowledge of from Module 3,
as well as develop new skills in regards to React Native, Vue, and Electron<br>
After reflecting on the mod, I believe that I was able to build a solid foundation in the previously mentioned skills, as well as continuing to build on what I learned in Mod 3 (especially in regards to Redux). I'm now shifting my efforts to finding a job.

#### End of Module Assessment

I'm going to hit the 1000 point baseline

### Projects
---
#### Jet Fuel

Jet Fuel was our first opportunity as a class to work with Node and Express. The requirements were to build a URL shortener, a-la Bitly.

**Jet Fuel:**  
- https://github.com/bretthev/jet-fuel

**Original Requirements:**  
- https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/jet-fuel.md

**Score**  
- 71 / 100

Feedback from Brett Hevia:
> He graduated.

#### Imposter Syndrome

Our second project was geared towards a focus on Electron. Jeff and I ended up using Vue.js as our web technology, and used both of these frameworks to create a music player.

**Amptron:**  
- https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/amptron

**Original Requirements:**  
- https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/imposter-syndrome.md

**Score:**  
- 132 / 175

Feedback from Jeff Duke:
> Ben, it was awesome working with you on Amptron.  I thought we did a great job of working together.  We came together to tackle problems and did a great job of dividing & conquering tasks to get a pretty cool app put together in a short period of time.  I'm stoked to work on getting our NPM package published.  I hope we get to work on some projects together after Turing.  I'm glad we got to work together on a project!

#### Curiously Native

For our React Native project, we made a mobile app that consumed the Product Hunt API and returned a list of top results for the topic the user searches for. It also creates three data visualizations based on the results returned.

**Curiously Native:**  
- https://github.com/madison-kerndt/native

**Original Requirements:**  
- https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/curiously-native.md

**Score**  
- 117 / 175

Feedback from Madison Kerndt:
> Ben, you always get shit done. There is no messing around with you. I admire how resourceful you are. I felt at times that he pushed past some valuable learning opportunities, but I was impressed by your ability to create and end product and our first React Native app. Aside from that your creativity and passion for art is AWESOME! Keep it up!

---
#### Capstone

For our Capstone project, we created an Electron app that displayed a users results from GitHub for the week, and compares them to the previous week. We used React for our web technology and Redux for our state management.

**Capstone:**  
- https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/git-in-the-game

**Original Requirements:**  
- https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/capstone.md

**Score**  
- 260 / 325

Feedback from Mike Sausa:
> I was really happy to get to work with Ben again. He was great at getting the ball rolling and taking charge of our API calls and reduxing. Our group could have communicated more clearly at times, as we we occasionally stepped on eachothers’ toes with the work we were doing, but other than that, Ben’s the man, I’m sure he’ll go on to do great things!

### Giving Feedback

To Brett Hevia on Jet Fuel:
> None.

To Jeff Duke on Imposter Syndrome:
> I really enjoyed working with Jeff on our Electron app. He had a great work ethic when it came to this project. He took the time to research several potential technologies for us to use to actually play our audio files, and, once we settled on one, absolutely POWERED through writing promises to make it all work. This was the first project I've done that I thought we truly worked great together, regardless of if we were in person or remote, which was great. Jeff is a savage with the code and I would love the chance to work with him again.


To Madison Kerndt on Curiously Native:
> I enjoyed getting to work with Madison for a second time. Once again, she had a great approach to to planning out this app. It was also really great to see how much she's improved from the beginning of Mod 3, and how intent and interested she still is when it comes to soaking up as much information as possible. Aside from some scheduling issues we had, I think that Madison and I worked very well together. She's such a driven individual, I can't wait to see what she accomplishes throughout her career.

To Blake Worsley on Capstone:
> I always enjoy the opportunity to work with Blake on projects, and I think a big reason for that is that we both have different interests in what we like to focus on for a project. What I loved seeing from Blake this time was his determination to work not only on design, but also on data visualization. It was something that he had never done before and I think his contributions to the design and function of those visuals were one of the few bright spots on our capstone. I think Blake and I compliment each other very well and I can't wait to see what he accomplishes in the field.

### Community/Playing a Part

I've done the following within the community this module:
- Attended multiple meetups.
- Attempted hosting a meetup.
- Putting the finishing touches on an NPM package.
- Thanks to Steve, got to discuss career opportunities with developers in Austin.

### Gear Up
* [Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)
This was really interesting because the focus of my group was how we got to Turing. I enjoyed this primarily because I was the only FE student in my group, so it was eye opening to see that I had almost the exact same reasons for choosing Turing as BE students, despite being in different programs.
* [Micro Aggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
I was sick and not able to attend this Gear Up session.
* [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
For similar reasons to Journey Mapping, it was great being able to interact with backend students in order to figure out what their most trying moments were.

### Cold Outreach ⛄️

- Emailed Alysha Cooke at P2Binvestor. She just got a promotion but said she would get back to me when her schedule calms down. I plan to follow up with her soon.

- Reached out to Bob Timm at Bottle Rocket. Despite both going to college together (however, we did not know each other), I still have not heard anything back.

- Reached out to Eric Brown at Ilumi. No response.

- Planning on emailing some developers at Genius. I'm very interested in their FE position that's open, so I want to do everything I can to put my best foot forward.

- Discussed an opportunity to work with an old colleague from high school. He is looking for FE developers at the new startup he is working for in Dallas. The role sounds interesting, but the team seems far too small for what I'm looking for.

- Joined Dallas Devs Slack channel and posted I was looking for work. Recieved DM's from multiple people. I have a phone interview with one of these companies, Axxess, next week.
