# Ben Godfrey - M2 Portfolio


### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 2 were to further my fundamental knowledge of JavaScript.<br>
I came in feeling like my skills weren't very refined, but after the Mod
I've become much more confident in my abilities. I feel like I can approach any
problem thrown at me in the languages and frameworks we have learned so far.
I now need to start focusing on networking and on becoming more involved in our
community.

#### End of Module Assessment

I maintained a 3+ average.

### Projects

#### A Very Lonely Chatroom

The Very Lonely Chatroom was a web application that created a mock chatroom using
local storage. While it only had room for one person, we implemented the ability
to have a 'bot' respond to our users.

Feedback from Andy Young:
> Ben is the Ambassador of Awesome! Let's get real. I love Ben. He truly cares about his colleagues. He has a diplomatic style that's enviable.
I've witnessed him working with vexatious persons, under tight dead-lines, and still keep his cool while crushing project milestones.
He has been the voice of reason for me on more than one occasion. He's not timid in handing out the unvarnished truth. For some this is difficult, yet Ben seems to handle difficult situations with his own brand of finesse. He has my vote for SAB, and when he gets in, his ideas and voice will shape Turing for the better.

#### Tier-1: Pomodoro

For our Tier-1 project, we, like the rest of the class, chose to do a Pomodoro. The app lets you set a desired amount of time to work. It will let you know once you are within 20 seconds of finishing your work time, and, once completed, will create a similar timer for your break.

Feedback from Kyle Misencik:
>  Really enjoyed working with you on this project Ben. I know I drove through a lot of this project & I appreciate you being cool with that. You’re a really solid developer & we would’ve been in trouble without some of your last minute coding skills. At the same time there’s a lot I think we can both improve on. I’d definitely be down to work through what Taylor helped us with & really understand how to pass everything we need to separate work clocks from break clocks. Hope to work with ya again in the future!

#### Tier-2: Networking App

The Networking App we created is intended to be a useful app you can use at meet ups or other events to take down contact information for new people you've met. It allows you to add, delete, and edit contacts, as well as mark which contacts you want to follow up with. It is actually connected to a database for storage.

Feedback from Adam Bernard:
> This is the second time I was able to work with Ben and I think it went just as well as the first time.  He was a huge help on rendering items to the page and helping with the functionality of React.  He also had a huge impact on our overall design on the application and gave really great ideas on how the app would function.  His only opportunity was that  he could easily be distracted by his phone and would we would need to grab his attention again after.  Otherwise he was a huge help and it was great that he took time on the first Friday to sit down and learn React so he could explain things to Paul and I.

Feedback from Paul Nguyen:
> Ben and I worked on our Networking App in module 2. This was the first time I was paired up with Ben and it was our first project with a group of 3. Our DTR are awesome, we set our goals that we wanted to accomplish and I believe we did everything we wanted to do. He’s an active communicator and was willing to stop and explain his thought process before we moved on to the next challenge. It was amazing to see him enter the matrix and knock out problems after problems in react. He definitely was seeing code. I would definitely work with him again and can’t wait to see what we create next.

#### Shoot The Breeze

Shoot The Breeze was a further iteration on the chatroom we built at the beginning of the Mod. It connects to Firebase and allows multiple user to join and chat all in the same place.

Feedback from Kirsten Swanson:
> I had a fun time working with you! It seems like you have a pretty solid understanding of React, so thanks for explaining concepts to me. After watching you code I learned to just try something, even if you don't know if it's going to work. Awesome job with Enzyme testing, especially since we haven't done that kind of testing before. Also I really appreciated your help with preparing for the final assessment. Thanks for sharing your time to help me and others with that preparation. My only constructive feedback is that sometimes it seemed like you were distracted by other things, so sometimes when I was communicating with you I wasn't sure if you were listening. Eye contact would have helped to show that you were engaged. But otherwise it was great working with you and we killed it!

### Giving Feedback

To Andy Young on A Very Lonely Chatroom:
> Andy was awesome to work with the first time, and equally as awesome to work with the second time. He let me drive for long periods of time, which was a great experience because I felt like I was lacking in skill coming into this Mod. He was great at giving and taking feedback, and offered a lot of interesting ideas on how we could go about making and designing the app. He also came up with a super cool ‘bot’ response functionality for this. Andy is an insanely hard worker, even when he doesn’t understand things, he tries to catch up and understand them and could usually end up explaining the concepts better than me (regardless of who wrote the code). Lastly, I would venture to say that Andy has the highest EQ in our entire class. He’s alway so caring and thoughtful with any actions he’s taking, and that made it a joy to work with him for three weeks straight. Andy is definitely the homie.

> For Andy, the biggest thing I would say you could work on is the way you approach problems. From all the time I’ve spent working with you, your knowledge of things is not even remotely an issue, but the way you approach problems could stand to change. As soon as you start approaching problems with an “I’m going to crush this, even if I don’t fully get it yet” attitude, you’re going to have some INCREDIBLE growth as a developer. I genuinely cannot wait to see you hit that next level.

To Kyle Misencik on Tier-1: Pomodoro:
> I had a great time working with Kyle on our Pomodoro app. Of all the people I’ve worked with, I feel like he and I played off each other’s ideas the best. One thing I also really enjoyed was that he drove for most of the project, which was great because I was feeling extremely burnt out at that time. He also helped me get a much better grasp on ES6 as we worked through the project, and placed a big emphasis on trying to refactor, which was refreshing because I hadn’t really done that before. Lastly, he also had the best process for keeping track of our goals and workflow of anyone that I’ve worked with in my time here. I really appreciated that aspect because he essentially handled that entire thing on his own, but it still allowed me to get an idea of what a truly methodical workflow looks like.

> If there was anything I think you could work on Kyle, it would be to not get too down on yourself. I know we hit a wall for the first several days of our project and it seemed like you were really down at that point, but then we literally turned around on Friday and Saturday and crushed the whole thing in 8 hours. Your knowledge is definitely there, as is the tenacity/work ethic, so if you can work on adjusting your outlook on a project in the face of adversity, you will be a complete animal with the code.

To Adam Bernard on Tier-2: Networking App:
> I really enjoyed working with Adam for the second time. Again, he had a great vision of where we needed to go with the project. He made some insanely detailed wireframes that really helped us lay the framework for not only our design, but also the overall functionality of our app. He also spearheaded the way for us to work with React Router, which I think will definitely pay dividends as we enter Mod 3. He crushed the CSS and had a profound understanding of the concepts we were working with, and did his best to help me understand them as we chugged along, so thank you for that!

> If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to focus on crushing the code. You have some of the best understanding of all of the things we’ve worked with so far this Mod, but it seemed like sometimes you were timid when it came to starting to write the solutions to the problems. Once we started coding, you could certainly hop in and grind things out, but I think you could really take your developer prowess to the next level once you can get over the initial hesitation to start writing things out.

To Paul Nguyen on Tier-2: Networking App:
> I had a great time working with Paul on our Networking App. To start off the project, he had a great approach to planning out the app, as well as making sure we set goals as a group to push ourselves. He continually showed improvement throughout the whole process, going from not knowing anything about react and firebase to helping solve some of our most difficult and complicated problems (as well as allowing us to get anything to deploy to firebase). He was also great to bounce ideas back and forth with. I actually think our group solved a majority of our problems because of Paul (knowingly or unknowingly) forcing us to brainstorm.

> One area of opportunity for you Paul would be to communicate more of your ideas. I know we were approaching A LOT of new material with this project, but the only reason I was able to ‘plug into the matrix’ was because of you talking through things with me. Truly, I think 90% of your ideas were implemented into this project in some shape or form, but I feel like you were somewhat hesitant to throw your ideas out there which caused us to not have as many dope ideas implemented! Some of this may be attributed to Adam and I having very loud personalities, but I’d love to hear more from you in the future if we have the chance to work together again!

To Kirsten Swanson on Shoot The Breeze:  
> Kirsten was honestly so enjoyable to work with, and honestly may have been my favorite partner of the Mod. She was super flexible when it came to scheduling, which made her very easy to work with. In addition, she’s an absolute grinder. Most days that I would reach my breaking point and head out, she would stay later (sometimes even hours later) and knock out big chunks or our project. She exclusively handled the CSS for this project and, as our assessment shows, absolutely killed it. She was always willing to learn and teach, and did a great job of being assertive/expressive when it came to discussing ideas as the project went on, which was something we discussed at Gear Up.

> If there was anything I think you could work on, it would be to just dive into the problems. One thing I noticed was that once we had some lines on the page, you could jump in and make things work with no problem. However, when we were starting with a blank page, you seemed a bit timid to approach the problem. If you can figure out how to get better at this, I have no doubt that you’ll be an awesome developer, because you definitely have the knowledge and work ethic already.
