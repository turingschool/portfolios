### Areas of Emphasis

This module I focused my time and energy into better understanding some of the more complicated aspects of Javascript. I effectively utilized my time to explore more adventurous designs and some explorations into ES6. I cemented my foundational learnings from mod one and began to approach thinking about code differently while working with React. Near the end of the module I started to get comfortable with both React and SCSS. I began to feel like a true developer and I am excited to start taking on more ambitious projects going forward.

After reflecting on this mod I would like to work hard on developing my testing skills next mod. I am excited to work on my personal project and start to put together some of my skills to build something useful that I will use going forward.

>Kyle: Chatroom -
  Kyle, it was great to have the opportunity to work with you again this mod. I know we had both given each other feedback from last mod, and I really feel that this was an even better and smoother project then last time. You are diligent about managing the process and keeping us on track on Waffle.io. I know that I had suggested that you let me drive a bit more this time and I appreciate you taking that to heart. All in all I think it was a great project and I had a great time working with you.

**Feedback**
>David: Pomodoro -
  David, I really learned a lot from working with you and had a lot of fun. It was nice to be in a project environment where there was no clashing. I felt like we sailed through the project and you did a great job explaining some of the time concepts that I found difficult to understand at first. I do not have much critical feedback because it went well. I think in the future, stopping and refactoring is an important step that we could have spent a bit more time on. All in all, great working with you.

**Feedback**
>Madison: Gains -
  Madison, I am so glad we had the opportunity to work together. You are an absolute riot and an idea machine! You have an in-depth way of looking into the bigger picture and making large scale changes that I find difficult to do myself. I think that is a great skill to have and it paid off in our project. Your SCSS work was awesome and made it easy form me to work with the file you created. Sometimes we got in over our heads with big changes that I had a difficult time helping you with because we were changing so much. I think you are definitely capable of doing that, but it occasionally made it hard for me to help because I didn’t know what was specifically wrong. Thanks for being a great partner and I can’t wait to work more on the app!

**Feedback**
> Mike: Chatroom 2 and Gains -
  Mike, you are a great partner who I have thoroughly enjoyed working with through the last two projects. I have found that you speak up right when I am not understanding something and are great at helping solve difficult problems. I think you are great group mediator and have a special skill when it comes to lightening the mood. In terms of advice, I would say to keep on working through the javascript and improving. You’re seem to be doing a great job and I really appreciated having you as a partner.

Feedback on Chatroom Adventures: Really enjoyed working with you again Blake. I still have much to learn from your design / CSS skills. We put in a lot of hours on that project & I’m proud with how it turned out. It’s one of the first apps I’ve shown off to my friends / family. I really believe you’re a very well rounded FE developer, although I know sometimes you underestimate your own abilities. One thing I think both of us can get better at is breaking bigger problems down into smaller ones. Sometimes all it takes is a debugger / console log in the right place to get things moving when you’re stuck. Definitely won’t hear me complain if we get paired again!

>David Kerr
Your obvious strong point is styling/CSS (it was helpful watching your process w/ slack), but aside from that your positive energy and ability to discuss code are invaluable on a team.  Covered by self deprecating humor, those strong communication skills ensure that the entire team understands the what and why of what they are doing.  Thats really valuable, and your positive attitude really drives the group.  We also took some time to discuss what we wanted and what we needed from an object standpoint which helped us be successful as well.  As far as areas of improvement, I think you could get comfortable working with arrays by doing exercises like code wars as we have to deal with larger and larger data sets.  Had a blast working with you.

>Madison Kerndt
Blake is awesome to work with. His up beat mentality and his 'sky is the limit' mentality made our project super fun! He has a way of keeping his code is extremely functional and I admire his ability to jump in and get things working. He always cautions to take small steps(which is something I always need to work on). Also he is extremely visual which helped keep the group on track though the project and also helped us to flush out concepts we felt uncertain about. Ultimately his upbeat mentality, great sense of humor, and kick ass design skills made him an awesome partner. I look forward to working with Blake again in the future.

**Feedback**

>Mike Sausa
Blake is the man. I’ve immensely enjoyed working with him throughout the last two projects, and commend him for picking up the slack of my limited knowledge. He’s a great teacher, and is always quick and effective to explain concepts that I am slow to understand. Blake is also incredible at progressing development and taking the reigns to keep the ball rolling. Definitely one of the easiest people to get along with, and always brings good vibes to the table. It’s been really cool seeing Blake progress with his React knowledge and it’s clear he’ll go on to do great things. Overall really enjoyed working with him!


### Playing a Part

This module I continued my involvement in the community by working with SAB to run events and maintain a good cohort vibe. I actively participated in events on a weekly basis often bringing fellow students along to different meetups and helping expose them to the community. I also spent time every week working with other students and helping them with their projects. It was rewarding and I am happy with my involvement in the community this mod.
