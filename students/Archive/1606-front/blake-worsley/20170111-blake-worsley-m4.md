# Blake Worsley - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to get better to advance my skills solidify my skills in react and get a firm handle on Electron. I focused my time on learning Electron for much of this model and have worked on the side on my first electron project that I will be packaging for distribution.

## Individual Assessment

This module was a good step forward in my development as a developer. I definitely didn't take away everything we learned this mod but I finally felt comfortable in my coding environment and got better at looking at documentation and finding solutions on my own. I am ready to get out in the real work and continue to improve my skills.

* Ben - You were great to work with and instrumental in our work with the API. You proved invaluable to the group when you helped us deploy the project at the 11th hour. Appreciate the hard work.
* Casey - When authentication threw us problems, Casey didn't skip a beat and came up with an ingenious way for us to grab information from github without authentication. Great job. I am excited to see what you accomplish outside of turing in the development world.
* Kyle - You are going to make an excellent project manager with the work that you have been doing. You were not afraid to jump into any problem and answer difficult questions. I am impressed by your fearless approach to coding.
* Mike - It's always great to work with you Mike. You do a great job of bringing the group together and helping jump in and solving difficult problems. Appreciate all the hard work and your testing prowess.

##### Partner Feedback

* Kirsten - I have been looking forward to working with you since we started because of your obvious work ethic and excellent ability to output a great product. I really valued your time and support as we worked through this project. Your knowledge of both React Native and the Unsplash API surprised me and helped to make this project a success. Thank You!

* Personal Feedback - This was the first project that Blake and I worked together on and it was a lot of fun. We were really excited to pair since we had both worked in React Native with our personal projects and we are both passionate about design. It’s inspiring to watch the ideas that Blake creates in Sketch and to see his passion for design really come to life. Yes, Blake is known for having an eye for design, but he also possesses strong JavaScript skills and a resilient drive to solve any problem. I know that Blake has a bright future ahead of him because he is very talented in many ways, whether it’s design, creativity, logic, or determination, he will be a strong member to any team!

##### Partner Feedback

* Kyle - Kyle, this was by far my favorite project that we have worked on at turing and I genuinely appreciate your organizational and project management skills. They have definitely helped us achieve success in the many projects that we have worked on together.

* Personal Feedback - I feel like I've worked with you more than any other person here at Turing. We've come a long way from LinkedList. I think this project showed truly how far our understanding of programming has come (even if we just used jQuery). I'm excited to see what's to become of this app if we can get it out the door. I think you're a better programmer than you give yourself credit for & I look forward to seeing you create some badass apps outside of Turing!

## Professional Development:

The top three priorities in the job search for me start with the location. I would like to stay in the Colorado area and have a very supportive environment for me to foster my growth. I will also be looking for a mid to larger size company.

In order to overcome barriers in my job search, I will be working from a schedule from Monday to Friday and doing side projects for income while I wait. I will be sure to send at least 5 outreach emails a week and attempt to set up a minimum of 3 coffee meetings until I have a job.

## Cold outreach:

* Avi Stopper - Founder at Captain U - Response was that he was no longer looking for a designer but will be looking again next year so he will reach out if needed.

* Sam Lindstrom - Web Developer at CrownPeak. Emailed and met for coffee. Will be interviewing with the company in the new year.

* James Bowman - Director of Eng at Motilli - Emailed and have not had a response yet.

* Collin Donahue - UX Lead at Digital Globe - Emailed and I am meeting him for coffee.

* Jeremy M - Development Team Lead at Map Quest - Met with and has passed my resume out to the community.

* Joe Palatucci - Director of Sales at Digabit - Emailed and he asked for my resume that he will forward on to the hiring manager.


## Community:

This mod, I helped front end students from different mods work on their projects.

#### A recap of reflections from Gear Up

Feedback: Self-solicited and project pairs feedback, plus a summary of how you've contributed to the community.

Micro Aggressions - We had some good group discussions about experiences we have had with microaggressions and learned about what a microaggression is.

Journey Mapping - I found it was helpful to fully understand the experience of something we have done in the past. We chose to look at our DMV experience and how it could be improved.

Grit - I have a lot of experience with Grit in terms of understanding and application so I found this to be a very interesting session. I knew and had seen most of the videos we watched but I took away a strategy for succeeding in the business world.
