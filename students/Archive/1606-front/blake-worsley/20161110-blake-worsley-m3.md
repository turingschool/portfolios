##### Partner Feedback
* David, you were wonderful to work with on this project and were definitely helpful in terms of explaining difficult to understand concepts. I have truly learned a lot from you and appreciate the time you have given to teach. I don't have any glaring things to work on, all I would suggest is you continue to be patient and understanding like you are.
* Ben, you are a wonderful light hearted gentleman and I cannot tell you how much of a light you were for me in this project. When ever I struggled you were there. I appreciate you as a person and am forever in your debt for the time you have taken to teach me valuable lessons. Keep working hard and you will accomplish your dreams.
* Madison, you are a strong and talented person to work with. I really appreciated working on this project with you and getting to see your drive for other personal ambition outside of Turing this mod. I know you will be successful because of you attitude and your commitment to your goal. Keep working on narrowing down focus. Complete one goal before you undertake the next. You have already improved since our last project and I am sure you will continue to improve. It has been an absolute pleasure!



#### (remEmber App)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-4)

Assigned: 2016-10-12
Due: 2016-10-19

The goal of this project was to begin to get comfortable with Ember and understand how it passes data. Testing was a breeze with Ember, but getting started was more difficult than I originally thought it would be.

##### Partner Feedback
* Casey, you have a way with people and are excellent at breaking down complex subjects. I wanted to say it was great working with you and I look forward to doing so again in the future. I appreciated that you had a different method than myself, slow down to speed up, and I have integrated more of that approach after working with you.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)
* [Vote](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
I was very worried that this was going to be overtly political, but I realized the importance of the what it means to vote and I will take that with me and spread that message for the rest of my life.
* [Introversion](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
I would say that I primarily display myself as an extrovert but had some interesting insights in to how I am much more introverted than I previously believed. I think this will be beneficial going forward, as I can use this knowledge to be a bridge to both introverts and extroverts.
* [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
I would often say that I struggle with resilience an it is something that you need to be aware of in order to impact change on. I have set the goal to keep my life in order as I move through some of the more stressful weeks here in Turing.

### Professional Development Workshops
* [Flower Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E6hY4dXb2ynzjE-dDMrx9Zd4JiYqSe-S0Ugo9S2-0V0/pub)
* [Personal Development Plan ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avO9KzhUg6ACsgSNynd5pAmbLReloIOHO0Aa_qicPiE/edit?usp=sharing)

I realized that location is a big factor for me and I am not too concerned with the company I first join as long as they are willing to support me.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I continued to take people to meetups this mod and spent time helping on projects with people in and outside of our mod. I was no longer a part of SAB and found it slightly more difficult to be involved, being away from the rest of the school, but I did my best to help when I could.
