Feedback from partner Mike Sausa:
> Andy’s parent’s should have named him Mandy, because he is the man! His communication is excellent and I felt like we were always on the same page. We struggled through some features, but I think this was due to getting adjusted to the pace of the course. One of the things I loved about Andy was all of the workflow advice and tools he helped me discover, it helped me a great deal and I am still using many of them! Our project was an overall great experience.

Feedback from partner Kirsten Swanson:
> We pushed through this project to make it work! Once you had your mindset on completing a specific task you were driven to solve it. One time you were fixated on some functionality that wasn't required, but I praise you for trying to make it the most user efficient. When you didn’t understand something you did a great job using your resources to find the solutions. You stayed organized with the project by creating a waffle.io and I apologize for not using it. Sometimes I think I should have explained myself more especially with the CSS flex-box for you to understand it better. Don’t be afraid to stop your partner to ask for an explanation. I enjoyed our lunch together and learning about you as a person outside of school. In conclusion, it was great working with you and thanks for being so supportive.

Feedback from partner Brett Hevia:
> Andy and I worked together on Idea Box. It was, in my estimation, the hardest project of the module, but we managed to maintain a positive, collaborative workflow despite the challenges and occasional slow-going. Andy is an understanding and receptive partner who was always willing to listen to me complain and let me talk through whatever problem I was having. We did have a couple of issues with forgetting to merge and pull down the master, but I think those problems are just a symptom of not having much experience with Git and should work themselves out pretty soon.

#### Game Time  

For Game Time my partner and I build the classic game "Lights Out".  
The objective is find the correct pattern of lights to turn off so that all the lights go out!

**Play Lights Out!**  

- https://andy-young.github.io/game-time-starter-kit/

**See the Code!**

- https://github.com/andy-young/game-time-starter-kit

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project.

This project is inspired by [Minicade](http://minica.de/).

<h5>Goals</h5>

* Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Separate business-logic code from view-related code
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

<h5>Restrictions</h5>

You can use any of the following libraries:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
* [Lodash](http://lodashjs.com/)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
* [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com)

<h5>**Scores: (0 to 4)**</h5>  

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
User Interface
* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

Feedback from partner Ben Godfrey:
> Andy was awesome to work with. He always had a great attitude when working on Lights Out, even when we were entirely lost in the woods, which definitely rubbed off on me. He was also okay with letting me drive for long periods of time, which was a great experience because I had never actually done that in previous projects, so I really appreciate it. He was great at giving and taking feedback, and you could tell that he gave and took criticisms very intently and never made them “personal.” He was always willing to make adjustments for both of us when the time called for it.

> If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, Andy, it would be to not be so hard on yourself when you’re lost in a problem. Throughout our whole project, I could tell you actually knew more about the problems at hand than you gave yourself credit for, but sometimes it just took us taking a breath, getting away from our desk, and going on a walk before we drove ourselves crazy. I know you’re going to be killing it with VIM in the next module so you’ll be flying through stuff, but I’d encourage you to work on keeping up your Pomodoro count and keeping a positive inner thought process!

### Giving Feedback

To Mike Sausa on Number Guesser:
> I liked working with Mike because he takes the time to listen. And it’s no surprise that he’s good at teaching! When I was confused, or unsure of what to do, Mike could ask a thoughtful question and help me get back on track. I give much credit for his determination. There were several times when I was tired or frustrated and his good nature and levity eased me down and helped focus ​_my_​ efforts.
Mike knew how to multiply our team’s energy as well how walk away before we burned out. His ability to balance the needs of the project among our many other obligations made the completion of our project possible as well as fun.

To Kirsten Swanson on Linked List:
>I enjoyed working with Kirsten so much! Her ability to be patient and listen to my thoughts and concerns helped me feel confident and effective. In moments of stress she would gracefully guide my efforts back to the project. Her calm and determination kept us productive when most people would have walked away. I learned more than I know in the short time we worked together. I could have asked more questions, and will hence forth. I learned that I can design ​_and_​ code with finesse because I saw Kirsten do it everyday we worked together.

To Brett Hevia on Idea-Box:
> Working with Brett was great. He listened intently to my ideas and shown patience while I explored different ways to build our project. This turned out to be critical to our success. On a few occasions I had adopted a poor strategy that would not have worked, yet Brett was patient and graceful in guiding our efforts so that we ​_could_​ make progress. A word on determination..
Brett’s energy is electrifying! When Brett sets his mind to complete something, it gets done! It was great to see him in the flow, and often inspired me to push a little harder. What I learned from Brett (among many things) is that when I think I’m done, I can still go much further!

To Ben Godfrey on Lights Out:  
> Ben has been great to work with! He’s quick witted and has an awesome sense of humor! He’s also a good listener. A few times I was talking through some hard problems and he listened patiently, helping me verbalize the problem and further my understanding. He also gave me the flexibility to make mistakes, then in a ​_Socrate_​ way, he asked some poignant questions that set me back on track. He shown great patience while I was struggling to learn ​_VIM_​ and ever used it himself! In sum, Ben is fearless. He doesn’t wait around for divine intervention, he experiments until he finds a solution, and this added so well to our momentum. The project was completed on schedule because Ben was creative, diligent and nimble. Would I work with Ben again? Heck Yeah!

### Soft skills

**DTR memo for Game Time:**  

Schedule Expectations:
- Ben and I favor afternoon and evening hours to work. Weekends are available as well.

Communication Expectations:  
- We prefer direct communication or DM in Slack.

Abilities Expectations:  
- We are both on pare technically, and I am working to learn _vim_.

Workload Expectations:  
- We are fluid in our approach to building the game. Neither of us are coerced into any given scheme.

Workflow Expectations:  
- We use github and work so close that we didn't need to use waffle.io or any other workflow tool. We could use github issues to clue each other to the latest stories.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  
- We are pretty direct (friction-less) with our feedback. Though when we finish we may take a few hours to decompress then compile our end of project notes.

Agenda to discuss project launch:  
- We were pretty fast and loose with when to launch. It's just hard to set the right expectation when we're still learning. That being said, we chose to work on the hardest problems first, so that we could relax and devote time on styling. As luck would have it, we were able to stick to this strategy, and deliver on schedule.


### The Well Written ReadMe

### Doing My Part

I enjoy attending social events with a healthy mix of front and back-end students.  
I'm not too proud to help Blake Street students house clean on Friday or go out for dinner afterwards.  
My goal is to get more involvement with education now that I've completed module one.
