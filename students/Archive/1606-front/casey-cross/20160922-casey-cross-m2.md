3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts.

### Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser in React

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/kccrs/number-guesser-react
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html

I redid a Module One project but implemented it using React.

Evaluation comments: Brittany told me that my JavaScript is clean and understandable.  I can work on understanding component life cycles.

Evaluation scores: N/A


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had four major group projects this module.

#### A Very Lonely Chat Room

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/chat-room
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/chatroom.html

A chat app using local storage and sadly only one user can chat with themselves.  So, a chat app for introverts.

This project was a struggle.  We did not complete all the required components and the UI was sad and needed a lot of help.

## Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

## User Interface

2.5 - interface shows effort, comps had an effective layout that wasn't completed in execution. Good starting point, needs fine tuning.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing  

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow  

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation  

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## Design

2.5 - needs polish, didn't get through implementation of comps.

##### Feedback to Me from Paul Nguyen

Casey and I worked on our Tier 1 project, Chatroom App. This was our second project together. It always amazing working with her because she super accommodating and helpful when I’m banging my head against a wall. I appreciate her meticulous attention to detail and admire her willingness to take the lead when she has an idea. I feel like our brains are in sync now and I can’t wait for our third project together.

#### Tier One Pomodoro App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/tier-one-pomodoro)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

We chose to make a Pomodoro app and I feel this was one of my most successful projects at Turing to date.  I stretched myself and finally started to become comfortable with JavaScript.

Evaluation Comments: Design was great, could use more contrast, less opacity in the header.  Our CSS could be organized better.

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## User Interface  

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Feedback to Me from Madison Kerndt

Casey and I worked together on our Tier One Pomodoro app. Casey has mad debugging skills! Whenever there is a tiny error or merge conflict Casey is your girl. We had a lot of fun working on this project and putting together the user interface of our application. I really appreciated Casey's willingness to look into a framework she had not previously used like SCSS.

#### Tier Two Networking App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kccrs/networking)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

In this project we chose to develop a networking app called GetWorking using Firebase and React. It was challenging to use two new technologies simultaneously in one project and also to work in a group of 3 for the first time, but overall this project was a success and I learned a lot.

Evaluation comments:

Had blueberries, wanted to share. (- Louisa)
Try to combine some of the logged in functionality.  Change toggleEditable to setState.

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## HTML Style

2.5: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

Soft 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### Feedback to Me from David Kerr

Your SASS skills are on point.  This will be the project I continue to go back and reference for requiring, organizing, and importing SASS files, so thank you for that.  You were incredibly flexible and a great communicator, making working with you easy.  As far as areas for improvement, I think we were all trying to figure out what was going on with react… so I would only say that we could have made our lives easier with a group of 3 with a group list of remaining tasks.  I enjoyed the project and think it went well!

##### Feedback to Me from MaryJane Valade

Project 3: Networking App
Casey C.
I really enjoyed teaming up with you on this project. You were always willing to try out any idea - even if we thought it wouldn’t work it was still helpful to rule it out and see what happened. Thank you for cleaning up all the styles and helping me understand sass better. You were great at helping to keep us on track, even when one of our group members was a little out of it.

#### Shoot the Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

This project is a fully functional chat app.  I am very proud of this project and I think it is my best project at Turing so far.  We used React and Firebase to implement this app.

Evaluation comments: Louisa said this was the best Sass she'd seen all day, recommends to study the independent study lesson to take CSS naming to the next level. We had a solid testing suite and our React was broken out into useful components. Our UI doesn't completely follow the spec and could use some adjustments.

Rubric:
Specification Adherence

    4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

    4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

User Interface

    3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

CSS/Sass Style

    4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

JavaScript Style

### Giving Feedback

#### Lonely Chat Room - partner Paul Nguyen

I worked with Paul on our lonely chatroom app.  Paul and i worked together on back to back projects, which I didn’t mind because he is easy to work with.  He has a great sense of humor and makes even stressful projects feel more manageable.  Paul and I often joke that we should be hired as a duo because we’ve learned to work together so well and our skills are evenly matched.

#### Tier One Pomodoro App - partner Madison Kerndt

I worked with Madison on our Pomodoro app.  Madison has an excellent work ethic and will not stop until a feature is complete.  She is very focused and driven.  Madison also has some solid design chops and pushes herself to learn new tools and technologies such as P5JS.  She designed the UI for our project which was very clean, polished, and beautiful. My only constructive criticism is that occasionally she gets focused on one way of doing a thing, but even then she will adapt to other ideas when challenged.  I would work with Madison again.

#### Tier Two Networking App - partner David Kerr

I worked with David on a group project creating a networking app.  David is very sharp and a quick learner.  His brain works very rapidly and thus his coding is also very quick, but he is always willing to stop and explain his thinking, even several times if need be.  My constructive criticism is that because David conceptually gets some concepts quickly, he sometimes will shut down other partners ideas because he understands they will not work.  In my particular learning style, I need to try things and see them break before I understand how they work correctly, and it was hard to do that sometimes on this project.  But overall David is a great partner.

#### Tier Two Networking App - partner MaryJane Valade

 I worked with MaryJane on a group project developing a networking app.  MaryJane is fantastic.  She is a hard worker and is great at seeking out help and advice whenever she feels she needs it.  She does not waste time and is very collaborative and resourceful.  MaryJane’s work ethic is inspiring, not only is she killing it on projects, she is also raising four year old twins. She has even resorted to going to Starbucks at night when her home internet when out and then sitting in her car outside after Starbucks closed working on a project so she could maintain internet connection. That is dedication.

#### Shoot the Breeze - partner Jeff Duke

Casey Cross [11:14 AM]  
I worked with Jeff on our Firebase and React based chat app.  From the start, we were organized and on the same page.  We both wanted to learn more about compartmentalizing React components and how to test them.  We made a solid plan to divide and conquer and were both very efficient.  Our communication styles worked well together.  Jeff is very sharp and eager to help the whole cohort with testing using mocks and stubs.  Jeff is a great teammate.

### Being a Community Member

Casey paired with me and helped me to refactor during a project.  She showed me some very useful tools and techniques to use with my CSS.  I appreciated her encouraging me to explore and play around with certain elements of my styling, as I'm often reluctant to do so. Thanks for your help and encouragement, Casey!
