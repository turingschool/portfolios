# Casey Cross -  M3 Portfolio

### Module 3 (Front-end)

## Areas of Emphasis

In module three, I wanted to expand my knowledge of JavaScript frameworks as well as extend my design and web styling skills.  I also wanted to practice the types of exercises that will show up in technical interviews.

# Portfolio Rubric

## Rubric

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.   They build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond supports of the community.
-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application includes all of the major functionality. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Determining the right tools for the job
- 4 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them

### Following Documentation
- 3 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Needed some instructor guidance to implement them correctly.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Remember

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/kccrs/1606-remember-8
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/quizzer.html

I implemented this project in Ember.  It was an exercise in real world Git workflow where I implement one feature at a time and respond to evaluator input to make changes.

Evaluation comments: N/A
Evaluation scores: N/A

#### Personal Project - GloBot

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/kccrs/globot
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html

I created a create-your-own-adventure story in React using a text-to-speech API.  I also implemented CSS animations of SVGs and used the Susy library along with Sass to make my site responsive.

Evaluation comments: Comments from Brenna - You did a great job, you'll have to teach me about SVGs.  You may want to consider other font choices.
Evaluation scores: Pass

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I had one major group projects this module.

#### Weather Forecast

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/kylem038/weather-forecast
* [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html

We built a weather app that allows the user to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.  We used React, Redux, Geolocation API, and the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

- 3:  Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

##### Feedback to Me from Brett Hevia

  I worked with Casey on the first project of the module, Weatherly. It was our first time working in groups of four and really dividing and conquering, and Casey took the initiative and spearheaded the testing and SASS architecture portions of our project. I think one of the biggest things our team struggled with was maintaining communication and explaining thought processes when it came time to bring a lot of our divided and conquered parts of the project together.

##### Feedback to Me from Mike Sausa

  Casey was a delight to work with! Her superb testing skills allowed us to produce efficient code and were a very welcome addition to our group. Her attitude was great throughout despite us having some difficulty learning the necessary material to produce our app. Casey (and everybody else - myself included) seemed to struggle a little bit with Redux, but Iâ€™m sure she will be more comfortable with it upon revisiting it. All in all, Casey was so fun to work with and the thought of potentially not working with her again makes me want to exercise my newly implemented right to legally euthanize myself. Thanks Case!

##### Feedback to Me from Kyle Misencik

  Enjoyed working with you again! You're ability to test react / redux is still something I'm trying to mimic in other projects. I've also seen a big improvement in your coding abilities across the board. We're starting to tackle some very complex problems, & I think we all need to get better at admitting we don't understand something & ask for more explanation. Otherwise keep doing what you're doing & keep working hard. Hope to work with you again!

### Giving Feedback

#### Weather Forecast - Brett Hevia

This was the second time I got to work with you and I think your overall technical skills have skyrocketed over the course of this program.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job of trying to isolate functionality and focus on one piece at a time but still maintaining a cohesive project.  You stayed calm and steady even when stuck and frustrated. My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

#### Weather Forecast - Kyle Misencik

This was the second time I got to work with you.  Your ability to seek guidance from your mentor and other people when you need to is something I need to emulate.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job of trying to separate out functionality but still maintaining a cohesive project as well as maintaining a good attitude even when things were really tough.  You have definitely improved on handling frustration since the first time I worked with you.  My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

#### Weather Forecast - Mike Sausa

This was the first time I got to work with you and I found you very easy to work with.  This was a very challenging project and I think you did a good job at keeping a positive attitude as we encountered obstacles.  You made me feel comfortable asking questions and commiserating on our frustrations.  You stayed calm and steady even when stuck and frustrated while still trying to stretch your knowlege and skills.  My feedback for all of us on this team is the same - we can all improve on communicating with each other throughout the project, such as having more check-ins with the group as a whole.

### Playing a Part

I contributed to open source by correcting spelling and grammar issues in one of our lesson markdowns and submitting a pull request. I also helped organize and set up our new class space, making sure we have sufficient supplies to enhance our education.

  * Pitch for personal project/Documentation showing your thought process

  I want to make a create-your-own-adventure story in React using a text-to-speech API and practice using animations and explore designing with SVGs. I wanted to use text to speech to make the site more accessible to kids who haven't yet learned to read, English language learners, and kids with disabilities.
