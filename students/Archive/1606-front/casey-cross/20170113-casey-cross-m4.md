# Casey Cross -  M4 Front End Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 4 were to increase my confidence as a developer and become very comfortable with at least one JavaScript framework (in my case, React).  I also set out to complete one CodeWars challenge per day.  I did not maintain that pace, but I have completed a good number of then, enhancing my vanilla JS skills, specifically in array, string, and object methods.

## Self-Evaluation

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 3: ~~Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment~~ || **excused from assessment**

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

### D: Professional Development

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
They build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I had enough points from the rest of my coursework that I did not need to complete the final assessment.

This was a workshop we completed using WebSockets with an Express server.

Evaluation comments: N/A

Evaluation scores: N/A

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During module 4 we completed four projects: Jet Fuel, Imposter Syndrome, Curiously Native, and our final Capstone Project.

#### Jet Fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

In this project we built a URL shortener service
that allows users to submit long URLs and creates shortened URLs and auto redirects short URLs to their original address. The app also tracks URL usage and provides popularity statistics.

## Evaluation

### Specification Adherence

* **35 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* **10 points** - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Total Score: 88/100

#### Feedback from Jeff Duke

Casey it was great working with you on the capstone project and Jet Fuel.  As we've worked on several projects together there isn't much constructive feedback I can give.  It was great working with you on both projects, we work well together and our git workflow is on point!  It was great working with you throughout the program!

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [First Attempt (abandoned) - GitHub URL](https://github.com/kccrs/recipes)
* [Second Attempt - GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/electron-recipes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

This was an exploration in building a desktop application using Electron. We were free to structure and use any JavaScript framework or library of our choosing.  We chose to use Ember and intended to pull in data from the Spoonacular API.  Due to extensive complications we ended up scrapping the entire project and rebuilding it in two days using jQuery.

## Rubric

### Blog Post
* 45 Points

### JavaScript Style
(received 30 points)

* 35: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### User Interface
(received 5 points)

* 7: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Risk Taking and Creativity
(received 40 points)

- 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 30: Developers attempted to implement feature using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.

### Workflow
(received 18 Points)

* 20: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches.
* 15: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. There is little evidence of code review.

### Extensions
(received 20 points)

- Developer packaged their application for distribution.

### Total Score: 158/175

#### Feedback from MaryJane Valade

If ever there was someone to burn down a project with I'm glad it was with you! I think we gave our Ember/Knex/SQLite/Electron app a valiant try and we would have succeeded if not for the database hangup. I'm glad we put in the effort to relearn Ember again but it was unfortunate we couldn't put more time into the fun Electron things. I really enjoyed working with you and you were always able to keep me from getting ahead of myself. Making the decision to start over two days before the project was due took courage but was the right thing to do and at least we produced a workable app. I don't think we could have succeeded in such a short time without a good workflow and partnership.

#### Curiously Native

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kccrs/React-Native)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/curiously-native.html)

This is an alternative fuel locator app built with React Native and Redux.  It retrieves data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and enables the user to map nearby locations to access energy sources such as biodiesel or electricity.  It also incorporates several data visualizations using Victory Native.

## Rubric

### Authentication

* 10: A user can successfully login and logout using  Auth0 and can update user information in the app.

### Immutable Redux

* 5: Attempt at using ImmutableJS but really it's a dumpster fire of data.

### Visualizations

* 15: There are two unique data visualization with basic animations.

### Blog Post
* 45 Points

### JavaScript Style

* 25: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### User Interface

* 7: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. Some attempt to create a unique client interface and experience.

### Risk Taking and Creativity

- 25: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

### Workflow

* 8: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. There is little evidence of code review.

### Total Score: 147/175

#### Feedback from Casey Metz

I was happy to get the opportunity to work with my friend Casey this mod. I was impressed by her excellent instinct for project management and organization, keeping me motivated and accountable. She's willing to take on any task with good humor and energy, and she pushes herself to stick with challenging problems. My suggestion for Casey would be to keep an eye on her 'self-talk'; during our project, she sometimes fell into the trap of defeatism, emphasizing the negatives of the situation. This kind of self-deprecation can threaten to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our project turned out well, and I'd encourage Casey to recognize that she's more capable than she sometimes gives herself credit for. I've appreciated Casey's strength and realness for my entire time here at Turing, and I hope she carries her social awareness, and the power of her voice, with her into the working world. I'm confident she will.

#### Capstone Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/turing-fridays)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

This app provides a much needed service to the Turing staff and community. Each Friday at Turing School of Software and Design students host personal interest and extracurricular learning groups called spikes. This app enables any student with a GitHub account to log in to submit a spike proposal to the staff. Staff can then log in and approve spikes and assign them to classroom locations. All students can then log in to self-select the spike they have chosen to attend.

#### Feedback from Pete Springer

The capstone was the first time Casey and I have worked together. This project incorporated the most divide and conquer I have experienced. One thing I noticed that Casey did very well was encouraging us to stay organized with github
issues and code reviews. I also appreciated Casey's willingness and enthusiasm to forge through testing our app.

#### Feedback from Kirsten Swanson

I’m glad I finally got to work with Casey because otherwise I would have been sad if I hadn’t worked with her during my time at Turing. During our capstone project she kept our group very organized and accountable for Github issues, which made our workflow go smoothly. Her motivation to test is inspiring and will definitely benefit her in the future. We had 65 tests! She’s a master at resolving merge conflicts and not at all afraid to encounter them. Together we worked on styling and put together a really polished app. Casey is up for any challenge and ready to tackle whatever aspect of the project needs to be worked on, whether it’s testing, styling, or functionality. It was a pleasure working with Casey!

#### Feedback from David Kerr

Every team needs a Casey.  She makes light of things which are weighing everyone down, is always willing to ask questions when she is unsure if the team is on the right path, and always looks to add value however she can.  Because Casey is more diligent and paced in her programming, there were many times in this project Casey had to deal with merge conflicts which were just not her fault.  Rather than complaining as most would, she put the team goals first and kept going.  I look forward to remaining frenemies with Casey moving forward.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Job Search Priorities
###### Paragraph description of top three priorities in the job search and why

* My number one priority in my job search is to remain in Denver. I have lived here for 15 years and have no interest in moving.  My second priority is an environment that is supportive, gives the freedom to ask a lot of questions and/or provides mentorship, and enhances my professional growth. My third priority would be a casual and flexible work environment.  I hate having to wear business casual and would like the flexibility to work remote on occasion and not have a rigid 8 to 5 workday.  I am a night person and not at all a morning person so I prefer to start later and work later into the evening.  I would like the option to do that, at least occasionally.

* Takeaways from the session -
It was good to clearly define my priorities so I know what I will and won't accept.  It will help me refine my job search and what to research.  This will also help guide some of the questions I will ask potential employers during the interview process.

#### Perceived Barriers to the Job Search
###### 1-2 paragraph action plan for how to overcome perceived barriers to the job search

* Barrier:  Lack of confidence in coding skills --> action --> emphasize existing completed projects, pretend to be confident (fake it until you make it), emphasize I have no bad coding habits yet, am moldable and adaptable.
* Barrier: Shyness & being uncomfortable reaching out to strangers --> action --> understand that many developers feel this way and that cold outreach is an established norm in the community.  Practice practice practice.

* Takeaways from the session -
It is good to keep reminding myself of these and understanding that I am not alone in feeling this way but I cannot let these things hinder me or my professional future.

#### Cold Outreach Emails

1. Nicole Hall -
Backend developer at Pairin

2. Kim Kutt -
Customer Support Associate at Craftsy

3. Cassidy Smirnow -
Senior VP of Operations at Four Winds Interactive

4. Carrie Marvin -
Tech Recruiter at Trello

5. Tim Cigrand -
Front End Engineer at Apto

6.  Kaitlyn Binversie -
Sr Corporate Recruiter - Four Winds Interactive

7. Kris Foss -
Havenly


* Takeaways from the session -
Cold outreach is hard and uncomfortable but can be successful for both networking and opening doors to job opportunities.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Pete Springer

This was my first opportunity to work with Pete, and I’m glad I got the chance.  Pete has some solid JavaScript chops.  The thing I admire the most about Pete is that he remains cool, calm, and collected even in the face of frustration.  He is always willing to help out another team member.  I would happily work with Pete again in the future.

#### Feedback to MaryJane Valade

I worked with MaryJane for the second time during our Imposter Syndrome project.  We challenged ourselves to implement an Electron app in Ember with SQLite.  MaryJane is always 100% dedicated to the task at hand and does not give up even in the face of seemingly insurmountable struggles.  We had a very difficult issue in our project that caused us to reach out to a number of senior developers including members of Ember’s development team.  MaryJane persevered, even when we decided to burn the whole project down in the 11th hour and rebuild it from scratch using jQuery.  I would work with MaryJane again any day.  She is a kind and hardworking teammate.

#### Feedback to Jeff Duke

I worked with Jeff twice this module, thus I have now partnered with him three times. Jeff makes a fantastic teammate, our strengths complement each other nicely.  On our second project he suggested we take our git workflow to the next level through GitHub issues, and I have found them incredibly useful on all subsequent projects.  I know Jeff is going to be highly successful in his career and I look forward to seeing what kinds of cool robotics he makes!

#### Feedback to Casey Metz

I worked with Casey during our React Native project.  Casey has the best first name out of anyone in our cohort.  We worked very well together.  We both wanted to create a mobile app that was meaningful and had a positive impact on the world, thus we chose to make an app to locate alternative energy sources.  I very much enjoyed working with Casey as we share a goofy, light-hearted sense of humor that helped us get through some of the tougher moments of our project.  Casey is helpful and hard-working and has a good understanding of Redux, which is no small feat.  He is going to excel in his career and would be an asset to any team.

#### Feedback to David Kerr

This was my second opportunity to work with David.  David has incredibly strong JavaScript skills and picks up concepts very quickly.  I really appreciate that David is always willing to stop what he’s doing to help another teammate out when they are struggling.  David has a lot of strong opinions, as do I, so occasionally we butt heads, but we are always able to eventually come to a mutual and amicable agreement.  I look forward to seeing what amazing things David accomplishes in his professional career.

#### Feedback to Kirsten Swanson

I’m glad I finally got to work with Casey because otherwise I would have been sad if I hadn’t worked with her during my time at Turing.

It was a pleasure working with Casey!

### Being a Community Member

See feedback from teammates above.

### Playing a Part

During this module I volunteered to be a TA and a panelist during the one day front end Try Turing event held in January.  I also participated on a panel of female Turing students and alumni that was broadcast live on the internet to promote Turing's message of diversity and inclusivity for under-represented populations in tech.  Additionally I joined dozens of Turing students for Hack the Dot, a 90 minute fun and frenzied hack session.
