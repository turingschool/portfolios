# Adam Bernard - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to push myself in my Javascript learning this mod and make sure that I really started to understand more about how to properly write it.  I really wanted to show my instructors that I could make the most out of the mod and push my learning.  I also didn't want to take the easy route in any project I did and push myself to learn more than what I needed to on all projects.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think I have come a long way since the end of mod-1 and have really pushed myself overall to not just learn more, but taking risks and really learning from reviews.  I also made sure I spent more time understanding everything I was implementing into my code, so that I could utilize it at further dates.  I think I grew a lot over the mod and I am really understanding and remembering what I am learning more effectively.


## B: Individual Assessment

#### Final Assessment

Wrote a simple program in React, that lets a user type in a word to play in Scrabble and is returned its point value as they type. The words are also stored in an array on submit for future reference. There is no database or local storage associated with program so the array of words are only saved until the browser or tab in browser are closed.

I improved a lot over the mod and have improved from barely earning 3's on my assessment to having solid 3's as a coder.  Still some room for improvement, but overall definetly showed a lot of improvement in the past 6 weeks.

All 3's;

#### Chatroom 1.0

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1606/chat_room_1/kirsten_adam.md)

Worked on a Chatroom application that a user could enter a message that was displayed on the screen.  There was no database connected in the application so a friend message was hardcoded into the application that would return a prewritten message after each entry.  All user specific messages were also given a delete and edit option that could only use on there sent messages.

Overall we had a good project that needed some changes.  We had a few design critiques about the colors we chose and making sure that we made a bigger change between a user message and a friend message.  We also could have done a little better at our testing as this was our greatest area for improvement.

From Kirsten: This was our second project working together, so going into this project I knew we had good workflow. You have strong testing knowledge and skills. You’re very resourceful when we were struggling and you would reach out for help whether it was asking others or researching something online. Sometimes I felt discouraged when you would say things were “easy” and I didn’t necessarily feel the same. I think here it would be good for you to explain your thinking or have you drive, so that you can logically step through your thought processes. Also during our evaluations I noticed how you kept on using “I” and I feel like I had a large contribution to the project and worked long hours, so I felt like I wasn’t getting the credit I deserved. When talking about the project it would have been better to use “we.” Thanks for holding your composure together when our gh-pages branch wasn’t working. I was definitely panicking, but your calm demeanor helped me to overcome this panic attack. Also your drive to complete phase three motivated me to complete it and push through to make it happen. Overall, I think our finished application turned out really well and was aesthetically pleasing. You definitely have an eye for design.

#### Tier-one

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/pomodoro)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-one.html)

Made a Pomodoro application that would keep track of work time and break times.  On each fourth break in a cycle through the break time would double to take a longer break.  There was also an input on the home screen that let the user put in there own work and break times.  

The application needed little to no explanation on its use and was easy to navigate.  We could have done better at breaking out our functions to smaller functions and we could have factored our HTML better as well.  Overall though it was a good app and the really appreciated its design.

From Mike: Adam was awesome throughout our Pomodoro app and was extremely flexible in a situation where I was unable to be present for a weekend. His design and styling skills are awesome and I really appreciated him taking the reigns there. It was also really helpful to pair with him and walk through the logic for our app as we complemented each other’s knowledge quite well. Adam was really fun to work with and always brought good cheer and vibes to the table. I really enjoyed working with him and hope we get to do it again in the near future!

#### Tier-two

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/tier-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/tier-two.html)

We designed an application that allowed users to create Professional contacts and keep them in one place.  It was our first project in React and we took risks on self teaching ourselves React-Router and using it in the project as well.  We utilized firebase as well to store all our data and let each user be able to retrieve their own contacts.  In the application the user was able to add a contact with their basic contact information and had an area to take notes on their encounter.  

All our teachers were very proud that as a group we decided to learn React-Router on our own and utilize it in the project.  One of our color choses was a little aggresive, but otherwise design was good.  We had trouble hosting our application in firebase and this caused some of our scores overall to drop, but otherwise they seemed very pleased with our overall project.

From Paul: Adam and I worked on our Networking App in module 2. This was the first time I was paired up with Adam and it was our first project with a group of 3. He was extremely accommodating when I didn’t understand a the logic behind something. Adam also set aside time to help me understand flexbox a little better. I learned a lot from this group and I especially appreciate Adam’s help. He also encouraged our group to step outside of our comfort zone and experiment with react routers and in the end it turned out great.

From Ben: I really enjoyed working with Adam for the second time. Again, he had a great vision of where we needed to go with the project. He made some insanely detailed wireframes that really helped us lay the framework for not only our design, but also the overall functionality of our app. He also spearheaded the way for us to work with React Router, which I think will definitely pay dividends as we enter Mod 3. He crushed the CSS and had a profound understanding of the concepts we were working with, and did his best to help me understand them as we chugged along, so thank you for that!
If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to focus on crushing the code. You have some of the best understanding of all of the things we’ve worked with so far this Mod, but it seemed like sometimes you were timid when it came to starting to write the solutions to the problems. Once we started coding, you could certainly hop in and grind things out, but I think you could really take your developer prowess to the next level once you can get over the initial hesitation to start writing things out.

#### Shoot the Breeze

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

We made another chatroom application, but this time we did the entire application in React and used Firebase, so that users could chat with their friends.  Users are able to see messages from other users without signing in and once they signed in with google they were also able to add messages up to 140 characters.  They were able to search through the messages by the content of each message.  Users are also about to sort the messages in reverse order as well as select someone who has contributed to the app and only see there messages.

We did really well at making sure we had all functionality and that the site was responsive. They also really liked that we took risks on completing an extension as well as breaking out our button component for reuse.  We could have used less states on our overall application, which also would have help get rid of if statements.  Overall though we did a great job on the project and should refactor a lot.

From Madison: Adam's understanding of the React framework is impressive and helped our creation process go extremely smoothly. He always refers to the docs and is willing to take on challenges head on. He also takes the time to figure out the most efficient way to implement said changes with new approaches. My only feedback is I would have liked to have had more conversation around various approaches to decide which is the best option for this use case.  Our project went extremely smoothly overall and Adam went above and beyond by dedicating extra time to implement an extension — totally awesome!


## D: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Kirsten: The project went well except for github pages for some reason we still don’t know.  It was great that you took over and got the base of the project completed that we could expand on.  After talking after the project I would say an are of opportunity was letting me know more when you were confused compared to panicing. I would also say to relax more on projects and not worry about the end project having everything, but making sure what is coded is the best you can do.  Otherwise it was a great project and you killed it when it came to the css and making the project look like the wireframes we had built.  

To Mike: I worked with Mike on our Pomodoro application.  It was pleasant to work with him and he did a lot of work on the Javascript on the application which gave me time to focus on the design and css for the project.  He really focused on understanding the functionality behind the application which helped us finish the project on time.  He was gone over the weekend of the project and his only opportunity was reaching out more while he was gone, so that I understood where he was at during the weekend.  Otherwise he did a lot even though he was attending a wedding and put us in a good spot when he returned.

To Ben: This is the second time I was able to work with Ben and I think it went just as well as the first time.  He was a huge help on rendering items to the page and helping with the functionality of React.  He also had a huge impact on our overall design on the application and gave really great ideas on how the app would function.  His only opportunity was that  he could easily be distracted by his phone and would we would need to grab his attention again after.  Otherwise he was a huge help and it was great that he took time on the first Friday to sit down and learn React so he could explain things to Paul and I.

To Paul: This was the first time I was able to work with Paul on a project.  It went really well and Paul was a great help on throwing out ideas and helping us think outside the box.  I know he had some trouble figuring out React at first but made sure that he was vocal about it, so that it gave us an opportunity to explain things.  His opportunity on the project was most likely talking through more of what he didn’t understand by telling us what he thought was going on and we could explain it easier to him if he was lost.  Paul also was a huge help on our css and design and really wanted to spend time on making sure he got better at css while doing the project, which I think he did a great job.

To Madison:  It was a pleasure to work with Madison on our final project and I believe we worked really well together.  She absolutely killed it on the SASS of the application as well as really understanding the testing and working hard to make sure to test our entire application.  Her only opportunity would be to make sure she took more time navigating and not always driving.  Otherwise again she absolutely killed it and was a huge help all around when it came down to it.  She really is passionate about learning more everyday and pushing herself to make everything perfect.

### Playing a Part

This mod I started working more at the Blake Street campus and talking more to back-end students.  It was nice getting to talk about current projects and what was actually happening on campus.  I also was able to help a little with one of the sessions that Mike lead on CSS.  I also gave time slots, so that if mod-1 front-end students wanted to pair with me they could, even though I only had one session.
