# Adam Bernard - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Push myself to reference docs and research problems online, so that I could get better at reading and understanding them, so I could fix my own problems.  I also really wanted to do my self-directed project in react native.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I really do think I learned a lot this module and was happy to take on the challenge of learning something new every project we did this module.  I also feel a lot better at reading docs and trying to figure out how to get things up and running without just finding someone else's solution first. I do think I am getting better at trying things even though they might not work although I still think I have room to improve in this area as well.  I can also find myself getting caught up on one solution and need to make sure I step back and try to find another solution if something is not working.  Overall though I feel a lot better at where I am as a programmer.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The only Individual Project we had was out self-directed project.

#### HomebrewJournal

* [DTR](https://github.com/ab255/homebrewJournal)

I decided that I was going to make a Home brew Journal application in react-native that kept track of notes that are taken throughout the home brew process.  I used the react native library to create the app and utilized the docs to make components that worked on the IOS platform. I wanted t make sure that I was able to save, edit, and delete all entries and I was also able to get the app uploaded and working on my phone.

Need to look into refactoring code and working on some of the UI was the biggest feedback I received.  At the end of the project I was more worried about learning how to use the native components that react native offered as well as learning how to utilize Jest for test, but could have focused on refactoring as well.  There is also UI components that need improvement as once the app was on my phone it did not perform as well as I thought it did on the computer.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group projects over the course of the module.

####  Weather App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/07nguyenpaul/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

Create a react Weather Application that utilized React-Router and Redux.  Also utilized geolocation services and made calls to a weather API to receive current conditions.  I would automatically find your current location's weather and you were also able to pin cities based on their Zip Code and also display there weather.  You could also see an extended forecast for your current location.

liked our handleSubmit function and how the functionality and state were kept in the component, good prioritizing with having things work with components first before breaking out into containers, have containers only return the component or actionCreator that is needed and not the whole state, start testing with reducers and actions rather than components first, start with one reducer file and then break out into separate files, make more use of Github tools

Spec Adherence: 4
Redux: 4
Routing: 3
JS: 4
Testing: 2
Workflow: 3

From Kirsten: This was our third project together and I feel like we have an understanding of each other’s workflow. This time around however it seemed like we were applying frameworks that we weren’t so familiar with, but you did a good job with reading the documents and then explaining concepts to us. At times it seemed like you were explaining your ideas to approach solving our problems more than actually driving. Don’t be afraid to take control and just start typing even if you’re not sure if it’s going to break. Due to the group being four people our team dynamics changed for this project, but you did a nice job facilitating how people should split work up. This helped in making sure that we covered all aspects of our project in an organized way. However, at times it seemed like the group had a clash with ideas about how to approach Redux and better communication about your progress would have been more productive. Lastly, it seemed like you implemented my feedback from the last project when explaining the work done on the project, so good work with applying that. Nice job again!

From Casey M.: I enjoyed working with Adam on our weather app. He is a quick learner and helped to push the group forward with his enthusiasm. I appreciated his initiative towards splitting the group up into pairs and organizing our tasks. My suggestions for Adam are: 1) to "drive" more during group/pairing sessions, and 2) to practice using more "we"-based language when giving advice, e.g. "I think we should try...." instead of "you should do..." This goes a long way towards others feeling receptive and collaborative. Overall Adam is really good at figuring out new technologies, and he's good at using his excitement to drive  projects forward.

From Paul: It was great working with Adam again just because I feel like I know what he’s thinking when we’re bouncing ideas off to each other. Since we had a bigger group for this project he took the initiative to do research on the next part. Adam was our mister docs when it came to react-redux. He understood the global sense of it and my only critique for you is to just try implementing the docs even if the syntax may mess you up occasionally. Adam came through towards the end of the project and helped us render the 5 day 3 hours forecast.

####  Remember Ember App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-6)

Learned how to create an Ember application that you could create, edit and delete notes.  Utilized the Ember docs to try and figure out how to create all features without trying to have to utilize other sites or people.  Started to understand the MVC structure of Ember throughout the process.

No evaluation was given after the completion of the project, but throughout the pr's I felt like we usually only had small fixes and were able to fix them immediately.

We were able to complete through the issue that let us delete a user which was issue number for our group.

From Kyle: Enjoyed working with you on our first Ember app! More so than other teammates I found that we quickly realized when we didn't know something & leveraged docs, Brandon, etc. to knock out issues quickly. Keep up the hard-working attitude & you'll do great coming out of Turing. Hope to work with you again!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I really only felt like I learned two things in this session.  Surprisingly most of my group also felt that the media controls politics and our votes don't really matter except at a local scale.  I also learned that political beliefs are not always the best to talk about especially with people you don't know.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I actually felt like I learned a lot from this gear up.  I think the biggest take away is that you should be more aware of the people you are interacting with and try to make sure that you are giving them an environment that they can succeed in. Some people work great at pairing while others work better by themselves in their own world.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

So this was kind of a weird gear up as I got caught up on what I read and felt like the reading did not define the idea of the gear up that well.  I think we talked more about how you needed to also have an understanding of when you need to also be aware that something is going wrong enough that you need to not act like it doesn't bother you,  but also the little things that get you down shouldn't effect you.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Creativity & Real-World Problem-Solving for the Self-Directed Project

* Link to Completed Deliverables:
  Generating New Ideas

  ASK

  electronic home-brew journal as most journals are paper or different pieces are thrown into different apps, so it would be making something where all there resources can be placed in one location.  
  to many resources in one location
  putting all steps of the brew process in the application so they are all stored in one spot
  Any home brewer.

  a national park application that works off line and gives you trails and can track your location based on starting point? Also has all facts based on points.

  PREPARE

  my create space has no media distractions and preferably walking around and being able to take in the environment while I think about things.

  Deliverables

  Have an application on my phone that allows user to add a beer entry as well as edit the entries and sort them.  I want to make the app in react native so that users are able to use it offline and on their mobile device while they brew.

* Takeaways from session :  I think that the session was great, but I also think it would have been better if the sessions were split into two so that the first was about being creative with the ideas and starting to come up with ideas.  The part were we practice pitching our ideas, I think would be better once we had some time to really think about what the ideas would be.  I felt like I knew my idea already and the second part seemed better although if I didn't have an idea yet it would have been better to have the first part.  Overall I liked that it promoted the idea of pitching ideas off of others no matter if you thought it was a good idea or not.  I also liked the idea of making sure you had a thought out idea when pitching and not to be nervous when pitching it in front of others.

#### Flower Exercise

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6ECxMYCaYfddWFZa2x4eVY0LWs)

* Takeaways from session :  It was great to be able to sit down and really think about what I am looking for in a company that I want to work for.  It will be great to reference when I am looking for companies to apply for or reach out to.  It will also be great to use to come up with questions in interviews or talking to connections about there or other companies.  

#### Job Search Strategy

Strategy:

* Daily: I plan on checking job posting websites to see about positions opening up and what languages they are looking for as well as researching the companies to see what they are about and if I am interested in working for them.  Also recording these companies and seeing if anyone from Turing works for them.

* Weekly: Try to find at least one company that I find interested in and send an email to send a request to sit down with someone and talk to them about there hiring process.  If I have made connections I should at least keep some sort of communication with them by reaching out at least once per week or to sit down and continue communication for when I graduate.

* Monthly:  Try to find a few code challenges to work through in my free time.  I want to send applications to companies to get as many interviews, to get the practice.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Kirsten: It was a pleasure to work on another project with Kirsten and it was awesome that she decided she wanted to take on the task of setting up react router, even though Paul and I had already used it.  I think it is great that she always pushes herself to learn new things and really want to understand them as well.  If she had an opportunity from this project it would be making sure she gets more comfortable splitting the project into smaller sections and not worrying about  being a part of all the project.  Also she did an amazing job at making sure our css and layout was in order at the end of the project to make sure we had a great user experience as well.

To Casey M.: It was great to finally be able to work with Casey on a project.  He did great at making sure that we weren’t rushing anything and that we were understanding what was going on in the app before we just starting writing in code.  This made it easier to make sure we weren't getting stuck in parts. This could also be seen as an opportunity as he could get stuck taking a lot of time figuring out things.  Otherwise it was amazing that he took on the API calls and making sure that we hooked them up correctly and utilize the data.  It was also amazing that he took the time at the end of the project to help us get redux working.

To Paul: It was great working with Paul again on this project and he did great at making sure we were splitting up the project to get things completed.  He was also great at making sure he was helping out everyone in the group complete there parts.  If he had an opportunity it would be to take on parts himself and work through problems on his own as well as helping everyone else out.  In the end it was great that he helped out by learning redux and helping instigate it and putting in the large amount of time needed on the last day to get redux working.

To Kyle: It was very pleasant working with Kyle on the Remember Ember App.  I think it was great that when we started the project that he wanted to TDD the app instead of creating the app and testing after we finished an issue.  If Kyle had an opportunity it would be to sticking to the idea of TDD as we both got caught up fixing the issue before we made a test, so just making sure that he was talking up about sticking to the game plan throughout the entire project.  Otherwise he was a great partner and helped a lot when we were reading the docs and helping talk through the process of figuring out how to successfully apply the docs.

### Playing a Part

This mod I found myself helping out backend students with CSS and ideas on javascript a lot more than I ever had.  I also got to know mod-4 backend students and talk to them more frequently and also help them with situations they were coming across.
