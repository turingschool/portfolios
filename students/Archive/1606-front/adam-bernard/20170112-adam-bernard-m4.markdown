# Adam Bernard - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to learn more about progressive web applications and exploring the database side of programming.  I know in the real world being able to make calls to a database is going to be really important and I want to make sure I understood how to actually make these calls.  I also wanted to push myself to make sure that applications I could push to production, made it to production.  Lastly I just wanted to make sure that I was pushing myself to learn more about where web development and working on my fundamentals, so that I would be able to use them in technical interviews.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Teacher Feedback: Good job on making sure that I had my site deployed and persisting data.  Also a good job at keeping my code to a minimum and breaking out functionality, so that I didn't have to many files and none of the files had to much code in them.  One area to improve on was learning how to manipulate data in Ember.  Otherwise overall the application was easy to use and overall good.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had four projects this module that ranged from learning databases to off line application as well as creating mobile and computer native applications.

####  Jet Fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/jet-pack)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

Create a URL shortener application that would take a long URL and create a shortened version that would redirect to the original URL.  The application used Node.JS to create a server and MongoDB to create a database to persist data.  It also used embedded Javascript and HTML to render everything to the page.

Overall it was great that we were able to persist the data as well as being able to deploy our application to Heroku.  One thing we could have done is instead of using embedded Javascript and HTML, we could have created a front end that was not embedded.  Although this was impressive that we were able to use embedded Javascript and HTML in the project.

Feedback From Madison:

####  Imposter Syndrome

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sikemausa/electron-vue-reminders-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

Created an application that users were able to save reminders that consisted of a title and two dates and times that would set off native notifications. The application lived in the menu bar so that it was always running and the notifications would always trigger. We used Electron so that is was native to computer operating systems as well as Vue as a front end library for the rendering and functionality.

We did well at making sure that the application let users set dates that would set off notifications as well as creating a menu bar application.  One thing we could have improved on was contributing to a NPM module, so that we would be able to make sure the application was unable to be resized.  

Javascript Style: 40 points
User Interface: 7 points
Risk Taking and Creativity: 60 points

Blog Posts: 22 points
Overall: 149 points

Feedback From Mike: Adam was really fun to work with! He really pushed me to try new things that I was hesitant to try at first, such as Vue.js - and I’m really glad we went that route. As always he’s a champ at design and css. He could have maybe gotten his hands on the Vue more, but this was probably more my fault for not explaining things very well than his - sorry about that, Adam! Ultimately, I was really happy that he pushed me on this one, and very happy with how it turned out.

####  Curiously Native

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Peter-Springer/nativeData)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/curiously-native.html)

Create an application that hits an API that gave us back JSON of arrest records of NFL teams and players.  The application lets users see players and their crimes from specific teams.  There is also graphs that show arrests by team, arrests by crime and arrests by position.  The application was created in React Native and used Redux and Immutable.JS to handle the data coming in as well as the profile information of the user.  The app also included Auth0 to let the user sign into the application.

Overall the application met as aspects that were required of the application.  We could have improved on making the graphs interactive as well as using the data to make relationships between the data we were getting back from the api.

Authentication: 10 points
Immutable Redux: 15 points
Visualizations:  points
Blog Posts: 45 points
Javascript Style: 20 points
User Interface: 7 points
Risk Taking and Creativity: 0 points
Workflow: 8 points
Overall: 140 points

Feedback From Pete: This was the third time Adam and I have worked together. Adam had prior experience with react native which helped to speed up my learning on this project. I appreciated his willingness to help bring me up to speed and his flexibility when I had schedule conflicts. Overall working on this project with Adam was "super easy".

####  Capstone Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/madison-kerndt/wellness-challenge)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Created an application that let Turing students sign in to the application and track there wellness as well as be able to see how they are currently doing.  It also allows an admin see a different page on log in that shows the rank of the students.  The application was not able to be fully completed, so some of the data in the app is hardcoded in.  It was created in Ember that used Auth0 for authentication as well as PouchDB and CouchDB to persist data.  The app was also deployed to Heroku.

Although the application was not where it was intended to be at the time of review, we took a lot risks by using Ember, which we only had one week of experience with, as well as taking on learning PouchDB.  Overall the astetic of the app was also very nice and looked like a real production app.  With all the risks we took it also was understandable why it was not fully complete, but we should take in the feedback and look into completing things we ended getting stuck on.

Production: 75 points
Javascript Style: 40 points
User Interface: 30 points
Risk Taking and Creativity: 60 points
Testing: 35 points
Workflow: 50 points
Overall: 290 points

Feedback From Madison:

Feedback From MaryJane: It was fun working with you for the first time. I'm glad you pushed to tackle a legit database rather than roll with firebase again because I think it made for a better application. You made great strides for the project by hooking up the DB and figuring out the deployment issues. Your encouragement and good-heartedness added to the team and helped during the difficult times.ch

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

####MicroAggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

My takeaway from this is that no matter who you are you just can't assume something about them. Also all the readings made micro aggressions seem like racism which is a bigger problem.  Otherwise think before you speak and remember that you never know who is listening.

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

It made me think more about how even though things can seem difficult that you should remember that everyone has a journey that they have to plan out for.  It also was nice to be able to interview others about a Journey they took as it gave me more experience with interviewing.  It made it easier to realize that being prepared for an interview makes it a lot easier.

#### Grit Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

The biggest take away I got from this gear up is that even though things might get tough that you should always make sure that you keep at it.  I also thought about how that you need to have a mind set that things will be hard and that you can't let that get you down and that you need to keep moving forward.  This can really help going into my job search and making sure that no matter how many interviews I go to that I don't let rejection get to me and keep persisting.

### Professional Development

#### Top Three Priorities in Job Search

My first priority is making sure that I spend at least 4 hours a day searching for jobs and applying to them.  Secondly I want to make sure that I don't let job description get to me and apply to anything that looks like it might interest me.  Thirdly I need to make sure that I continue researching companies wether they are hiring or not and send out cold reach emails to employees to try and make connections within these companies.

#### Plan to Overcome Barriers

To overcome barriers in my job search I need to make sure that I stay resilent at searching for jobs every day as well as completing code challenges or working on projects in my free time to keep my skills sharp.  I also need to make sure that even if I go through the interview process and am not offered a job, that I don't let this discourage me.  I also need to make sure to go to as many meet ups and schedule as many informational interviews as I can to make connections in the industry.  Finally I need to keep track of all my connections as well as interview processes so that I don't find myself forgetting to follow up or missing anything.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Madison: It was great getting to work on Jet Fuel with Madison as this was the second project we worked together on.  She was great at letting me scrap our project on the second day and creating it with MongoDB in mind and making this work as an end goal.  Overall she is very persistent which helped a lot and she never got to overwhelmed by the project as a whole.

To Mike: It was great getting to work with Mike again on this project.  I know he sacrificed his idea for the project and we built something different and he was good about making sure this didn't bother him to much.  One area Mike could have improved on was making sure that he was explaining more about his code contributions, as he took on the part of really learning Vue and I felt like I did not fully understand it.  In the end though he helped a lot with the application and it was awesome that he got our native notifications to work as I know this took him some time to figure out.

To Pete: Awesome getting to work with Pete again and he was great at making sure he was contributing through out the project even though he was going through an interview process at the same time.  He really made sure that he understood Redux and set this up to hold our API information as well as taking on the creation of our graphs.

To Madison: It was AWESOME to work with Madison for a third time during the program.  She really pushed our team to make sure that we were taking risks to learn more instead of taking an easy road.  She did great at creating our comps and trying to make the best deliverable app we could.  One thing she could work on is making sure that when she wasn't able to develop of feature of the app that she either takes a step back from it or finds an alternative.  Otherwise she was great to work with and pushed the entire team to do their best on the application.

To MaryJane: Great first experience working on a project with MaryJane.  She made sure that she was always finding ways to contribute to the application even if she didn't understand what Madison and I were working on.  This could as be an opportunity for her to make sure that she speaks up when she feels lost, so that we can slow the process down and bring her up to speed.  Otherwise she took lead on our styling and testing and made sure that not only did the application look great, but we also had some testing to make sure it worked.

### Self-Solicited Feedback

Overall in this module I think the biggest thing I learned is that I need to make sure that I take time to explain things to partners.  I would sometimes will get over zealous about learning and applying new things that I need to make sure that my team also understands what is going on.  Otherwise I think I am really starting to understand databases and how to communicate to them as a front end developer as well as thinking about the structure of my data.  I think this mod, more than others, gave me more self confidence that I know what I am doing and I will be fine in the real world.

### Playing a Part

This module I ran a Friday Spike on giving and receiving feedback and used what I learned as a store manager, to help others think about how they not only provide feedback, but how they use the feedback that was given to them.  Otherwise I also helped back end students with basic javascript problems.
