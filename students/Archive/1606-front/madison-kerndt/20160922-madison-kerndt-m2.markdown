# Madison Kerndt - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

####Summary:
This module I was deliberate in my effort to achieve my goals to improve my academic capacity, community involvement, and personal balance. Starting out as largely external, my motivation for coding was to conquer a challenge. Accomplishing 70% of my goals, deeper than the surface level, the goal I am most proud of: This module my motivation shifted. I could feel myself truly loving the problem solving processes of creating with code. I am no longer driven by the prospect of an unconquerable challenge. I am driven by the distant yet achievable prospect of creating beautiful, logical things with code.

### Areas of Emphasis

#### Goals:
* Open career options that incorporate my background in design and technology startups
* Familiarize myself with the vocabulary, systems, and tools efficient developers rely on
* Cultivate relationships with Denver Development community
* Create portfolio that stands out with all the necessary componentry that communicates who I am in a well rounded, professional manner
* Build virtual presence in the startup, venture capital, and technology communities

#### My Driving Principles:
* Pursue external interest as it relates to coding, development and tech
* Familiarize myself with the community and available opportunities
* Strategically choose beneficial involvement channels
* Continue to push for improvement but accept current ability

##### Feedback to me from Adam Bernard

It was a pleasure to work with Madison on our final project and I believe we worked really well together.  She absolutely killed it on the SASS of the application as well as really understanding the testing and working hard to make sure to test our entire application.  Her only opportunity would be to make sure she took more time navigating and not always driving.  Otherwise again she absolutely killed it and was a huge help all around when it came down to it.  She really is passionate about learning more everyday and pushing herself to make everything perfect.

##### Feedback to me from Blake Worsley

Madison, I am so glad we had the opportunity to work together. You are an absolute riot and an idea machine! You have an in-depth way of looking into the bigger picture and making large scale changes that I find difficult to do myself. I think that is a great skill to have and it paid off in our project. Your SCSS work was awesome and made it easy form me to work with the file you created. Sometimes we got in over our heads with big changes that I had a difficult time helping you with because we were changing so much. I think you are definitely capable of doing that, but it occasionally made it hard for me to help because I didn’t know what was specifically wrong. Thanks for being a great partner and I can’t wait to work more on the app!

##### Feedback to me from Mike Sausa

Madison was an incredible partner to have. It was extremely valuable for me to pair with Madison, and served as an excellent learning experience to truly cement concepts that I had previously found rather difficult. Her exuberant attitude was always a welcome sight that never failed to cement our group together. She was excellent at planning and progressing the development of our app, and her superlative sass skills really allowed me to get a better understanding of styling. I continually find myself coming (perhaps to her dismay) back to Madison for guidance, and am ultimately thrilled to have her around. She’ll do great things!

##### Feedback to me from Casey Cross

I worked with Madison on our Pomodoro app.  Madison has an excellent work ethic and will not stop until a feature is complete.  She is very focused and driven.  Madison also has some solid design chops and pushes herself to learn new tools and technologies such as P5JS.  She designed the UI for our project which was very clean, polished, and beautiful. My only constructive criticism is that occasionally she gets focused on one way of doing a thing, but even then she will adapt to other ideas when challenged.  I would work with Madison again.

A very lonely chatroom is just that. A chatroom with a single contributing user. Written in object oriented JavaScript, this application allows a single user to conduct a fruitful conversation with a 1606 curated chat-bot. Offering, frankly, hilarious responses this 'lonely' chatroom will keep you occupied for hours. Watch out for the design tho - there are user interactions. Particularly that menu button.

##### Evaluation Comments

##### With Jhun:

The testing looks good, they are very verbose and complete. There is an opportunity to refactor the function by using partial functions (when mult. functions point to one thing) and to test for edge cases. The Javascript is clear and well thought out. There is room for some refactoring - but overall - good job!

##### With Louisa:

I like that you guys took and new and different approach to a chat room and I think that that opens up many opportunities to implement new and innovative ideas. There may be some issues with usability mainly in color contrast, and the size/style of the text. The menu is not really necessary and the icons could benefit from adding text to explain their functionality. Lastly, the line length on larger screens may be too long, since this is a mobile first application, it may be best to limit the line length and better differentiate between messages.

##### Feedback to me from Kris Foss

Working with Madison was wonderful.  She is incredibly positive and enthusiastic.  She meets challenges with a sense of curiosity and determination and it’s a pleasure to be part of finding the solution with her.  Her projects are well executed and throughly researched.  She is tenacious and wants to understand the code inside and out.  I’ve been really impressed by the combination of this passion, skill, and creativity she demonstrates.  She shows grace under fire and will make an excellent addition to any development team.  I can’t wait to see what she does with all of her talent.

##### Feedback to me from Brett Hevia

I worked with Madison for the first project of the module (lonely chatroom) and she was a fantastic partner. She’s incredibly meticulous and detail-oriented (which I appreciate because of how not either of those things I am,)  but she’s also able and willing to take a big-picture view and try to learn new things. She was patient with my need to indulge whims (like when I wasted an entire day writing dumb bot responses for everyone in class) and my general stubbornness when it comes to problem-solving. Madison’s infectious energy and enthusiasm for learning kept me out of my habit of getting burnt out/bored with a project with a few days left and sort of crawling to the finish line.

### Giving Feedback

##### Feedback to Adam Bernard (Shoot the Breeze)

Adam's understanding of the React framework is impressive and helped our creation process go extremely smoothly. He always refers to the docs and is willing to take on challenges head on. He also takes the time to figure out the most efficient way to implement said changes with new approaches. My only feedback is I would have liked to have had more conversation around various approaches to decide which is the best option for this use case.  Our project went extremely smoothly overall and Adam went above and beyond by dedicating extra time to implement an extension — totally awesome!

##### Feedback to Blake Worsley (Tier Two Project Partner)

Blake is awesome to work with. His up beat mentality and his 'sky is the limit' mentality made our project super fun! He has a way of keeping his code is extremely functional and I admire his ability to jump in and get things working. He always cautions to take small steps(which is something I always need to work on). Also he is extremely visual which helped keep the group on track though the project and also helped us to flush out concepts we felt uncertain about. Ultimately his upbeat mentality, great sense of humor, and kick ass design skills made him an awesome partner. I look forward to working with Blake again in the future.

##### Feedback to me from Mike Sausa (Tier Two Project Partner)

Be like Mike. I admire Mike's ability to balance health and academics and his dedication to both. His light hearted and upbeat attitude during our project was extremely refreshing. I was impressed by his mental malleability. He was able to adjust his thinking to different problem solving approaches that best fit the particular context at hand. Mike was also vocal about when he didn't understand a concept, which benefitted the whole group, myself in articular, by uncovered incorrect assumptions. Mike was a great partner to work with and I look forward to working with him in the future.

##### Feedback to Casey Cross (Tier One Pomodoro Partner)

Casey and I worked together on our Tier One Pomodoro app. Casey has mad debugging skills! Whenever there is a tiny error or merge conflict Casey is your girl. We had a lot of fun working on this project and putting together the user interface of our application. I really appreciated Casey's willingness to look into a framework she had not previously used like SCSS. Overall I really appreciated Casey's willingness to look into a framework she had not previously used like SCSS.

##### Feedback to Kris Foss (Chatroom 1.0 Partner)

Kris, your calm whole demeanor was extremely refreshing in the high pressure environment of Turing. I felt that we connected on a deeper level around true motivations and future aspirations. It was great to get some perspective on what the job searching process will look like. In working on lonely chatroom I was impressed by your ability to drop into a problem and find the bug. Also your design ability is amazing. Good luck in your job search and I hope to get the chance to work with you again in the future.

##### Feedback to Brett Hevia (Chatroom 1.0 Partner)

Brett, you are awesome! I am so impressed with your humble nature and extreme talent as a coder and teacher. You helped me work though so many issues with knowledge and patience. Thank you for all of your help. Your explanations are always clear and direct. The way you explain functions line by line helped me understand the progression of code, with little room for misunderstanding. Your intense devotion to deeply understand code is extremely admirable. Your positive, exploratory approach is motivating and has lead to some cool extra curricular coding art pieces(like the exploding faces sprite exploration). Your humor always keeps me on my toes and laughing. No time was your humor more evident than when you spent the time to create a chatbot with curated messages about each of the students in the class; although, I changed a couple of the chatbot responses (merge request waiting). I hope to continue our coding exploration to create more awesome stuff!
