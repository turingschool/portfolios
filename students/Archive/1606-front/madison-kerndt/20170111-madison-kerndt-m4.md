##### Feedback to me from Adam Bernard:

It was AWESOME to work with Madison for a third time during the program.  She really pushed our team to make sure that we were taking risks to learn more instead of taking an easy road.  She did great at creating our comps and trying to make the best deliverable app we could.  One thing she could work on is making sure that when she wasn't able to develop of feature of the app that she either takes a step back from it or finds an alternative.  Otherwise she was great to work with and pushed the entire team to do their best on the application.

##### Feedback to me from MaryJane Valade:

After a long break from working together it was nice to finish out school as part of a team. I realized we book-ended Turing by doing our first and last projects together! You made great strides for the wellness project by helping Adam with the database and tackling the data visualizations. Even if the charts didn't quite work out due to deadlines they still added to the overall UX of the application. I am amazed at your drive and determination to learn "all the things" at such a relatively young age. You have already amassed a variety of life experiences that I see you putting to use every day and I will be excited to see where the road takes you.

##### Feedback to me from Casey Metz

I'm so glad I finally got to work with Madison! I don't think I've ever laughed so much during a project, even when facing obstacles. It felt great to fully cooperate on both the design and implementation of the project, and know that we were on the same page at every step. I attribute this to Madison's natural approachability and excellent communication skills. Madison's eye for design and instinctive sympathy for the _user_ will take her far in front-end development. My suggestion for Madison would be to take caution not to over-extend herself--she's a busy woman who happily pursues many commitments at once. She's actually done an excellent job of this while at Turing, so I'm really just suggesting that she take note of the balance she's found between ambition and reliability, and hold that balance. I'll miss siphoning inspiration and enthusiasm from Madison, and I hope we get to work together again.

##### Feedback to Adam Bernard (CAPSTONE)

Adam, I really enjoy working with you. I like your planning style & ability to recognize the MVP within the mix. I have always been impressed by your ability to truly figure out & understand problems based on the documentation. I always like how you take the time to explain your findings. My only feedback is to keep everyone in the loop. I felt that at times you were two steps ahead on a decision the group was not aware of. That said you are a badass developer. It was awesome working with you!

##### Feedback to MaryJane Valade (CAPSTONE)

I always love working with you. It has been such a joy to see how we have both grown over our time at Turing as developers. We can actually write code now! You have an amazing ability to step back and understand the problem at hand. The only feedback I have is that at times, when you encountered blocks, you devalued your ability. Stick with it girl! You are smart and capable. With a bit of research I felt that you could have figured it out. Best of luck with your future career as a developer! You are going to kick butt!

##### Feedback to Ben Godfrey (Native)

Ben, you always get shit done. There is no messing around with you. I admire how resourceful you are. I felt at times that he pushed past some valuable learning opportunities, but I was impressed by your ability to create and end product and our first React Native app. Aside from that your creativity and passion for art is AWESOME! Keep it up!

##### Feedback to Casey Metz (Imposter Syndrome)

Casey, I am so glad we got the opportunity to work together! Your calm demeanor and ability to execute are impressive. I really liked your planning style and felt that it kept us both on track. The only thing I would say is to be riskier. You have the amazing ability to understand complex topics quickly and I think it would take your apps to the next level. I hope that we have the opportunity to work together in the future!

## Professional Development

##### Priorities & Action Plan

The main goals of my career ahead stems from community involvement. My goal is to get friendly with founders, venture capitalists, and the community. I plan on approaching this through multiple avenues: meetups & conference talks, both attending and speaking, networking, and creating accessible and available work.

I plan to tackle my goals and the challenges that lie ahead by staying organized, focused and grounded. There are some challenges that I face, that I am a junior developer, that I do not have my undergraduate degree, and that I am a woman. I believe that these barriers can be addressed with recognition, strength, persistence, and understanding. I plan to overcome them  by moving forward towards my goals and uncovering weather formal education is right for me.

## Community

#### Gear Up Reflections

* [Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Through this gear up and my personal experiences with journey mapping I have realized that it all centers around empathy. As developers empathy is a key quality to ensure our products provide the most value to customers. In the future I hope to use journey mapping to accurately understand the needs of my users and, more importantly, how to fulfill them.

* [Microagression](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md)

Microagressions are a tricky topic. I had mix feelings about this gear up given our current political state. I have a difficult time reconciling the stark differences between microagressions and blatant bigoted, racist, sexist, and mean comments within our government. While I will continue to improve on my own awareness, I was left with the feeling of unfairness within our society.

* [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I feel that grit is only taking perseverance into the picture and completely neglecting passion. If you feel passionate about your path then perseverance is never bad. It is only in the case of pure perseverance that issues occur. I really liked this gear up and the discussion that we had. I realized that not everyone believes that they have grit and that it is something to continually foster and pursue.
