# Madison Kerndt - M3 Portfolio

#### Summary

I was so fortunate this module to have such amazing opportunities to connect with and contribute to my community. I hope that I honored every opportunity that was given to me as best I could. I did my best to greet every opportunity with excitement and optimism although internally I was mostly petrified.

#### Description

Due: 2016-11-9

Mixing the senses. With my personal project I wanted to attack the goal that I set out last module: to experiment with technologies learned outside of class. While I experimented with Processing in Java and D3 slightly I decided to interact with the oscillator provided in browser, the webcam, and the p5 sound library for this project. My goal was to provide a visceral experience by mixing the senses. I hoped to have accomplished this by mixing all three technologies into a react app allowing the user to interact through movement to auditory and visual output.

##### Evaluation Comments

Remember is does an amazing thing... it saves your glorious ideas! There are a couple of prominent features that lend themselves to ease of use. First the route is updated whenever a different reminder is clicked, therefore users can share their reminders with friends. Aside from this feature a user may revert save, or delete reminders as they please. The Turing team developed this app on the Ember framework and worked to exemplify effective workflow practices.

##### Feedback to me from Brett Hevia

I worked with Madison on the second project of the mod, RemEmber. Just like the first time Madison and I worked together, I found her positivity and energy infectious. I can be stubborn and reluctant to ask for help when I run into a problem, but Madisonâ€™s willingness to talk through and approach stuff from other angles really helped me open up to different approaches and problem-solving strategies.

The weather tracker app serves to deliver weather data to our end user based on their current location and their other pinned locations. This app is our first attempt at building a React application using Redux and React Router. We also accessed the information provided by two separate APIs one that finds the users current location, and the other that found accurate weather data for that location and other locations provided by the user. The application allows the user to navigate to different screens showing them data with various depth of detail. Also all state is managed in the Redux store, allowing us to pass and access state seamlessly.

##### Feedback to me from David Kerr

This was by far the most frustrating project we have had yet(my opinion), and I felt your positivity and can-do attitude really carried our team.  There were points when we were all scratching our heads and you would find another path to push forward.  That positivity really lifts up the group you are working with and empowers them to take the same initiative.  I was also impressed by your desire to understand and learn rather than just do the thing.  Those things together are a pretty great combo, so I hope to get the opportunity to work with you moving forward.

##### Feedback to me from Blake Worsley

Madison, you are a strong and talented person to work with. I really appreciated working on this project with you and getting to see your drive for other personal ambition outside of Turing this mod. I know you will be successful because of you attitude and your commitment to your goal. Keep working on narrowing down focus. Complete one goal before you undertake the next. You have already improved since our last project and I am sure you will continue to improve. It has been an absolute pleasure!

##### Feedback to me from Ben Godfrey

I had a great time working with Madison on our Weather App. She had a great approach to planning out the app, as well as making sure we set cohesive goals for our group. Madison was also very easy to communicate with, and a great source to bounce ideas off of as well. Lastly, Madison was awesome when it came to working independently. This was one of the major goals of the project and, despite not being together for a lot of it, she was always grinding to get the next thing working or to figure out the next piece of information. I really appreciated this when it came to working with her.

One area of opportunity for you Madison would be to drive more often when it comes to pairing. You're extremely skilled and articulate when it comes to communicating the ideas you'd like to try and the concepts you've already gotten, but there were times where I would have loved to see you actually code these things out so that I could better understand your thought process behind things (mostly when we weren't in person). Overall, I had a great experience working with you though and would definitely like the chance to work together again!

##Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* [Vote](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Without getting too political I thought that this gear up session did a great job of driving home the importance of unbiased information about political issues. Prior to this sessions, I had strong opinions about educated voting. Since it is the first general election I have gotten the opportunity to participate in, I have been more than thoughtful about what resources I am sourcing my information from. This gear up not only helped me to think more in-depth about the bias of the resources I have been looking at, but also introduced other valuable sources to look at.

* [Introversion](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

Surprisingly, from our discussion, I found that the majority of my classmates, including myself, fall on the introversion side of the scale. This discussion topic got me to question how much I am truly honoring the introverted side of myself. I have a tendency to push myself outward because it feels uncomfortable. It is a way I push myself to do things that are uncomfortable. Since this discussion I have been much more cognizant of the fact that I do need quiet time, which has helped me make space for it.

* [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I think resilience is a choice. Though our discussion flowed into many different discussion topics ranging from child raising, to death, to various different cultures, the idea that I have reflected on most deeply since is external support. Resilience and its origin is a very complicated and complex subject matter. I am of the opinion that resilience is a choice that is encouraged by those outside yourself, if people don't get encouragement from outside, the behavior associated with resilience will stop. More than anything this discussion made me thankful for those outside myself that have fostered resilience and more aware of ways I can foster resilience with the kids I work with.

##Feedback and Community Participation

##### Feedback to Brett Hevia (Remember)

Brett, I thought we worked efficient and effectively together on the Remember project. I admire your intensity and consistency to move forward. For this project I think we did a good job of working through the task at hand, stayed focused, and moved forward. Outside of this project, it was awesome that we got to bounce ideas off of one another in regard to jobs, profile content, and other endeavors. Thank you for all of your help and continuing to motivate me.


##### Feedback to David Kerr (Weather App)

David, I really enjoyed working with you. I like how you work to break down and understand problems efficiently and effectively. I learned a lot from your thought process. It was awesome getting to bounce ideas off of you and work through code examples to better understand redux. Although I wish I could have contributed more, I felt that our group did a good job of dividing and conquering. In the end, was impressed by your ability to wrap your head, so quickly, around such a complicated subject matter like redux. I hope we get the chance to work together next module!

##### Feedback to me from Blake Worsley (Weather App)

Blake, I am so impressed by you as a human being. You have such a strong mental fortitude, complex thought process and kind demeanor. Aside from the project you have helped me to align my priorities and accomplish what I set out to. Thank you. During our project, even though we all struggled, I thought that you had a positive outlook and worked hard to understand the concepts. I was impressed by our teams willingness to work hard and followthrough to produce an MVP for this project. It was awesome working with you!

##### Feedback to Ben Godfrey (Weather App)

Ben, I was so impressed by your consistency and determination to understand Redux. Out of the whole group I think you spent the most dedicated time and gave Redux the most concerted effort out of all of us. Although we all struggled on this project, I was so impressed by everyone's hard work, yours especially, to understand the problem at hand. It was really awesome getting the opportunity to talk through problems, theorize solutions, and work with you. I hope we can work together again in the future.
