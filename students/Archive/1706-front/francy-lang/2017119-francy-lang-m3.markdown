# Francy Lang - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Mod 3 were to: solidify my understanding of React while incorporating Redux and Router, build confidence in my skills and abilities, and gain a better understanding of how to architect and plan out the structure of an application in a scalable manner. Working on my personal project has allowed me to evaluate myself on all 3 of these goals. I definitely have a much stronger understanding of React and I feel comfortable incorporating both Redux and Router. After architecting my personal project, I know changes I would make and what I would do differently next time. Overall, I feel I have demonstrated a greater level of confidence with programming- this has been a struggle for me at Turing, but my awareness of it continues to push me and foster growth.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidjryan/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

#### Evaluator: yung-jhun && will
#### Student: Francy Lang and David Ryan
- work on making your dumb components dumb
- you need to test your app
- work on moving some logic down the stack to other dumb components

#### Specification Adherence
2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality
2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

#### PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing
2 - There are obvious gaps where functionality is not tested.

### SWAPIbox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/francylang/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

#### Evaluator: Limbo
#### Students: Francy Lang, Amy Holt
#### Comments:
* UI is clean, looks great!
* Initially cards needed to be refactored into a component, great job making that change
* Favorites still need fine tuning
  * duplicate favorites can be added
  * no ability to remove favorites
  * button doesn't show up on favorites view

#### Specification Adherence -- 
3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

#### Code Quality
3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

#### Testing
2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

#### Workflow
3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/francylang/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

#### Evaluator: Limbo
##### Students: Francy Lang, Lola Brenner, Robbie Greiner

#### Specification Adherence
4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

#### Testing
4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### 5. Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

#### Redux Architecture
4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up
#### Microagressions
*My takeaways from the Microaggression gear-up are around being advocates for others and calling out microagressions when I see them. I strongly believe strengthening an individuals self-awareness is key to activating their role as a bystander. Subtle displays of aggression are just as harmful to a community as obvious displays of aggression. I think this would actually be a great gear-up to do in mod2 so that students are exposed to the concept of microaggressions early on.* 

#### Tragedy of the Commons
*My takeaways from the Tragedy of the Commons gear-up are feelings of frustration, similar to how I felt when I left the GroupThink gear-up in mod2. I feel that both of these gear-ups were actually examples of Tragedy of the Commons and GroupThink. I don't feel like the majority understand how susceptible Turing is to these problems. In both gear-ups there was more time spent rationalizing and lawyering than there was actually discussing the potential dangers and strategies to address these issues at Turing. Diversity and inclusion are uncomfortable topics to discuss, but that's exactly why we need to discuss them. I would really like to see facilitators that are willing to push people to the levels of discomfort we need in order to stimulate change.* 

#### Mod4: Rule #6, Don't take yourself so seriously
*I really enjoyed this gear-up. It's nice to be brought back down to earth every now and again while at Turing. I have continued to try and keep things in perspective and not convince myself the world will end if things aren't perfect-- they'll never be perfect and that's okay. Always more to learn and there are always more chances to succeed.*

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
* I regularly attend Joan Clarke Society meetings. 
* I have been involved with Iron-fe and I continued to pair with mod2 students throughout the mod as I know it helps strengthen my own understanding. 
* I attended the TFA Colorado reunion as a representative for Turing, along with other Turing TFA alums.
* Recently, I did a phone interview for Turing about my career change and what it’s like being a student at Turing.
