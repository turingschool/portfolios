## Areas of Emphasis

My main focus this mod was to continue to strengthen and hone my JS skills. I found everything about the mod interesting and useful. Every project gave me a deeper understanding of JS as well as CS pricipals as a whole. I look forward to working with React more and continuing to sure up my skills.
