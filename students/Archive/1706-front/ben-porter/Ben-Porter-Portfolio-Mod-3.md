# Ben Porter - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The main focus for me in this mod was to grow my React skills, learn Redux, and continue my ability to write clean functional JavaScript. 

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
I feel very good about my end of mod assessment. Though I did not get all the way through it I hit everything functional. Do to lack of time I did not get the sworn members on the page, but I did have them saving to the store in the proper houses. Had I had another hour at the most I am confident I would have completed all parts of the assesment. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

##  Head Count 2.0
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bbp5280/headCount)

## HeadCount Eval

### Evaluator: Limbo
### Students: Ben && Amy
### Comments:
* The top scroll button is HOT FIRE!
* Look for duplicate statements (esp setState) and refactor!
* Look for large chunks of code and refactor
* Array prototypes!! If you are using a forEach to return a new array, DON'T

## Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React but demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.

## Surprise and Delight

3 - Hot Fire


## Swapi Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/SwapiBox)

## Swapi-Box Eval

### Evaluator: Limbo
### Students: Jennifer Woodson, Ben Porter
### Comments:
* Would like visual indication for user on adding and removing favorites
* Need individual API calls on specific button clicks to be passing project. -- COMPLETE! Great job making that change


### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### CSS/Design

4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3+ - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## E: Community Participation
I continued to attend meet up events. I also found a few opportunities to do my own conversations/follow alongs with a few startups outside of the turing community. Where I could I continued to help lower mods on projects and tools for making their goals. 

## Personal Project 


## PD

After trying to create my portfolio for several hours I was forced to give up. I can not set up a project for the portfolio without the personal part. 

Here is a link to my resume:
