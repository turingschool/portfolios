# Ben Module 4 (Front-end)
 ### Areas of Emphasis
 
 As I entered mod-4 I was very excited about learning the backend to fully round out my turing experience. My main goal was to extend my experties in a way that I would feel confident applying to full stack development positions though clearly with a focus on the fron-end. My other goal was to continue to build confidence in preperation for finding a job.

 ### Community
 The main ways I participated in the community this mod were through iron-FE and by attending a few meet-ups. 
 
 Our week 5 gear up was on net neutrality. I felt the gear up was very successful we had a very active group who had a wide range of understanding of the issues of net neutrality. We tried to cover both sides of the issue though we clearly carried a bias. Despite this bias there was quite a lively conversation about the pros and cons as well as next steps for those whow want to stay active in the issue.
