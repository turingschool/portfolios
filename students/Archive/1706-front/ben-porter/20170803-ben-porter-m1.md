# Ben Porter - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Not fully knowing what to expect coming in, other than a challenge,  and having very little Java Script background my main goals were to get the foundations and fundamentals as quickly as possible. I also set out to ensure continued growth throughout the mod.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bbp5280/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The project was to build a DOM based game in which a number is randomly generated between 1-100. As guesses are entered you are directed towards the number until a correct guess. Additional features were added in later phases. 

## Notes/What To Work On:

- Spacing/Indentation HTML

#### Feedback to me

Hello Ben! -- Let's kick this off by letting you know how much I appreciated your ability to dive right in and think about problem solving on the fly. It was really neat that you were able to explain in detail your thought process. I also appreciated the fact that you gave me time to understand and even practice the concepts and ideas you were able to generate. An area of opportunity that I could see, is perhaps the planning phase of the initial project. I am in no way, innocent of this myself, but it would have been helpful to perform a DTR and then come up with a more strategic plan of attack as far as the JS file was concerned. The other area is allowing ourselves a larger window of time for unforeseen challenges and areas. I think we both learned our lesson as well haha. Even if we have a solid understanding of a language, stuff can still go wrong and unexpected. To circle back around for the closing of this Feedback, I would like to thank you for your patience in working with me. I learned a lot about the strategical approach and analysis your mind operates with and will be incorporating that within the way I approach further projects. Great Work Partner! Sam Singer

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/francylang/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

A simple dom app that can record and archive ideas. Ideas are created as "cards" with titles and descriptions. Through the use of local storage they can be saved. Later phases include features to rate ideas, as well as sort them.

Functional Expectations

Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.


HTML

Accessibility

Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.

Style

Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Exceptional	Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

Conditional Logic

Advanced Beginner	Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

Functions & Scope

Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Arrays

Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github

Advanced Beginner	Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


PAIRING

Collaboration

Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### Feedback to me
Ben, thank you for being an easy partner to work with. I appreciate how patient you were with me and how you were willing to work on something until we both understood it. Something to work on would be around not being too hard on yourself. I am glad I got the chance to work with you, I learned a lot from you and enjoyed problem-solving and finding success together!

#### Idea Box Piviot/Todo Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidjryan/2DoBox-Pivot-1706)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

The main goals behind this project were to take a foreign code bace, become familiar with it, refactor it, and then piviot the code for another use. In the end the app can take and store tasks. Urther filtering, searching, tracking of progress were added.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Strength Finder
I found this to be a very interesting experience. I was very skeptical the test coud determine anything about my strenths, but was very suprised when I read the results. Since then I have found myself assessing when the traits listed are strengths and when they are messing up my balance. 

* [GitHub URL]()

#### Give and Take Feedback
This reflection on this gear up was interesting in that it made assess how I take feedback and why. Critical feedback is not rarly an issue for me unless it is coming from certain sources. 

#### Story Telling
My biggest takeaway from this gear up is that I need to force myself to be more comfortable with being uncomfortable. I need to attend more meet ups, and work on networking. 

#### Women in tech
This was an powerful and improtant gear up due to the importance of the subject. Deversity in tech of all kinds is so important. It was powerful and sad to hear the experices of the women in the video. Having a mother who didn't go to MIT because she was talked out of it by her brother it is iportant that these things get stopped. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
The main roles I played in supporting the turing community in this mod was mostly to my mod itself. Helping when and where I could, partnering etc. Moving forward I intend to be more involved as a whole, including meet ups, pairings, etc.
