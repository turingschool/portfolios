# Michael Marlow - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main focus in my second attempt of mod1 was to really lock down the material that seemed to
escape me the first time aorund. This included the ideaBox project, being a better project partner, 
having more involvement with the current mod and the larger Turing community. I also felt a need to 
help and soften the transition for the newcomers.

##### Notes/What To Work On:

Awesome, awesome work. Really great workflow. A few small tweaks on the comp matching and there are places you can easily refactor some JS. Only refactoring recommended is around breaking out functions not actually the code itself.

Functional Expectations

Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

Functional Expectations

Advanced Beginner	Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

HTML

Accessibility

Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup. Advanced Beginner	Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. Proficient	Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns. Exceptional	Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

Style

Novice	Crafts markup with proper indentation and opening/closing tags. Advanced Beginner	Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting. Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. Exceptional	Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.

CSS

Structure of Code

Advanced Beginner	Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

Implementation

Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic

Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope

Proficient	Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays

Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style

(not actually representative of ability)

Advanced Beginner	Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Novice	Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch. Advanced Beginner	Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description. Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs. Exceptional	Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers. Github

Novice	Can articulate what GitHub is, how it is different from Git, and why it is important. Can comfortably push and/or pull changes from master. Advanced Beginner	Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync. Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code. Exceptional	Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Novice	Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details. Advanced Beginner	Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint. Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions. Exceptional	Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

PAIRING

Collaboration

Novice	Can communicate needs, expectations, scheduling constraints through a DTR, effectively creating a working plan with partner. Advanced Beginner	Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan. Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. Exceptional	Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
This session was really interesting to me both times. The first time was my first real introduction into Carol Dweck and 
the concept of growth mindset (vs fixed mindset). I thought the second time around I was really able to take more from it, 
including actionable steps to apply to my work at Turing. I continue to listen for my triggers that can cause a regression into
a fixed mindset and actively seek to control how I react to those. Overall this session was a success for me and has been 
a useful tool for my growth.

#### Introvert Extrovert Ambivert
It was revealing to see the different preferences of each personality type on the spectrum. I am an introvert and I thought it was crucial
to learn the needs of different personality types - something I can apply to improve how I work with the various types so we can
produce great work together. It was also believe this gear up session was very revealing with just how nuanced each type
can be and to approach any differences as an opportunity to learn and grow together.

#### Storytelling 
I enjoyed learning just how related we all our in our reasons for coming to Turing. I also enjoyed hearing personal stories
and learning about the major lenses that various people view their world through - how different yet how important
they were to each individual. Being able to articulate what values motivate me and shedding some light on how those
are reflected in my life was something I had never done but took a lot away from that. I am still working on truly
demonstrating my values in the things I do in my life.


#### CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap
This documentary was incredible both times I watched it. I thought it was really incredible what power there was in stereotypes - especially with the experiment involving a math test for both genders. Equally fascinating was the opportunity to learn form 
the crash test dummy / airbag team - their pitfalls due to a lack of diversity in their R&D. I continue to think of ways 
I can help shape or influence the way we talk about gender and ability in order to foster a more inclusive tech industry  (and beyond)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This time around I was in a great position to give back in my current cohort. I worked really hard
early on to help everyone I could and just generally being available for anyone that needed
help or guidance towards a solution. I also spent time leading some weekend group coding sessions,
improving github and waffle workflow (with Rufus), setting up our private slack channel, sharing resources
for the various static comps, etc. It was a pleasure to be in a position to help in my second go-round
and I really appreciated the overall positive feedback I recieved from my cohort.
