#### Evaluator: Will
#### Students: Alex Banister, Nik Bornemeier, John Michael Boudreaux
#### Comments: Great job recognizing when helper functions are needed, keep going in this direction. Try to avoid double or triple looping (maps in maps in maps), and separate fetch calls into different functions.

#### Rubric

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

##### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

##### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### Rubric

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

##### CSS/Design

4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##### Testing

3+ - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

##### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

##### Routing

* 4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## D: Professional Skills

### Turing Portfolio and Resume

* [Portfolio with Resume](https://www.turing.io/alumni/alex-banister)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I try to spend as much time as I can helping my fellow classmates and making myself available for pairing and rubber ducking. I've paired often with mod 2 students to assist them and spend most of posses working with students across mods and programs working to solve code problems and learn from each other.
