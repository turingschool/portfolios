# Alex Banister - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was very excited to dive deeper into JS, new concepts, and work on larger and more complex projects.

## Rubric Scores

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: PASS
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: PASS
* **D: Professional Skills**: Yes
* **E: Community Participation**: Yes

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED

## B: Individual Work & Projects
#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexbanister/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

PASS

### Testing
* I like that you pulled in the random array generators from a separate helper file
* Was 5000 the longest length array you could run merge sort on in the 2 seconds allotted during tests?
* With merge and quick sorts, I'd like to see the random arrays being sorted have lengths of ten thousands.

### Bubble
* Since we're not using `this`, I'd like to see ES6 here.
* Nice optimization using the "sorted" boolean
* In your inner for loop, you have `i < (toSort.length - 1)`; you don't need the parentheses there :)

### Insertion
* Make friends with arrow functions :)
* Instead of using `} else { break; }`, you can just leave out the else statement.

### Merge
* Try for a `const mergeSort = (array) => {` format here

### Quick
* If you use ES6, you can export by writing `export default const [FUNCTION NAME] = (array) => {}`
* Nice use of the spread operator in your return

## Score:
Pass

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexbanister/completeMe)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

### Evaluator:
Leta

### Evaluator comments:
* Nice extension - clean CSS and UI!
* Room for refactoring; some code fragility/brittleness in structure of node children
* Great test suite, covering sad paths and moving from small scale to complex functionality

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
* 3.5:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### 5. Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexbanister/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

# Instructor: Leta
# Comments:
  * Code organization needs some work; did discuss difficulty in deciding where to put logic
  * Get rid of anonymous numbers :) Utilize parameters to reduce redundancy
  * Nice interface and fun power ups
  * Great workflow

## Functional Expectations
* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow
* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexbanister/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

PASS

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Reflections

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1706-f/alex_banister.md)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I've put a lot of effort into being available to help my cohort when they needed it and paired with mod 1 students 2-3 times a week.

## Final Review

### Notes

Great Job! 

### Outcome

Pass
