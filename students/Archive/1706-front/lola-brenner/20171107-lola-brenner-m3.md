## B: Projects

#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/mod3-personal-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Checkins and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/tree/master/1706/mod-3/personal-project/Lola-Brenner)

Comments:

Excellent testing (also great it was used as a learning tool)
Get rid of anonymous numbers :) Utilize parameters to reduce redundancy
Good code organization
Fun interface!

*Functional Expectations
3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

*User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

*Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

*JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

*Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/francylang/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

Comments:

Awesome job on accessibility!
const > let wherever possible
break things out when you see they're getting too big
CSS - strive for consistency and ensuring the user has feedback ALL THE TIME (users are dumb)

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This gear up explored the concept of microaggressions- how small actions that we are socialized to think are normal can actually be harmful.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up explored the dangers of needing to be in the majority. When people have a need to be in the majority, they automatically construct segregated environments.


#### Mod 4 Lead- Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

This gear up brought to light the ways that the stereotypical trope of masculinity is elevated in nerd culture, and ways that we can influence how all genders are represented in fandoms and also what media people consume.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Was a posse lead.
Paired with lower mod students, peers, and back end students on multiple occasions.
Started up Queer Qoders with some other students.
