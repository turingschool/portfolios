## B: Projects

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/Game-time-hs-lb-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Comments:

Excellent testing (also great it was used as a learning tool)
Get rid of anonymous numbers :) Utilize parameters to reduce redundancy
Good code organization
Fun interface!

*Functional Expectations
3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

*User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

*Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

*JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

*Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Testing

Great use of import
I like that you're putting your test helpers into a single helper file
The for loop to create assertions is great!
Good job balancing when to use it (i.e. not using the loop for testing arrays of 2 or fewer numbers)
Love that you tested your random array generator functions!
Bubble

Great use of ES6
The export default can go right before the function declaration:
export default const bubbleSort =...
GREAT bundling of your sorts into an index.js file!
Insertion

See feedback for Bubble
Merge

Try refactoring this into ES6 (don't need to do it for a score, just for your own edification)
These lets can be turned into consts without damaging your sort
newArr.push(ar1[0]); ar1.shift(); can be turned into newArrpush(ar1.shift())
since ar1.shift() returns that value :)
Quick

Nice inline solution
Again, try refactoring into ES6 for the practice
The solution from your eval is good too!
Score:

Pass

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

* 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

* 2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

* 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

* 4. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

* 5. Code Sanitation
 The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints



#### Weatherly

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Empathy and Priveledge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

We learned about different kinds of priveledge, some of which I had not previously been aware of.
We shared stories about our own experiences with priveledge and marginalization.
We talked about how to develop more empathy for those iwth less privelege.

#### Group Think

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

Group think is when a group of people develop the same opinions/mindset or adopt opinions/mindset because they are part of the group. It is a problem because it lacks a diverse perspective and discounts/discredits other views. 


#### Mod 4 Lead- The Art of Not Giving a Fuck

* [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x36cEw6gUZ8)

The art of not giving a fuck is about prioritizing what you value and distributing time/money/energy accordingly. It is also about being empowered to say no to things you do not value, i.e. baby showers. 

## E: Community Participation
