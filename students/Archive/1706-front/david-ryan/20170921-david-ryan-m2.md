 Comments: None.
 
 None
 
 *Functional Expectations
 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
 
 *User Interface
 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
 
 *Testing
 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
 
 *JavaScript Style
 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

 *Workflow
 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

 *Code Sanitation
 The output from ESLint shows…
 4 - Zero complaints

 ## D: Professional Skills
 
 ### Gear Up
 #### Empathy and Privelege
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

 We dicussed privelege and the conversation turned to when we all first became disillusioned with the status quo and how that impacted us through our young adult 
 
 #### Group Think
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)
 
 AKA Herd mentality.  Fact check fact check fact check haha.  It amazes me how prevelent this phenomenon is and how aweful the repercussions can be ...current president case and point
 
 #### Mod 4 Lead- Tranhumanism
 
 This discussion centered around how we as humans will continue to integrate tech into our biological make-up.  While I think this will be inevitable there were a number of people in the session that were quite opposed to the idea.  I did my best to steer the conversation towards getting over the initial apprehension one might have towards the notion and move more in the direction of admitting its inevitabilty and begin a discussion about the ethics that will be sorely needed as we move into this tech future.  I stradle the middle of this topic and simply prefer to begin talking about how to best go about the development of transhumanism rather than waste time agruing against it as if it will never be a thing.
 
 ## E: Community Participation
 
 ### Playing a Part
 
 Paired with Mod 1 students.
 Paired with classmates to help.
 Readily available on slack for Mod 1 student questions.
 Iron-Fe participation
 Brought in some food
 Coached Mod 1 students on how to navigate the last few weeks and how to best use time over break to prepare for mod 2
