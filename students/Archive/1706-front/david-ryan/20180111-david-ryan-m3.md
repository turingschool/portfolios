 ### D: Professional Skills
 
 ### Gear Up Reflections:
 
 * [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)
 The Microaggressions gear up introduced the variety of ways in which microaggressions happen on a daily basis. By clarifying the types of situations in which microaggressions often occur we can confront and resolve these microaggressions. This will help create an environment in which people of all walks of life feel comfortable and respected.
 
 
 * [Attention Economy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)
 This one hit close to home. Being a video gamer especially brings this topic into focus. It went over how tech companies have a vested interest in capturing our attention and time so it can be monetized. Videogames are a massive perpetrator of this phenomenon. The big question?  Who/what do you sell your time to.
 
 * [Learning From the Struggle](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_2.md)
 This student led gear up went over grit, its importance and how grit is the single biggest indicator of success.  Strategies to cultivate grit were explored, etc.  This was one of the most personally emporing gear-ups i;ve been to and I was thrilled to have participated.
 
 ### E: Community Participation
 
 Playing a Part
 Feeling the pressure of repeating left me with little time to really deidicate to the community.  Next mod I plan on possibly leading a blockchain student group and participating more directly with my posse.
