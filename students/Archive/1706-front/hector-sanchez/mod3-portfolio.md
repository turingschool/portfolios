# (Hector A. Sanchez) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

(I set out to gain a better understanding of unit testing, of React; Redux and Router.  My knowledge of testing has vastly expanded
as we were required to test every project that we built throughout this module.  I've become more comfortable with React, Redux, and Router and overall
I have gained more confidence in myself in knowing that I am becoming a skilled front end developer.)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (ProjectMe)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/ProjectMe)

(This is my self directed project.  I created the app to be a daily source of motivation and inspiration.  The app
also allows a user to create goals and keep track of them.)

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Headcount2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

(Rufus and I built this application as a team.  We made api calls to retrieve public shool data and rendered the the data to
the UI.  We succeeded in testing every component and as much functionality as we could.  I learned a lot from working with Rufus.)

#### (SwappiBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

(This application was built by Robbie and I.  We did not use Redux to make this application, only used React.  This was our
first attempt in using fetch mock in unit testing which was a great learning experience.  The project was a success and I 
enjoyed working with Robbie.  He really pushed me throughout the whole project, I felt very challenged.)

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

(This was the first experience that I had with working on a project with more than 2 people.  Jennifer and Jason were my partners
and this was our first time implmenting Redux and Router in the application development process.  Completing this project
helped solidfy my understanding of Redux and I really enjoyed working with Jennifer and Jason.)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

### Storytelling Continued.

This gear up session really helped me narrow down exactly what I wanted my listener to take away from me as I'm
telling my story about what lead me on the path of becoming a software developer.  We had a session where we were able
to practice telling our story to another individual and being able to do that was great practice.  I hadn't had a chance to 
tell my story until that day.

### Microaggressions

This gear up was very thought provoking.  What I was able to take away from this gear up session was that as an individual 
I should always contribute in making sure that my work environment is inclusive and socially supportive.  I should be 
conscience about how I communicate with others to make sure that I don't trigger any microaggressions.  I should take a stand
whenever I notice that someone is creating a negative work environment for other individuals.

### Flower Exercise

Allison introduced us to the flower exercise to compel us to really think about what we want our future careers as 
software developers to look like.  The exercise was very helpful in helping me organize myself and define exactly
what is it that I want in my future career.

### Finding Opportunites

During this gear up session we discussed how to best expand our job search opportunities beyond solely relying on 
job boards and job listings.  We discussed how cold outreaches can be beneficial and strategies on how we can approach people
using the cold outreach method.  We discussed going to meetups to network with people and how critical it is to research 
a company and its members as a means of assiting with job hunting.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(Helped mod 2 and mod 1 students whenever I could.  This mod was very hard and it was difficult to help others
when we had a lot of work on our hands.)
