# (Hector A. Sanchez) - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

(I set out to prepare myself as much as I could to be able to hit the ground running in terms of job search.
I wanted to have a solid prepared resume, cover letter(s), and Turing hire a grad portfolio. I realize that I still
need to go back and refactor projects to have them ready for potential employer showcasing.  I also need to review a lot of 
material to prep me for interviewing.  I also set out to learn as much as I could about every new subject 
that we learned in mod 4.  I'm very excited and happy with the material that we covered and I'd like to continue reviewing
everything I learned this mod to strengthen my understanding.)

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (PalettePicker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-palette-picker)

(This is the first project that I was assigned.  It was my first attempt at building a backend that
interacts with a front end using Express.js with Knex.  I felt great about the project after finishing, 
i gained a lot of knowledge about working with Express and testing endpoints.)

(evaluation comments)
Be sure to add .gitignore early on in your project and include .DS_Store files
Would expect smaller, more atomic commits

(evaluation scores)
Final Score: 117 / 150
* [Assignment scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-4/palette-picker/hector-a-sanchez-palette-picker.md)

#### (BYOB)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-palette-picker)

(This project furthered my understanding of building a backend, building schemas, endpoint testing, and I really
enjoyed creating an endpoint that gives a user the ability to pass in parameters to query for data that meets the param requirements.)

(evaluation comments)
This should be in your .gitignore file
23 commits is definitely not enough for a project of this scope and size. You should have at least over 100. You should be committing smaller changesets more frequently.
Would be good to see some use of github issues for tracking what needs to be done
You should squash any repetitive commits like 'Update README'
This isn't a very helpful commit message. Line 66 means nothing to me, and it won't be line 66 forever as you start editing your application.

(evaluation scores)
Final Score: X / 150
* [Assignment scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-4/byob/hector-byob.md)

## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects

(Intro)

#### (HouseOfVars)

(This was the first experience that I had with working on a project with more than 2 people.  Jennifer and Jason were my partners
and this was our first time implmenting Redux and Router in the application development process.  Completing this project
helped solidfy my understanding of Redux and I really enjoyed working with Jennifer and Jason.)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Student Led Gear Up - Be Your Own Ally

(I thought that leading a gear up was a wonderful experience.  It was a fun process working with my
other classmates in outlining a plan of how we would lead it.  I really enjoyed taking part 
in the discussions that the students had in our gear up and I loved that they all seemed immersed in the subject.
I think student lead gear ups should continue on as a Turing tradition for every mod 4 student in the future.)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(Didn't do much community involvement, helped two students in mod 3 with their projects.)
