## A: End of Module Assessment
# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:
- good use of key commands
- get Spectacle or Divvy to maximize screen real estate
- had to prompt to get taken along on the programming journey, more than willing to explain if I asked, but didn’t take me along until I reminded them.
- solid handle on JS/jQuery syntax
- got into localStorage!
- biggest comment is more communication. Nicely done!
- great job using the dev tools to understand and navigate
------------------------------------------------------------------
## JAVASCRIPT
#### Data Types
* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
#### Conditional Logic
* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
#### Functions & Scope
* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
#### Style
* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
------------------------------------------------------------------
## COLLABORATION
* __Advanced Beginner__
* __Proficient__
------------------------------------------------------------------
## DEBUGGING
#### Dev Tools/Debug Process
* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

#### Arrays
* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
#### Objects & Prototypes
* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
#### Style
* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
------------------------------------------------------------------
## TESTING
#### Test Comprehension
* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp 3
## Evaluator: Brenna
## Optional Notes:
## HTML
#### Accessibility
|Proficient         | Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns. |
#### Style
|Proficient         | Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. |
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------
## CSS
#### Structure of Code
|Proficient         | Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. |
#### Implementation
|Proficient         | Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. |
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------
## DESIGN
#### Comp Recreation
|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|
#### Design Concepts
|Proficient         | Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.  


## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Description
Build HTML and CSS to match the given composition image. Create a number guessing game that allows the user to set the range and provides feedback if the number is too large or too small.

#### Evaluation Comments
Great job!
Pixel perfect match of the comp (WAHOO!)
Love the initialize/start page, it needs a little polish to make it really clear for users -- get it in front of a few people and let their feedback guide your adjustments.
Total ownership of the codebase, was able to answer and explain all questions and suggestions made, all choices in the code were carefully considered and implemented.
extremely thoughtful about execution and craft of the code
work on including ARIA/accessibility in HTML!

#### Evaluation Scores
Comp - Exceptional
HTML - Proficient
CSS - Proficient
Javascript - Proficient

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Description
Not an object based list, but a web app that stores links in a list. The list allows cards to be added, flagged as read, and removed. We added counters and mass delete functions.

#### Evaluation Comments
Awesome, awesome work. Really great workflow. A few small tweaks on the comp matching and there are places you can easily refactor some JS. Only refactoring recommended is around breaking out functions not actually the code itself.

#### Evaluation Scores

#### Feedback to Me

I really enjoyed this project, and it felt like a great even-share partnership. Your skillset for project management and git workflow was a huge part of our success, and I truly learned a lot from you. In future pair projects, I would continue to leverage these skills while being mindful of what level of comfort your partner might have using kanban/github/project workflow.

### ideaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Description
This project worked with local storage to create a group of individual ideas displayed on the screen. The idea 'cards' have options to rate the idea, and allows live editing of the card. There is a search field that allows for live searching of the cards entered, filtering the displayed list.

#### Evaluation Comments
No Eval comments

#### Feedback to Me

Hey Rufus loved being your partner I learned a lot from you on idea box. I feel like you helped to solidify my knowledge of git hub and helped me to be less cloudy on javascript. I guess one thing that you could work on is your availability I feel like we could have worked a bit more on idea box and got the css really dialed in. Other wise you're a really awesome teacher and really have a firm grasp on the material. Working with you is always a great experience 10/10 would work again.

### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/2dobox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Description
This project began with an existing code base for ideaBox. The goal was to convert the idea tracker to a to-do list. The application continued to work with local storage, search, and have 'card' edit and voting features. The expansions of the project allowed filtering cards by quality and changing the number of cards displayed on the screen. This project was completed without any nested conditionals by creatively using arrays and JQuery DOM concatenation.
