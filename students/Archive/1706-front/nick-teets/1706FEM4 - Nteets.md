# Nick Teets - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to focus on finishing my studies strong at Turing over seeking a job while in the program. I wanted to gain as much knowledge about back-end engineering as I make my way into the job hunt because I don't want to be limited to only front-end careers. I feel that I was getting burnt out near the end of my time at Turing and learning back-end concepts reinvigorated my desire to continue learning.

## B: Required Projects

Module 4 had four required projects: Capstone, House of Vars, Palette Picker and BYOB.

#### Construction Forms - Capstone Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiegreiner/construction-forms-web-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Construction Forms is a simple form submission and management system using PostgreSQL and Node.js for the back-end, and user applications built for the web with React and mobile with React Native.

#### Speedrunning Database - Build Your Own Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/francylang/byob)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

In this paired project my partner and I scraped data from speedrun.com to build an API with RESTful endpoints and thorough testing.

#### WikiEduDashboard - House of Vars

* [House of Vars Blog Post](https://medium.com/techtrument/an-open-source-adventure-34a1b747fe6e)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

My group was assigned to contribute to the Wikipedia Education Dashboard, a web application for organizing coursework around Wikipedia. We dealt with managing a large codebase and ended up making changes to the applications linting rules. The blog I wrote was featured on the Medium publication Techtrument.   

#### Palette Picker - Build Your Own Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/palette-picker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

Palette Picker was my first back-end application, and made the process of understanding the back-end much clearer. I was excited to code in jQuery again, and feel more confident in my skills writing JavaScipt without a library like React to assist me. While the front-end design needs more work, this is the project I am most excited to share from Mod 4.

### Gear Up - Tech in the Media

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_5.md)

The gear up we led went so well we had to remove content from the lesson plan! I think out topic was very relevant with the rise of bitcoin and the passing of the repeal of net nuetrality recently. I enjoyed working on the lesson plan but would have appreciated more of a team effort from my group. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

- Led IronFE sessions weekly
- Gave a lightning talk during wrap up
- Led Lovelace Posse
