* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: Pass
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: Pass
* **D: Professional Skills**: Pass
* **E: Community Participation**: Pass

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

###### Dom Manipulation - pass
###### Creatures challenge - pass
###### Quizlette - pass
###### Static Comp 3 - pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

While I worked hard to create a solid foundation of Javascipt fundamentals, I utilized my spare time to work through CSS practices to make sure my skills on both ends of the front end engineering curriculum were at their best. I spend time doing individual research on subjects I didn't understand or wanted to learn more about, while helped me gain a greater understanding for web design and computer science as a whole.  

#### Mythical Creatures

* https://github.com/nicktu12/nt-javascript-foundations
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations

The purpose of these exercises was to implement object manipulation and array prototypes to change properties on objects in a TDD enviornemnt.

#### Static Comp 1

* https://github.com/nicktu12/nt-comp-challenge-1
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

The goal of this assignment was to create a static site using HTML and CSS that is true to the given comp while responsive on smaller screens. I took liberties with the content of my site, but the layout had to stay true to the comp layout.

#### Static Comp 3

* https://github.com/nicktu12/nt-comp-challenge-3
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

The goal of this assignment was to exemplify mastery over CSS and HTML styling by creating a page with lots of unique buttons and elements, and to make this page responsive on small screens. While the layout is true to the original comp, I took liberties with the content and slight layout changes to make room for a hero image.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In my group projects I had a chance to work on code with my classmates, which led to lots of experiential learning. While I enjoyed working with my classmates and learning from my project partners, I found it difficult to not be in control of the whole project, and had to learn to trust my partners' abilities in completing their part of the project. 

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/nicktu12/numberGuesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

The goal of this project was to begin working with Javascipt functionality while manipulating the DOM to create a simple game out of guessing numbers.

##### Partner Feedback

Jacob - Nick was an awesome partner, plain and simple. He was always available and very sharp individual. He noticed I was struggling with some of the material and took time to explain things to me and made sure I wasn't left behind. There were some moments at first where I felt left behind and left out of the JavaScript parts, and this is an area where his ability to slow down and take time to explain things could continue to be developed. 10/10 would partner again!

#### IdeaBox

The goal of this project was to build on Javascript and CSS skills whil implementing local storage functionality.

But we killed it. 

##### Partner Feedback

Amy - I was so excited to be paired with Nick because he is so cool and collected. I felt like we had a great DTR and appreciated that he was clear on what he needed and his goals. He was organized and had a great game plan that made me feel confident about the direction we were heading in and the work distribution. He was also very patient and helpful while I was learning to navigate GitHub. The only thing I would encourage Nick to consider is how he communicates specifically about code - I think he was a bit above me and JM in our understanding of the concepts and sometimes we had a hard time keeping up! Nick was such a reliable partner and overall I am proud of the work and learning we all did together.

JM - I only have small constructive things. Nick gets very excited when he is coding and almost gets lost in his own head, but stays positive and always finds an answer.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* https://github.com/nicktu12/2DO-box

The goal of this project was to pivot to slightly different functionality while refactoring someone else's code.

##### Partner Feedback

Jen - Hi Nick, I very much enjoyed working with you on TODOBox! I felt you took the lead and kept us organized and on task. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on some CSS styling (eventhough I broke it all right before eval!). I also enjoyed our strategy, where we came together for major decisions and any help we may have needed, but then we delegated tasks and worked independently. This really fit my preferred workstyle. I really must commend you for your leadership during this project. I struggled some and felt I was slow to get in PRs. However, I could always count on you to have your work done well and on time. I encourage you to just keep doing whatever you're doing as far as practice and study habits. You seem to have a great grasp on javascript, jquery, and css. You are a leader in our class, and we can all learn from what you have to offer. Fantastic work! ~Jen


## D: Professional Skills

I realized a lot of the skills I possess from my StrengthsFinder results. While I agreed that I possessed those skills, I began to recognize them through my paired coding projects, and where some of my strengths and weaknesses lie. I have also begun to think about my identity as a developer and my skills as a storyteller to tell my personal journey to web development. 

### Gear Up
#### Mod 1 Gear Up: Growth Mindset

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown

This Gear Up taught me the importance of growth mindset. I've always felt that I am opened minded and possess a growth mindset, and this Gear Up confirmed these things for me. 

#### M1 Gear Up: Working Styles

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown

This Gear Up made me realize that I am more of an extrovert in the Turing enviorment, when in the past I've been very introverted. It was informative to learn about the different personality styles, and how to respect each others' working styles in a way that compliments your own. 

#### Gear Up: Story Telling and Strengths

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_retrospective.markdown

This Gear Up taught me the skills to tell my story and establish my identity as a developer. I was able to practice talking about myself in a professional enviornment, and hope to continue to practice these storytelling techniques through my time at Turing. 

#### 	Gear Up: Debugging the Gender Gap

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md

This Gear Up reinforced the knowledge of the gender gap in STEM fields. It is very unfortunate that some people do not feel comfortable in the places that they work. It's my job to stand up for those people whose voices are less heard and to fight againt injustices where I live and work. 

#### 	Community Gear Up: How to hack an election

* https://gist.github.com/caward12/9b45791a4645995522b4469ab4e53ed9

I was very interested in this subject due to the outcome of the election. We looked at some technologies that are contributing to spin and fake news. Addtionally, we talked about the moral debate of censoring fake news versus freedom of speech.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I enjoyed exploring the different communities within Turing, including the runners group, game time group and iron-fe group. Additionally, I was able to give back to turing by helping teach my classmates during paired projects and the week before pentathalon.
