# 1706FEM2 - Nick Teets Mod 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to continue good study habits to stay on top of the curriculum. I set out to help module 1 students by providing multiple pairing sessions a week, as well as present myself as an approachable programmer that no one would feel apprehensive about approaching. I also wanted to work more with my classmates and learn each individuals's learning styles.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During this module, we had 4 projects: Game-Time, Sorting Suite, Complete-Me, and Weathrly. Game-Time and Weathrly were paired projects and Sorting Suite and Complete-Me were individual projects.

#### (Sorting Suite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The project assignment was to build 4 sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

I struggled with this project and developing code on my own to solve these sorting problems. While I couldn't solve merge sort on my own, I was able to whiteboard the data flow and call stack of the algorithm and begin to understand how it worked. I nearly completed quick sort on my own after understanding merge sort, and finally solved it during a pairing session with Franklin, a student support staff member.

The feedback from this project was positive concerning some of the algorithm optimizations and code organization. However, some of the code was not written in ES6 syntax, and the testing suite was bloated. 

#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

The project focused on building an autocomplete prefix trie and comprehension of data structures.

Understanding data structures was another stuggle for me this module. However, through diligent research and participating in live coding sessions building data structures, I feel comfortable in navigating and building data structures.

The feedback on this project focused on SRP and code refactoring, while I recieved complements on extending my project by building a front-end.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Projects included Game-Time and Weathrly. Both projects were week and a half long timeframes.

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project focused on object oriented programming fundamentals and HTML canvas to build a classic game. 

The feedback on this project focused on the logical parts of our code and utilizing the concepts of OOP more efficently. The design of our app was praised as well as our use of ES6 syntax. Additionally, our code organization and testing suite were highlights of our positive feedback as well.

My partner's feedback to me was to take more breaks during long coding sessions. Many times during paired sessions we would get too wrapped up in our work to take breaks, and would fatigue faster than if we had taken breaks. 

#### (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project focused on learning React, Enzyme/Jest testing, and API calls by building a weather app, which drew from the Weather Underground API. 

Our app design was very well recieved, and while our app did work, we did not implement the most efficient componenet structure. We were also rending components when we could have simply updated the current components using CSS on our media queries. Lastly, our testing suite was incomplete upon turing in the project, but was able to update our project with testing for total functionality of our app. 

[Eval Scores]https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-2/weathrly/sam_nick.md

My partner's feedback for me was positive, and focused on my conceptual understanding of code and being able to explain it. I provided constructive cristism to my partner concerning our workflow when a broken branch was merged onto the master.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### (Empathy and Priviledge)

* [GitHub URL](
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

This gear up provided an opportunity to discuss privledge at length in a small group setting. Our conversation focused on the perspective of history in terms of white priviledge. 
Our small group was made up of cis white males, and while it was intersting to discuss our own privledges and how that has affected our lives, it would have been enlightening to have a different voice in our group. Our final discussion as a whole class allowed for many of these voices to be heard. 

#### (Groupthink)

* [GitHub URL](
 https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

This session was informative in the faciliated discussion of groupthink. It was especially interesting to hear feedback on the lesson itself from some of the more outspoken students. While the conversations had as a class brought up a lot of things to consider about groupthink, the small group I was assigned to seemed to get too hung up on some of the details of the article we read prior to the discussion. 

#### (Mod 4 GearUp- Transhumanism)

This module 4 led session allowed for a vibrant discussion on the ethics of transhumanism and deviated from the lesson to allow for this talk. The session was excellently faciliated, and has left me wondering about the implications of transhumanism brought up during the discussion.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this inning, I provided multiple pairing sessions a week as well as leading a class live coding of a mythical creatures example for module 1. I also spent more time this module assisting my classmates by pairing with them and working through problems on the whiteboard.
