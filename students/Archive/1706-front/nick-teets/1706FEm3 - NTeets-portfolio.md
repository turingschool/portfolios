# 1706FEM3 - Nick Teets Mod 3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to build a strong foundation for building applications in React. I also set a goal to be more active in the community and spend more time in pairing sessions for students in early modules.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed!

## B: Projects

During this module, we had 4 projects: HeadCount 2.0, SWAPIbox, MovieTracker and a personal project of our own focus.

#### (HeadCount 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

The project assignment was to build a visual interface that displayed different sets of information from a large dataset in React.

This project helped me refine my skills working in React and managing datasets. I was very pleased with the design of the application, which was build in a short span and recieved positive feedback. 

[Eval Scores]https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-3/HeadCount2.0/nick-johnmichael.md

The feedback from this project was positive around the functionality and design of the application, but the application could have been more thoroughly tested.  

#### (SWAPIbox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project focus was to build a visual interface for displaying data from the Star Wars API, and to learn to manage asynchoronous JS in React.

This project was stressful due to the short amount of time allotted, but I was very proud of the application that my partner and I built, and was impressed with the workflow of my project partner and me. 

[Eval Scores]https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-3/swapi-box/nick-lola.md

The feedback on this project was mostly positive, but areas of improvement needed around code quality and testing API calls.

Project partner feedback: Nick, you were a delight to work with. It was great to be paired with someone whose brain works similarly and is always on the same page as me. You were a reliable partner and relentless problem solver. I loved that you were courageous enough to tackle new technologies (router and fetchmock). I would, however, advise both of us to get more comfortable with debugger (i.e. use it more). I feel like debugger likely would have helped us with Promise.all. Otherwise, with the timeline we had and the scope of the project, I can't think of anything we should have done differently. I would be ecstatic to work with you in the future.

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project served as an introduction to Redux, and focused on displaying data from a movie database. 

Learning the Redux flow was certainly difficult, but I was paired with a strong programmer who was able to push me in my comprehension of the library.

Feedback on this project focused on code quality and design implementation.

#### (Statify)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nicktu12/spotify-app)
* [Original Assignment](-)

This project's goal was to design a visual interface that a Spotify user could use to interact with their personalized listening statistics. 

The login flow for this app led to a slow start, but was very proud of the design and implementation of the application. As I continue to build out functionality, I realize that my code quality could be improved (reusable components).

[Eval Scores]https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/tree/master/1706/mod-3/personal-project/NTpersonal-project

Feedback on this project praised the design and functionality of the application, but urged a focus on testing. 

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### (Microaggressions)

* [GitHub URL](
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This gear up sparked a conversation in my cohort that has continued since the session was over. Learning about microaggressions and being aware that they happen has certainly changed the way I have thought about my interactions in professional and personal enviornments. 

#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](
 https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This gear up provided and opportunity to see how web technologies can be used as a learning tool, and led to a really great discussion about comfort levels and being around people who are different from you. I really enjoyed the chance to discuss with students I had never met before. 

#### (Mod 4 GearUp- Blockchain)

This gear up focused on blockchain tech and how it is changed different fields. I enjoyed the group live coding and discussion parts of this gear up. 

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this inning, I focused on being a resource for other students. I made sure to spend time pairing with students in my cohort, leading Iron FE sessions and pairing with students in lower modules. I also sat in on a student Q & A panel for a Try Turing event.
