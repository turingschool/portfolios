# Jorge Ed PerezGa - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

Firstly, I wanted to dedicate myself to learn as much javascript and react. I quickly learned that module 2 requires dedication and visualization, two of our projects had no user interface. Secondly, and most importantly, I wanted to help as many people in module one as possible. Last module, I received very much help and support that it only felt right to do the same in return. I believe that do this is the heart of Turing School's mission.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think I satisfied the requirments to move on to mod 3.

## B: Group Work & Projects
(Intro)

#### (Game Time)

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This challenging first project required us to use canvas. This project also allowed me to learn that I eventually want to create original games.

#### (Sorting Suite)

Pass

#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

#### (Weatherly)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was on the schedule every week to pair with mod 1. Additionally, I paired with Back-End students to help with css and design. Towards the end of the module, I was interviewed by Back-End instructor, Ilana Corson, to promote Turing in social media.
