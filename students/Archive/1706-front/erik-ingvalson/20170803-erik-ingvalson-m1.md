# Erik Ingvalson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module, I was looking to learn the basics of front-end web development, while developing a routine to learn how to code more efficiently. Since I was re-peating this mod, another area of emphasis was to learn JS and jQuery, how to pass mythical creatures, and DOM manipulation.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Static Comp #1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erik0110/static-comp1)
* [Original Assignment](https://erik0110.github.io/static-comp1/)

(description)
A page similar to a resume. The layout changes dramatically on a mobile.

(evaluation comments)
Careful with fonts. Got a little crowded when on mobile layout. Hover states were a bit much on mobile.

(evaluation scores)
Passed

#### Static Comp #2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erik0110/Static-Comp2-1706)
* [Original Assignment](https://erik0110.github.io/Static-Comp2-1706/)

(description)
A page with several cards that contain content of different users. The page consists of a header with a navigation bar. The mobile layout is necessary as well.

(evaluation comments)
Background could use some opacity. The cards could use some breathing room. The Logos on the header could use some space, especially on mobile layout.

(evaluation scores)
Passed

#### Static Comp #3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erik0110/Static-Comp3-1706)
* [Original Assignment](https://erik0110.github.io/Static-Comp3-1706/.)

(description)
A page for a user and their job details. The page consisted of a navigation-side-bar, a search-bar, several graphs, links, and a table. 

(evaluation comments)
Need to include hover states. Another breakpoint for mobile layouts and need to fix spacing on large screens.

(evaluation scores)
Passed

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-1/number-guesser/erik-ingvalson.md)
* [Original Assignment](https://erik0110.github.io/number-guesser1706/)

(description)
A game that the user had a limited number of guesses to find a random generated number that increses with difficulty.

(evaluation comments)
Good job!
Be mindful of details of comp
work on including ARIA/accessibility in HTML!
work on your comfort speaking about code and your thought process. You said you built it solo (with a little bit of pairing help on one feature -- awesome!!!), but then were a little hesitant to really dig in and talk about it. Own your code! You got this, be proud of all the hard work you've put in and how much you've accomplished!
You have made so much progress! Keep it up!!!
(evaluation scores)

(feedback to me)
Proficient accross the board. Met the expectations to pass phase 3.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1706/mod-1/linked-list/ErikIngvalson-AmyHolt.md)
* [Original Assignment](https://erik0110.github.io/link.list/)

(description)
An app that kept a bookmark of sites that you need to visit/have already visited.

(evaluation comments)
Continue the refactoring of functions - really great start. When making comp changes, it's a good safty practice to send the proposed or made changes to the 'client'.

(feedback to me)
Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
Bug with the regex, instructor was not able to fix therefor doesn't count (haha).
Proficient in all aspects except for GitHub, where we scored novice.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/lolakoala/idea-box)

(description)
An app that you can store ideas and rank the quality of each idea.

(evaluation comments)
lola showed off all the things being stored in the console, and had a very well planned presentation of the project
erik did css
lola did js
css and html super clean and well executed! one single redundant line of css, and one instance of a ‘0px’ that could have been a ‘0’

(feedback to me)
Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
We scored exceptional in comp design and collaboration, and scored proficient in the rest.

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://cache123.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/)

(evaluation comments)

(feedback to me)
We scored exceptional in collaboration and design and scored proficient in the rest.
## D: Professional Skills

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

It was kind of hard to be part of the Turing community in mod1 (even repeating). All of your free-time is devoted to coding or going over notes, and studying. I did however remain friends with my old cohort and met a lot of people in other mods. I went to a few of the off-campus gatherings as well.

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

Now is the time to ramp up the workload ON YOUR OWN TIME. 
Commit to getting here an hour early EVERY MORNING to do something you already know. Mythical creatures/redo Ideabox etc/Old evals
IronFE and Pairing with Mod 1

### Outcome

Pass
