MOD 3 PORTFOLIO

###Jason Hughes - M3 Portfolio
 
 ## Areas of Emphasis
  My goals this mod were to get more confident with Javascript fundamentals and React. Then, learn redux and be able to implement all three of these things together to build clean, functional apps.

Evaluator: Limbo

Students: Jason && Lola

Comments:

Awesome job on accessibility!
const > let wherever possible
break things out when you see they're getting too big
CSS - strive for consistency and ensuring the user has feedback ALL THE TIME (users are dumb)
Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React but demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested.

Surprise and Delight

4 - Unicorn

 # SWapi-Box Eval

### Evaluator: Jhun
### Students: Jason and Sam
### Comments:

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

<!-- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested -->
<!-- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing -->
2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

<!-- 4 - Zero complaints -->
<!-- 3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints -->
1 - More than ten complaints

### Workflow


<!-- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up. -->

2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3.75: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

// want to see redirect working...

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
 
 ## D: Professional Skills
 ### Gear Up
 #### Microagressions
 *My takeaways from the Microaggression gear-up are around being advocates for others and calling out microagressions when I see them. Everyone is different and have had different experiences in the past. It's important to keep in mind that something your say 100 times to your friends, may have a serious impact on a certain individual. It's important to be mindful of what you say and how you say it. 
 
 #### Tragedy of the Commons
 * Tradedy of the Commons was an interesting gear up. It really highlighted how important diversity is in the world, and for the field we are all getting into.
