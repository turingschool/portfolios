# Jason Hughes - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During my first module here at Turing, I was looking to get a solid foundation of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm amazed how much I was able to learn over the course of five weeks. I wanted to create a solid network with people in my mod, and other mods. I feel like we got pretty lucky with our mod, being that we are all very different people, who mold together nicely. In addition, I wanted to do my best to keep up a consistent schedule outside of Turing. Overall, I feel like this has been a great start to my career as a web developer!

## A: End of Module Assessment

I beleive that I passed all the end of module assessments.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

'Number Guesser' was our only individual full-scale application project for the module that required the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to the Number Guesser, I also completed three static comps which are fully responsive websites, but do not have any JavaScript functionality. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project involved building a user-focused number-guessing game, through the application of basic html, css, and javascript principles. Upon initial page load, the site displays several input fields for setting a minimum and maximum number range, a field for inputting the user's guess, and also buttons to assess whether the guess is correct, to clear the field, and to reset the entire game. If the user guesses a number that is too low, the page will display the user's guess, as well as text indicating that the guess is too low. If the number is too high, the page will display its corresponding text to indicate such to the user. If the guess is correct, the user receives the message, "BOOM." The user can reset the game at any time if s/he wishes. If the user changes the minimum or maximum values mid-game, the range will change automatically, thus effecting a reset. In future, the game will be updated to include additional features, such as adding additional levels of difficulty for the user, by increasing the number range with each successful guess.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects completed in Mod 1 were: Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBoxPivot.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project consisted of creating several input fields that would potentially allow a user to build a list of bookmarked links, to be read at a later time. After a user inputs the website title and the web url, the user can click enter, and a bookmark will be generated. Each bookmark also offers the ability to be marked as read, or removed completely from the list. There is also a button to clear all read bookmarks. A counter at the top of the page keeps a tally on total bookmarks, as well as read and unread links. The site is fully responsive and can be viewed on large or small screens as well as mobile. It is also fully functional.

#### Idea-Box 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project we were asked to create an application to keep track of thoughts and ideas. The project involved use of HTML and CSS, jQuery and javascript, along with the integration of JSON and Local Storage. When the page loads, focus is immediately placed on the title input, allowing easier access for the user to begin inputting ideas.

Notes:

Watch out copy pasta -

Functional Expectations

Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML

Accessibility

Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.

Style

Don't introduce html that you don't need
Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

Exceptional	Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic

Proficient	Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope

Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Arrays

Exceptional	Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github

Exceptional	Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING

Collaboration

Exceptional	Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.




#### 2DoBoxPivot 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonhughes1/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project involved a pivot on a previous project (IdeaBox). We were given another team's code base and our goals were to refactor the code base and fix any broken functionality and add any missing functionality from the original specifications. In addition, there were new pieces of functionality to be implemented. This application allowed us to practice using jQuery and javascript for logic and DOM manipulation, and the use of JSON/LocalStorage. We also got to hone our skills in shortening our code, and finding alternative solutions to make our code more concise.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/jasonhughes1/60224a8e4e87eda1becee7966b35d776)

I thought the Growth Mindset gear up session was very interesting. The session made me realize that I often fall into the category of a fixed mindset. Its important to always believe in yourself and not let negative thoughts get the best of you, especially in a program as difficult as Turing. 

#### Working With Introverts and Extroverts

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/jasonhughes1/a0a8d2d745af05a551af806c23e7c0d1)

This was a really interesting session. I realized I identify more as an extrovert because I tend to be more energized around people. It was great getting to talk to other people about how they work best, and whether they identify as an introvert/extrovert, and why. This was a great session to learn about one another and spark many interesting conversations. 

#### Strengths and Story Telling

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/jasonhughes1/25ff9e50892a04d8b13adf3b986fa3f9)

This was probably my favorite gear up because it was a great time to get to know classmates on a deeper level. This really made me think about my "why" and how I came to join Turing. I tell my story in bits and pieces all the time, but it was a good challenge trying to put all pieces together on a larger scale. 


#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/jasonhughes1/761d4eec377698920f29352e0ec6cdaf)

This session was great. I had no idea the numbers were so low for women in tech. It really stuck with me when they mentioned that airbags were originally designed for the average man. Thus, causing a lot of deaths in women and children. I will always be aware of my surroundings as a developer and make sure my work space is comfortable for everybody. 

#### Attention Economy

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/jasonhughes1/402661e446ff851d532e60dea8fc79b5)

I was happy that I chose this session to attend. The session revolved around how companies are doing their best to keep up on their apps/websites as long as possible. There are tricks that they use with coloring and timing to keep you interested and entertained. We talked about ethics and if this is something we could control with our future jobs, would we? 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried my best to meet and get to know both my classmates in mod one, and the greater Turing community. I really enjoyed the pairing sessions with the mod two cohort, as well as seeing all the great things created at the Turing code fair. In the future, I hope to take a more active role in the Turing community in general, not just as a participant.
