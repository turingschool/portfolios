## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to establish a firm foundation in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and build good developer habits by practicing the right way.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

During the last six weeks, I started with a rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS and finished with what feels like a strong foundation 

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/ad-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Starting from scratch felt intimidating but it felt very rewarding to show what I had accomplished in this project to the class. This project taught me how to start from an image and finish with a tangible site as well as the ins and outs of flexbox. It also showed me how much further I need to progress to have a true grasp of HTML and CSS. 

The overall feedback was mostly positive, through there were plenty of small things that needed to be addressed.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/am-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Static Comp Challenge 3 was a beast of a project that I grossly underestimated the man hours it would take to complete. There were many tiny details that took significant understanding to execute properly. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects helped lay a strong foundation in 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/number-guesser/blob/master/README.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Taking an idea and turning it into a real, working thing is a power feeling. Number Guesser was the first time I was able to finish such an intricate project. While the code is nothing to write home about, it's mine, it works, and because of that I love it.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a rewarding challenge for me as it forced a deep understanding of event bubbling and DOM manipulation with JS and jQuery. Working with a pair for the first time also pushed me to better explain my way of thinking and justify my choices to another person while I was working.

#### IdeaBox

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was a great way to learn localStorage and the basics of JSON.

#### 2DoBoxPivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamMescher/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox pushed me as a developer both coding and the soft skills. This project taught me how to look into another codebase and make it my own.

## E: Community Participation

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

The gear up on growth mindset set the tone for my mental state during mod 1. Knowing that many difficult challanges were ahead, the ability to shift into a state of mind that accepts the challange willingly had a strong positive impact.

#### Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

It was fascinating to realize that introversion and extroversion are not binary but rather on a spectrum and how they effect teams. Hearing the personal experiences from those on the opposite side of the spectrum was an illuminating look into how others view the world. Using the knowledge from this session not only helped with my group projects at Turing but also with my roomates.

#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

This session forced a hard look into who I am as a person and what drives me professionally. Talking about it with a partner during the session definately helped me gain a stronger grasp on how to tell my story well. The ability to tell that story doesn't happen overnight, must practice intentionally. 

#### Coding Schools or Coding Fools

* [Imgur URL of whiteboard with talking points](http://imgur.com/a/rjaPf)

This session was an introspection into coding schools, Turing in particular, and whether we're all crazy for coming here or does this teaching model actually have some merits. I found it interesting that we all held a similar perspective, probably because we've all already justified the expense of Turing. The question still looms on my mind but I'm confident that the knowledge gained while at Turing is invaluable and is something employers will desire for years to come.
