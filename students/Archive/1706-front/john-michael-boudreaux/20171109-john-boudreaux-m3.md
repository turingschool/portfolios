## Areas of Emphasis

I just tried to learn as much as possible. I put in a ton of really long hours to get throught this mod. The concepts were pretty abstract and deeper than mod 1, but I thought that they were much cooler to learn about.

This was soo cool. I really enjoyed this project. getting the data was a learning experience and seeing all of the new movies coming out dancing across the screen was pretty cool

## D: Professional Skills
The focus on the resume and job search is a great thing. I liked hearing tips and ideas of what to do. I cant wait to get out and start exploring


### Gear Up

#### Micro Aggressions

I had never heard of these before and sice then have really noticed them happening and also have heard others out in the job force talking about them. It really is a shame the way people pull these off and really dont even notice it. Kinda sad


#### Learning a new language

This one was really cool. It was cool to see two languages next to each other doing the same thing fundamentally. It mad eme not so scared of maybegetting a job in a language other than JS.


#### Tragedy of the Commons

It was crazy to see how when someone is more into having their own types around them segregation is un-avoidable. It shows that we have to think outside of ourselves or we create a not so great environment. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended a code demo night and almost all of the events put together by 1706-fe. There are way to many events to attend them all, but I get to the ones that I can to show some support. I also participate in iron fe and offered all o the help that I could to the mod 2 students.
