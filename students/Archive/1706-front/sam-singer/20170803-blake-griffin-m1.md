# Samuel Singer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Where I starteI set out to learn a variety of things, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I feel like I have a much better understanding of all those, which is a great feeling considering the first 4 weeks was treacherous. I also learned a new level of learning capacity that I didn't know I was capable of especially with the lack of sleep. I feel like I have developed a growth mindset and realized how much I can accomplish if I'm willing to fail and be okay with that at the start.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass, hopefully!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects we were assigned increased our knowledge and understanding of various tools within HTML and CSS. Being able to exhibit control over different elements is essential to understanding how the layout is manipulated depending on the platform it's being shown on.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/number_guesser/guesser2.html)

For this individual project, I was asked to create a functional random number generator and guesser. The user would be able to guess a number from 1-100 and then had the opportunity to increase that value to whatever they wanted set. If the user guessed the number incorrectly a line of text would appear incorrect and would ask the user to attempt another guess. Functionality included a save, clear, reset, and submit button.

Evaluation Comments: 
Keep practicing!

  - Surprise & Delight: Hot Fire

#### Static Comp Challenge:1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/sys-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/ss-comp-challenge-1/index.html)

This involved having us individually utilize flexbox and prepareed us for on screen responsiveness. Being able to compensate with media query breaks and have elements in our page (although static) move depending on the screen size.

There were subtle difficulties with this project that I found challenging and that were addressed with the class evaluation. The size of my layout was fixed so on much larger platforms this did not accomdate the large white space on either side. Also, my choice of colors needs to improve when choosing. Incorporating the image with the color scheme is essential to drawing the viewer in. Work on creating actionable icons that include hover states as well.

Overall: Proficient

#### Static Comp Challenge:2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/sys-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/sys-comp-challenge-2/index.html)

This static comp involved an increased level of difficulty by adding more elements to the mix by having us incorporate cards that would move poistions depending on the screen size. 

The challenges I had for this project was creating a pleasing color scheme and having a strong enough contrast between words and photos.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/sys-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/sys-static-comp-challenge-3/index.html)

This static comp was by far the most complex. It involved a lot of time iterating over concepts of creating colors, buttons, various containers within containers. It took many hours!

What I found challenging with this assignment was making it less busy. I also need to incorporate better judgement when selecting color schemes and various cursor pointers. 
  
## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During out time through this 6 week gauntlet we were required to create three group projects. The first two involved working with one other individual while the last one involved working with two. The first project gave us a functional baseline working with jQuery and Javascript while the next two were understanding those concepts and solidifying them further.

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://cache123.github.io/linked_list/)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/linked_list/index.html)

For this paired project, Ben & I were asked to create a bookmark website, whereby the user could create bookmark cards, edit them, and then display how many bookmarks were created & which were read/unread. The user was able to create a title and website link with editable functionality.

Evaluation Comments:
There was functionality missing that we could have the option of adding, but otherwise notes were not given.

  - Comp Recreation/Design: Advanced Beginner
  - HTML: Proficient

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/ideabox/index.html)

This paired project had Luke and I develop our understanding of localStorage. Pushing information into localStorage and pulling it out on page refresh. There were the typical input fields with an editable Title & Body field along with deleting card functionality and an upvote/downvote button.

Evaluation Comments:
There was no search functionality and the data for the upvote/downvote did not persist along with the deleted. We made effective use of waffle and GitHub as well

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/2DoBox-Pivot/settings)
* [Original Assignment](file:///Users/bounce/Turing/mod1/2DoBox/2dobox-pivot-3/index.html)

This project involved working with two other individuals. We were asked to refactor an existing project from previous classmates and add functinality where it was missing, include some more localStorage abilities, and create some aesthetic touch-ups where necessary. 

Evaluation Comments:
Comments were given in person, and just reiterated some functional points that we should go over.

## D: Professional Skills

Our professional skills development sessions focus on creating a well-rounded individual by creating awareness for your peers and colleagues. I found these very helpfu with my development here at Turing and motivated me to incorporate various tactics and techniques when working with others.  

### Gear Up

#### Action Plan, Working Styles, Inclusivity

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/Cache123/ff6515a000b95ea3c267f6752395dc40)

ActionPlan:
My action plan I created at the beginning helped me hone in to a game plan. I believe I tried to execute that game plan but fell short in a few areas. That's where Ellen Mary stepped into my life and helped me out tremendously. SHe reiterated over some important key points and I followed the instruction this time around to the T. I came away having learned a tremendous amount.

Working Styles:
This gave me a better understanding of introverts and extroverts. I understood how each one gained there energy but didn't understand the benefits of being an introvert. I always felt it was better to be an extrovert but quickly realized how many extroverts were actually introverts and vice-versa. This will allow me to gauge my interactions and work habits better by having a better understanding of individual needs and preferences.

Inclusivity:
Recognizing there is a problem is one thing, taking action is a whole other. We all recognize there is a sex discrepancy in the programmer workplace but very few of us take action to promote this awareness or even implement change for a difference. With my continued involvement about under represented individuals/ minorities I'll strive to create awareness so perhaps others will feel compelled to take action as well!

#### Strengths & Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/Cache123/d317f857f1d8ba8e11d51304fd99c886)

Strenghts & Storytelling:
The main take away here was to feed into your strengths and allow them to flourish and represent who you are as a programmer. Be aware of other individuals strengths as well so that collaboratin can be an effective process for the team. Also be relatable and create a story about who your are so that people can have a better understanding of you as a person.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Giving back to the community felt difficult struggling through mod1. When I did have time to socialize nd reconnect with society I found myself talking about the interesting issues we were talking about in gear-ups. I noticed myself making it clear how large the gender gap ratio was currently and spoke about how it didn't make any sense. This is a language that everyone must understand at a fundamental level ]and be part of. The only other instance I can think of was helping my classmates where I was able to. Those times were limited, because I didn't feel confident with the material myself, so how on earth was I going to explain it to others in a sensible way. Although there was great benefit from both sides when I did so and learned a lot as I hope my classmates did as well.
