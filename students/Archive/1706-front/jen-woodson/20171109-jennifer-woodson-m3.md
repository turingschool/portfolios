## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### eighty-six

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/eighty-six-systems)
* [Original Assignment]()

eighty-six was a self-driven project to create a restaurant POS system using React, Redux, and Router

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

stupid components were pretty stupid. thats pretty neat.

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React but demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.


## Surprise and Delight

4 - Unicorn
3 - Hot Fire
2 - Sparkles
1 - Magic

#### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/SwapiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

Would like visual indication for user on adding and removing favorites
Need individual API calls on specific button clicks to be passing project. -- COMPLETE! Great job making that change

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3.75: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

// want to see redirect working...

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


## D: Professional Skills

Turing profile: https://www.turing.io/alumni/jen-woodson

### Gear Up
#### Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

Gender expectations have become a part of all aspects of our life, and can be toxic. It is up to us to be good human beings and allies.

#### MicroAggressions

It's important to educate ourselves about those who are different from us, so that we can be more understanding. We also need to be allies for each other to create a safe place for all.

#### Parable of the Polygons

Individual biases can affect the group-at-large, and it may not be a positive effect.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was a member of SAB this mod.
