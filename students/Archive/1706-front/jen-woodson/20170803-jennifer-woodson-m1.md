# (Jen Woodson) - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the beginnings of web development this module, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to learn how to use the syntax, libraries, and data structures I had learned in other languages, but for JS.

## Rubric Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel like I did *okay* on the end of module assessment. I would like to discuss this in person. I felt I performed less than I usually do, due to anxiety.

Build an application that stores bookmarks.

- Good work! Really nice execution of the UI, good choices for additional UI elements
- no git or github used, shared code via slack or on a jump drive -- not a sustainable way of working, both really need to quickly gain comfort with git and github and make sure they use it moving forward. It won't get easier until you use it!
- CSS needs some polish, but demonstrates a good attention to detail and a lot of care
- HTML is well thought through
- JS is in a good place for refactoring and could use a clean up pass

Dear Jennifer, It was a great pleasure to work with you. I could have not asked for a better first partner. It was really nice meet outside of school (Starbucks), and have detailed planning of what we wanted to do. I would assume it is rare that two people with such different abilities could come together so easily. We communicated everyday to keep each other up to date. Also, even though I was in charge of CSS, you found the scroll function that push our visual to the next level, I am great full for that. I guess the only downfall to our work flow was that we didn't get to work as much in person, but that is on me too. I recommend to try and do as much as you can in person with your next partner so they can learn all that you offer. Thank you for a great project.

IdeaBox went as smoothly as a project could go. Your knowledge, problem solving, flexibility and communication resulted in a project I'm very proud of and we created without any stress. I feel like it took us a few days to find our stride. The first day working together, I couldn't tell how well we were working together. I'm not sure if this is at all avoidable or just the nature of working with someone new. But we did get to know each other and our work styles quickly. I greatly appreciated you letting me know when you wanted me to slow down or leave something specific for you to work on. Your array solution to the quality status was brilliant and I've borrowed it for to do box. I hope we get paired again in the future.


#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/2DO-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Begin with an IdeaBox code base. Refactor the code, and pivot the project to work with tasks, rather than ideas.
