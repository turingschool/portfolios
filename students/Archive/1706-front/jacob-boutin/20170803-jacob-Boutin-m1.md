(feedback to me)I truly appreciated your gut instincts during the design of our site - specifically implementing a fixed header and hover states for our 'clear read bookmarks' text. Your instincts for design are great, and you shouldn't be doubtful of your abilities. That being said, when you were struggling with difficult concepts I sensed frustration and lack of confidence - which hindered my workflow. I hope in future projects you are able to slow down the workflow when you are struggling with tough concepts. I was blown away by your ability to stick with it, and witnessed your commitment to learning complex concepts through working on mythical creatures and flexbox froggy over the weekend to ensure mastery of those concepts. It was a great pleasure working with you and getting to know you better - looking forward to your feedback for me!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### growth mindset
The growth mindset gear was something i felt i could really relate to. I found that most of the time i had a growth mindset and i still do but its tough to keep it up when you are always stressed about projects and shortcommings. any time i get down on myself someone will say the magic word WHEN

#### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

This gear up helped me to timebox better and to start asking people for help. im pretty worried about bothering people so its a little hard for me to ask for help sometimes. also chunking is a very good way to break things down into manageable parts that arent so scary.

#### Gear Up
#### Working With Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

 This gear up was really eye opening. I think i got some very good pointers on understanding how I work and how to work with others. it did make sense to me though why i feel drained when im around people for too long and i started utilizing my alonetime better.

#### Gear Up
#### Strengths & Storytelling

empathy is something that i struggle with sometimes. i grew up in a tough place we didnt learn things like empathy. Everyone's stories are different, but we are all here now because we wanted a change. we are all here for a common goal

#### Gear Up
#### Debugging The Gender Gap

the gender gap was crazy i wasnt aware of the things they talked about and the things that still go on in the work place. ive always thought that women were smarter than men.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
my takeaways are that this is something i need to be all in with. the growth mindset is something that resonantes with me and i need to keep it in mind. Chunking has helped me so much these past few weeks i was already used to applying it in my old field of work and i am now applying it with coding. i found out im pretty introverted which was wierd for me so getting out of my comfortzone will be something that helps me alot

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

i feel like i really missed out on this. i was always so behind that i felt like i should rather study. i didnt see any of the guest speakers and was pretty withdrawn

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

Will be taking a mod off, auditing particular classes and spending time in the space to leverage student support.
We will put together a plan of attack to ensure progress, has the intent to test into 2

### Outcome

Fail - Taking a mod off with the intent to test into 2
