# Robbie Greiner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to accomplish a lot this module.  My first goal was to establish a solid, healthy, realistic routine.  I set
out to accomplish this mostly with time management.  So far it has gone really well.  I also set out to build a strong
foundation in javascript, HTML and CSS to set me up for a successful mod 2.  I am happy with my progress.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects were completed with an assigned classmate.  Usually projects were assigned on a Friday and 
due the following Thursday.  The majority of my work during these projects was done together directly with 
my partner, but we also utilized working remotely on feature by ourselves.

#### Linked List

Feedback from project partner: 

"Hi Robbie! Being your partner was a great experience. It was really nice working with someone that was just as invested and committed to the outcome. I consistently felt confident in the work that you were doing and I appreciate the time you took to help me understand jQuery and GitHub. Not related to the actual programming itself, you taught me a lot in the evaluation. You showed me how to focus on what we accomplished and all the hard work we put into our project, instead of focusing on things we didn't do or what we could have done better. This is definitely a strength for you and a great balance to my inner perfectionist. In terms of coaching, I think we both took away a lesson about patience in coding. Sitting down and doing more pre-planning together would have probably saved us a lot of time later on. Our impulsive tendencies resulted in some code that was challenging to refactor, but in the end, I think it was a good lesson for us to learn on the first project. While we both may have struggled with patience with the code, you were very patient with me and always took the time to help me understand. You are a very approachable person and enjoyable to be around. I am appreciative of you and grateful for such a positive experience. Thank you for working hard and being an awesome partner!"

A project in which we get assigned another classmate's IdeaBox codebase and we are to pivot the application
and turn it into a to-do list.  This involved heavy refactoring and fixing broken functionality, then pivoting
to a to-do list with features such as upvoting, filtering by importance and hiding read items.

## D: Professional Skills
These are exercises structured to strengthen my professional skills and prepare me for employment. 

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

In this session we watched a documentary called "CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap" and then had group discussions
following.  This documentary was extremlely informative and eye-opening for the current state of females 
in the tech industry.  I was definitely aware of these issues before watching this film, but this film 
shed a greater light on the disparity of men and women in the tech world.  I am much more aware and empathetic 
towards women and the hurdles they face in the tech industry.

#### Coding Schools or Coding Fools

In this session we grouped with other students and discussed the current state of coding schools and how 
they are seen versus traditional education.  This was a great session because it allowed us to discuss
how we see coding schools and how we all come from different educational backgrounds. This is definitely
an interesting topic since very prominet coding schools seem to be closing as of lately.  We talked about
how a coding school's financial model might be best as a non-profit.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module I really put an effort to be involved in the Turing community and embrace the "Turing Way."  I attended
multiple guest speakers on Friday mornings that were extremely helpful and informative for my classmats and I.  
I have done my best to interact with other cohorts by being active in my posse and attending outside social functions.
Another thing I have tried to do is help out classmates that seem to be falling behind.  I have helped multiple classmates
one on one to better understand certian topics.
