 ## D: Professional Skills
 
 ### Gear Up
 #### Empathy and Privelege
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
 
 We talked about privilege and the variances of it in the world.
 We shared stories about our own stories about privilege.
 We talked about how empathy and privilege go together.
 
 #### Group Think
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)
 
 Group think is when people take the mindset of the group.  In my head it can also be called "cult-mentality". I think
 there are many examples of people following the leader and blindly following them.
 
 
 #### Mod 4 Lead- The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F
 
 * [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x36cEw6gUZ8)
 
 The art of not giving a fuck is about determining what you spend your brain power thinking about.  Basically don't
 waste your time stressing and caring about things that don't really matter.
