### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Swapi Box

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiegreiner/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

## PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.

# C: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I haven't experienced too many microagressions while I have been at Turing.  One that does stick out to me
is at a professional development session in which we had to pair with another student and tell our story.
I paired up with one of the back end students.  When he had heard that I was previously an engineer, he told
me that he was suprised that I chose to do front end instead of back end.  I asked him why and he said
because back end is more 'engineering' and logic based.  I kind of interpreted this as him saying that in 
his head front end is more fluffy visual designs, and back end is real engineering and development, which is
absolutely not true.  I politely said that there is plenty of logic in front end. 

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like 
them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?.
  * If only 1/3 of the people in the team are like them, then I think ultimately it will lead to a really diverse team.
  This should mean that 2/3 of the team isn't like them, which means diversity.  So I am not sure if I see a negative
  in this scenario.

Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. 
PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game 
change your assumptions?
  * PotP basically is saying that a big mixture is good. You don't want to bring in just ONE person who is diverse to the group. 
  * I haven't really thought about this.  Bringing in just one person who is diverse might lead to unhappiness of them because there is noone else like them.  PotP says that having many diverse people is good.
  
  
Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
  * Diversifying the group evenly.
  
PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of 
people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. 
Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they 
do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
  * I am not sure I agree with any of this.  If Turing could get 1/3 of a diverse group here that would be an amazing 
  accomplishment.  There are groups that are way underrepresented at Turing and other places. I do not understand
  the issue with 1/3 considering that most teams in America do not contain 1/3 of a diverse group.

PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how 
effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
  * It was definitely more attention grabbing to be able to play a game that visualizes the message, rather than just
  reading a long article with endless text.  I think this is definitely a way to get the attention of more people and 
  educate them on an idea of philosophy that matters to you. 


### Mod 4 Lead - Cold Outreach

This gear up was one of the best things I have been a part of all mod.  It really lit the fire under me to start making
connections and getting to know people.  I have half a dozen coffee dates setup for intermission and have already had
one phone interview as a result of my cold outreach.  I will be using cold outreach extensively until I get a job.

# D: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

I take time to help my classmates and students in lower mods.
