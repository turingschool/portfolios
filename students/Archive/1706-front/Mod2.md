## Jason Hughes
Sorting Suite comments

### Testing
* I'd love to see your tests increment up in complexity
    - Start with an array of 1 number
    - Move to 2 numbers
    - Random array (hundreds)
    - Random array (tens of thousands)
* This will help you see the varying efficiency of each of these sorts

### Bubble
* Good use of ES6
* The `export default` can go right before the function declaration:
    - `export default const bubbleSort = `...
    - instead of using `module.exports`

### Insertion
* See feedback for Bubble

### Merge
* Noooooo where did the ES6 go?
* This is not a requirement, but refactor this into ES6 for your own edification

### Quick
* This is not a requirement, but refactor this into ES6 for your own edification
* The pivot can be `array.pop()`
    - This requires the for loop to specify `i < arr.length`
    - Elminates possibility of comparing it to itself and being trapped in a loop forever
* Remove the `console.log`s and `debugger`s from your production code!

## Score:
Pass

# Instructor: Nathaniel
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

# Comments:

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints
