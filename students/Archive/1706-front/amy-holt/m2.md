# Amy Holt Mod2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod, I was really focused on continuing to build a deep understanding of the concepts we were learning, and being able to explain my code at a high level. I also wanted to improve in refactoring. It's really important to me that I turn in my best work, but I still prioritize learning the concepts over 'finishing' a project. I also wanted to be more confident and feel comfortable speaking up to ask questions and get help.

### Playing a Part

I still love being a part of the community every day! I participated in IronFE sessions at least twice a week, and attended all the Joan Clarke Society meetups that I could. I believe that I was helpful to the Mod 1 students that I spent time pairing with.
