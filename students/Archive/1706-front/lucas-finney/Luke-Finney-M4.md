## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to understand to better understand the architecture underlying the backend and how it works. I found that this module I liked working with backends a lot more than I thought I would. It seems a bit more logcial and straitforward than frontend can be.

## A: Individual Final Assessment

Pass


## B: Required Projects

Module 4 had four required projects: Capstone, House of Vars, Palette Picker and BYOB.

#### Squad Goals - Capstone Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/squad-goals/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Squad Goals is meant to be an application to help groups of friends connect to encourage group completion of various goals. As an example, say you want to get better at running and traing for a marathon with some friends. You and your friends could make a Squad for this purpose and then set a series of goals to complete as you train. This would make you accountable to your friends as you train and help create an environemnt of friendly competition.

For BYOB my partner, Amy Holt, and I built the backend for online teacher forum where teachers could post questions, lesson plans, comments, etc. pertaining to specific Common Core standards for education.

#### Open Food Network - House of Vars

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/house-of-vars.html)

On the House of Vars project, my group and I worked on the Open Food Network's open source project. It was a bit intimidating at first to pull down such a huge code base, but it ended up being a cool experience that is detailed in my blog post above.

#### Palette Picker - Build Your Own Backend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/palette-picker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

Palette Picker might have been one of my favorite projects at Turing. Building the backend was so interesting and it was the first application I've ever launched into the great ether that is the World Wide Web. However, what I most liked about it was that we continued adding features to it after completing the base requirements like adding IndexedDB. This was unique as compared to an other projects at Turing and it was cool to grow this app from scratch and keep adding to it.

### Gear Up - Be Your Own Ally

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_7.md)

The Gear-Up I helped plan and lead focused on building strategies for people to to speak up when it might be challenging or difficult for an array of reasons. The feedback from our participants was overall quite positive. They appreciated the opporuntity to think through situations that they have either been in or will likely be in one day. The participants appreciated our organization, as well.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

- I keep a rolling Google Doc with all the class resources on it that I share with my classmates
- I pair with lower mod students when I can
