2. Code Quality: 3 Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
Product Experience

1. User Experience: 3 The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

(Evaluation Comments)

Product and Feature Delivery
  1. Completion: 2.5 ** talk to josh
  2. Organization: 4
  3. User Experience: 3

Technical Quality
  1. Test-Driven Development: 3+: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
  2. Code Quality: 3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

  Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

(Evaluation Comments)
  - Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status. Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.

  - Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I always try to give and receive feedback to others as much as possible and try to listen to my peers and teachers to improve myself.

### Being a Community Member

"John was a great guy to work with.  At times the group had a little too much stress and John was the balancing factor.  He was always in a positive mood and calm which can be a really big deal when woking in a stressful environment.  His code was solid and I really enjoyed working with him." - Justin Pease

"When I first started working with John, I mistook his care-free nature for a lack of work ethic. ​*I was wrong.*​ When focused, John is a highly capable programmer. He dives in and gets the job done. His knowledge of the original code base and work on the cart/shopping functionality were critical to our success." - Emily Dowdle

"Slota was an awesome teammate to have during this project. He consistently showed a willingness to work hard and get things done, even if it meant losing a little bit of sleep. He was also extremely flexible as far as when he was available to work, which  made it very easy to pair on this project. Overall, he was a great teammate and I look forward to working with him again in the future." - Tyler Komoroske

### Playing a Part

- I helped Travis teach kids how to code at DSST
- Attended 2 DSA classes taught by Horace
- Part of the newly formed Settlers of Catan Club
