# Aaron Careaga - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for the fourth module was to take my JavaScript knowledge to a professional level and finish the program with solid job leads. I also wanted to embrace every day left at Turing and appreciate the experiences we have gone through with plans of giving back in the future (alumni fund).

### Work

I completed two individual projects and two team projects during the fourth module.

#### IdeaBox 2.0

##### Description

IdeaBox 2.0 is the first individual project in Module 4 at the Turing School. The application is built using Rails with jQuery and AJAX to provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface. The project was evaluated by Meeka Gayhart.

## Community

"After my mentor informed me she no longer had the time to mentor, I’ve been leaning on mod 4 for that help and Aaron stepped in to fill some of that space. Routinely, he has, with a smile, withstood my constant badgering of questions when I see him first thing in the morning, later that afternoon or late into the night. He’s helped me on a variety of projects, even when he’s in the midst of his own challenges, and has made not having a mentor doable." - Dan Winter

“I have been able to witness Aaron’s incredible growth as a developer over the last 7 months. The technical skills he has developed are extremely impressive and his soft skills couldn’t be any better, I always look forward to collaborating with him for various reasons. First, he is always willing to try any approach, but doesn’t lose sight of the project goals at any time. Secondly, his personality makes it very enjoyable to solve challenging problems together without getting discouraged. I would highly recommend Aaron to anyone!" - Jason Pilz

"Aaron Careaga is a force to be reckoned with. I’ve spent a lot of my Turing career pair programming with this gentleman and I have learned so much from him. Aaron legitimately is a workhorse. The guy has a switch in his brain that says 110% and that’s the only speed he knows how to go. The guys solves programming problems in his sleep. It’s ridiculous. He always knows where we are in the code and he comes up with brilliant ideas and solutions for problems. As a friend Aaron has always been super generous to me. He’s had me over his house for dinner many times and has been a really good friend. I’m really thankful for how our path’s crossed and the friend I’ve found in this guy. I’m super confident in his ability to program and inspire people to do their best. Turing is so lucky to have this guy and any team would be beyond blessed to have him as a developer. I”m low-key bummed that I won’t be pairing with him as much (we’ve literally done every single project together since pivot) but I am excited to see the cool thing this guys builds. So thankful we’re friends. I’m a big Aaron Careaga fan." - Jhun de Andres

"If I could graph Aaron’s time at Turing, it would be a never ending upwards trend right off the page!  I am convinced that while Aaron remains quiet and reserved, he is secretly plotting to take over Turing and inevitably, the tech world as a whole.  In all seriousness, Aaron’s strength is his ability to remain calm and collected while the whole basement goes into meltdown mode.  His curiosity to learn new languages and frameworks astounds and inspires me to do the same.  I am proud to call Aaron not only an incredible classmate, but also an out of this world friend.  I can’t wait to see where he ends up and I hope one day to come back together as bad ass senior dev’s to tackle a project on our own." - Jill Donohue

"In my opinion, Aaron is one of the top all-around developers from our cohort.  He’s incredibly thoughtful with his code and the people he work’s with. He always thoroughly understands the code he writes and can very effectively communicate how it works. I hope, post-Turing, we can still find a way to work together and continue to learn from each other." - Matt Rooney

"Aaron, great work this module! You and Jhun were such a good, positive team on game time and scale up. No matter how many bugs came up, I never saw either of you look frustrated. You’re a calm, very smart and hard working guy - which is exactly what the notes on your first interview say and what I’ll say on your last portfolio review. Those personality types lead to a lot of success as a developer, and I’m excited to see where your passion for finance, sense of humor in the face of bizarre errors messages, drive to complete every assignment on time and well and good nature takes you in the next few years." - Romeeka Gayhart
