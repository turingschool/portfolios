## Team

### Projects

I completed three team projects during the second module, Traffic Spy, Rails Mini Project, and Little Shop of Orders.

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/patwey/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

We built a web traffic tracking and analysis tool using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord. The project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

"One issue with sending payloads at first. Problem solved id should be identifier. Views are clean and contain no logic. Server(controller) is really clean. Great use of poros. Error page can be more specific to the issue."

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

Tyler Komoroske: "It was awesome to work with you on this project. You seem to have a knack for the front-end stuff which is really cool. I learned a lot from pairing with you and you did a great job of communicating throughout the project. You have some really good ideas when it comes to these projects, so don't be afraid to express your views and ideas moving forward. Awesome job, man!"

Pat Wey: "Working with Aaron on traffic spy was a pleasure.  He brought a calming presence to our pairing sessions, and has a solid understanding of the structure of web apps.  Most impressively, he had the initiative to do all of the styling for our project.  It looked really impressive, and was one of my favorite parts of the project.  I look forward to working with him again."

#### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/point-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

A travel rewards site built with Rails and Materialize. This project was not evaluated.

Shannon Paige: "I had never partnered with Aaron before our Rails mini-project and I’m really mad about it, because he was so awesome to work with. He was a great pairing partner and brought so much good energy and good ideas to the table. When I started to go down rabbit holes, he always brought me back. His understanding of Rails was so impressive it encouraged me to study harder to catch up to him. I would definitely work with Aaron again on any project."

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/global-pursuit)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

We built a travel package site shaped around hobbies such as hiking, skiing, or photography. Tools included Rails, Postgres, Materialize, and ActiveRecord. Our project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

"I'm leaning towards a 4 (on testing), but missed some small basic feature coverage."

* Feature Completeness: 3
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 4
* Models: 4
* Testing: 3.5
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 3

Torie Joy Warren: "Your organizational skills and calmness make working with you really easy. I also really enjoyed your drive to figure things out. You've got a lot of great ideas and I would definitely enjoy working with you again."

Nicole Hall: "Working with you has been a delight and a really good learning experience for me.  You are endlessly patient.  When you’re clobbered by errors, you patiently trouble shoot each one, methodically moving the pry down each line of code.  You pry and experiment and tweek until the test passes.  Speaking of tests, I love that you actually use the TDD approach.  With past groups I have suggested using test to drive development and have been surprised to learn that some our peers prefer to write tests after the fact.  You are encouraging when I feel like I have no clue what is going on.  You are persistent until you find the answer.  I was really impressed with your JQuery skills.  Especially because you had less than a day of experience using JQuery and Javascript.  You also really impressed me by picking up HAML so quickly.  Keep it up!  Any company would be lucky to have you as a dev on their team."

## Community

I provided feedback to Pat Wey, Tyler Komoroske, Shannon Paige, Torie Joy Warren, and Cole Hall during the second module.
