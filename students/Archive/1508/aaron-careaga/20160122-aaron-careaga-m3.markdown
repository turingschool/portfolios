# Aaron Careaga - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My goal for the third module was to take my Ruby and Rails knowledge to a professional level and become comfortable working with API's and JavaScript. I also wanted to continue my weekly meetings with Lovelace mentor Elliot Winkler.

### Attendance

I attended all class on time during the third module.

### Work

I completed two individual projects and two team projects during the third module.

#### API Curious

* [Heroku](https://adventurejournal.herokuapp.com/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/adventure-journal)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#available-apis)

API Curious is the first individual project of module three at Turing. Adventure Journal is photo journal site built using the Instagram API. The project was evaluated by Josh Mejia.

##### Evaluation Comments

Solid project and nicely organized. Could have converted hashes to objects for data being returned from Instagram.

##### Scores

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 4

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Rails Engine is the second individual project in module three at Turing. It's a Rails application that uses ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. The project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

##### Evaluation Comments

Reached for ruby within a handful of quieries. No model level tests, but controller tests had moderate to good robustness. Some strategy changes were suggested within testing. Some refactoring of queries would have been good.

##### Scores

* Completion: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3.5
* Code Quality: 3
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3

## Team

### Projects

I completed one group project and one pair project during the third module, The Pivot and Trelora Leaderboard.

#### The Pivot

* [Heroku](https://ticketly.herokuapp.com/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/ticketly)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot is the first project in module three at Turing. Each group is given a legacy project to work with. We started with a site called Global Pursuit, a tourism/hosting platform. Our group included Robbie Lane, Jhun de Andres, Adam Jensen, and myself. The project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer and Josh Mejia.

##### Evaluation Comments

  Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status. Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.

  * Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  * Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  * Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.

##### Scores

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3+

Adam Jensen: "Aaron is super calm and really great to pair with. I think Aaron brings out a really good balance of speculation and encouragement during pairing. The reason why I mention this is because this balance really make pairing with Aaron productive. Usually when someone is off balanced, it can be harder to accomplish things. But Aaron can provide feedback without being overbearing and rude. Its Super effective."

Robbie Lane: "It was a pleasure to work with Aaron on the pivot. He is a very talented and motivated developer. He constantly surprised me with his knowledge and drive. He was a crucial member of this project, and I look forward to collaborating in the future."

#### Trelora Leaderboard

* [Heroku](https://ratinganimals.herokuapp.com/)
* [BitBucket URL](https://bitbucket.org/ratingsa/ratinganimals)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

The Trelora Leaderboard is a web application dashboard built for [Trelora](http://www.trelora.com/), a  full service commission-free real estate company located in Denver, CO. The goal of the project was to build an internal dashboard that displays transaction data, customer feedback, and agent rankings on TV screens throughout their office. I partnered with Jhun de Andres and we implemented the project using Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. The project was evaluated by Josh Mejia.

##### Evaluation Comments

Mostly JS and very little Ruby. Pushed boundries on what was taught in class. All data on the page is loading using AJAX.

##### Scores

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 4
* Performance: 2

Jhun de Andres: "Aaron is not only an amazing programmer and  a really great friend. His knowledge and ability to logically think through problems makes me program better. I admire his ability to process problems and break them apart. In the times that we’ve paired I’ve hoped that quality would rub off on me. He’s super organized and knows how to set clear expectations. I know that if I am paired with Aaron not only am I going to get my work done but the whole time we’re going to be swinging for the fences. I will never turn down an opportunity to program with this guy and anyone who does will get the assurance that your task will be done and done. Thanks Aaron for being a solid partner in the Pivot and this personal project. You’ve been an amazing friend!"

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided feedback to Adam Jensen, Robbie Lane, and Jhun de Andres during the third module.

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

* Paired with 1510 students Jordan Lawler and Dan Winter multiple times throughtout the module.
* Skied with fellow students and instructors (organized through the Turing Skis channel) many weekends of the module.
