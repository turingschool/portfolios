# Robbie Lane - M4 Portfolio

### Your Mission

My mission for module 4 was to become a more well rounded developer. I think I have accomplished this and I feel confident with my javascript skills. Learning a second language has reinforced the idea that programming is less about what language you use and more about thinking like a developer. That being said, after spending the last six weeks learning javascript, I have really grown to appreciate the language. After all it is the language of the web, and we are here to be web developers.

I feel fortunate to have been offered a job at the beginning of this module, which afforded me the luxury to really focus on the material free from distractions. That being said, there were definitely things this module that I may have not taken as seriously had I not had a job lined up. However, I chose to stay and complete Turing because I wanted to become a more complete developer and I think I accomplished this.

### Attendance

I have been present for nearly every day, with the exception of when my children were too sick to attend daycare.

### Projects

#### Game Time

_Partner: Ross Edfort_

Game Time was by far one of the most fun projects I completed while at Turing. Me and Ross had the idea of doing a side scrolling game and we settled on flappy-bird because it is a relatively simple game with few moving parts. We decided to take advantage of ES6 and it's 'classes', which felt intuitive coming from Ruby. The most challenging part of this project was getting the physics on par with the real flappy-bird. I think we accomplished this and the game feels very similar to the original. In addition, we continued the tradition of putting Turing instructors into game time projects with the famed 'Jorge Mode'.

#### Real Time

This was another project that I really enjoyed. I decided to use react.js for this partly because it's what my employer uses and mainly because it's a framework that has really interested me. I like that react is a very lightweight and powerful framework. After writing ideabox and thoughtbox using just jquery and not feeling great about the quality of my code, it was a pleasure using react to write code that felt natural and intuitive. React components make code DRY and writing HTML directly into JSX files seems like a smart way to keep code organized and easy to follow. Also, web-sockets are awesome!

#### Bartleby (Scale Up)

_Partner: Ross Edfort_

Bartleby was a fun project because we got to learn a couple new technologies that are both exciting on their own, but combining them to create a full featured desktop application was really cool. In addition, we all got to contribute to an open source project that was essential to creating this application. Electron is super cool and I look forward to creating more Electron apps in the future.

The biggest hurdle for this project an was extension that allows markdown notes to be uploaded to github gists. We struggled with getting Githubs OAuth working and at the time of the evaluation we had to settle with only being able to upload anonymous gists. However, since the evaluation I have been able to get this feature working and I have been using this application as well as continuing development with more features.

## Community

### Being a Community Member

I pride myself on always taking time to help others even if I am busy with my own project. I feel that especially in this module, people felt comfortable coming to me with questions or even just asking for advice. Furthermore, really enjoy pairing with my fellow students, which I am not sure I could have said at the start of Turing.


### Feedback:

*"Robbie is one of the most talented and driven individuals I've met at Turing. Working with Robbie will always result in a finished product that is not only clean and polished on the front-end, but logically sound and well factored on the back-end. Robbie has the ability to tackle unique and complicated problems with ease. I'm thankful to have worked with Robbie as many times as I have, and look forward to continuing our friendship and collaboration after Turing."* - Ross Edfort

*"Robbie, Robbie, Robbieâ€¦. where to begin?  First things first, a huge shoutout to the only student to ever go from foxtrot to echo in Module 1!  That in itself is an amazing feat.  However, Robbie has done far more impressive things including, but  not limited to, having an amazing laugh, still showing up to module 4 despite having a job, and always helping ANYONE no matter what.  It would be one thing if he kept this cornucopia of knowledge to himself, but Robbie proves time and time again that patience is equally as important as brain power. I said it at TRELORA, and I will say it again, Robbie is the most talented student in our cohort and deserves a job more than anyone else.  Cheers Robbie and remember to try to give everyone else a chance once in a while!"* - Jill Donohue

*"I don't think I've ever met someone as gifted at programming as Robbie Lane. He's like the Yoda of 1508. He's a legend and he's going to create and build so many amazing things. Guy's like him are phenoms! Despite all the pressure and all the requirements this school presses on it's students he's been able to exceed those expectations and be a father to his kids.
One of my favorite projects at Turing was The Pivot. Robbie was given the title of lead in our group and I felt super confident. I felt like I was free to do what I wanted creatively but I also felt like he trusted me as a developer. It was a cool experience because it made me want to worker harder. I feel like Robbie does this on any team he's own. He's got the technical gusto but he's also has the leadership characteristics to help get the best out of his team. I'm super thankful our path's crossed like they did in the Turing basement. I'm super excited that he'll be staying in Denver which will allow our friendship to continue."* - Jhun
