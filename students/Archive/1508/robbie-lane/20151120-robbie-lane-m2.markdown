## Individual

### Your Mission

During my second module here at Turing, I have made strides in both my programming skills as well as my collaborative skills.
I thoroughly enjoyed working in groups for the majority of projects this module. One goal of mine this module was to improve
my communication and I feel I did that with each of our projects. I excel at adapting to the different work styles of different
people, and enjoyed solving problems as a group. Although the curriculum this module was a lot of information, I was able to put
the extra time and effort, and I feel like I have a solid understanding of it.

### Attendance

During this module I have had perfect attendance and have never been tardy.  

### Work

Even though there was no evaluated individual work this module, I enjoyed many of the homework tutorials and put in a lot of
effort to get the most out of them. I spent time learning html frameworks and doing the extensions.

## Team

### Projects

As emphasized previously, I feel I most improved as a collaborator. I have improved with explaining my reasoning and feel I have significantly contributed to each group project as well as learned a lot from my peers.

## Community

### Being a Community Member

Feedback:

*"Robbie was an awesome teammate. He is extremely talented in all aspects of website development. Our project workflow was awesome, and there was essentially no stress throughout the entire project. Robbie constantly had solutions to almost every problem we ran into. The only area for improvement would be group communication. Sometimes I would mention a possible idea or solution, and I wouldn't get any feedback and that kind of made me feel like what I had suggested was stupid. I'm pretty sure that this was actually just a product of Robbie being really focused on whatever he had going on in his own head. I'm sure he was not just intentionally ignoring me, just something to be aware of in the future. Overall, Robbie was a great teammate and I would love to have an opportunity to work with him in the future."*

*"Robbie is an excellent team member because he is efficient, motivated, and incredibly easy  to work with. When he took on pieces of functionality on his own, he always came back with something that was not only finished, but exceeded my expectations. His relaxed, yet efficient work style is something I admire. I donâ€™t have anything that I would recommend for Robbie to improve upon. I would absolutely work with Robbie again in the future."*


### Playing a Part

This module I made an asserted effort to help out my peers more. I was always willing to put my own work aside and help someone else with a problem. In addition to that, one of my biggest contributions to the community this module was continuously keeping the coffee pot full.
