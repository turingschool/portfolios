# Robbie Lane - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

For module 3 my mission was to become a more well rounded developer. I strengthened my Rails knowledge and feel I have a strong understanding of web technologies and methodologies. I have also pushed myself to become more comfortable with javascript and feel like I have a solid start for module 4.

### Attendance

During this module I have have been present everyday.

### Feedback:

*"I had a great time partnering with you on the Pivot. Your understanding of complex topics, ability to deliver features that go above expectations, and overcome the hurdles we faced throughout our project was excellent. I look forward to seeing where you go in your development career. Hope to work together again in the future."*

*"I don't know how Robbie does it but he does. He can juggle having a family and slaying it at school. He constantly knows where he’s at in the code and It’s something I admire. Every time I’ve paired with Robbie has been a stellar experience. I always learn something really cool. What blows me aways is that He is full of knowledge and he is super willing to share that knowledge with the people around him. People like that are people you want to surround yourself with. Thanks Robbie!"*

*"I’d bet a lot of money that Robbie Lane is the best developer to finish module 3 that Turing has ever had. Robbie, if you are reading this, don’t let that get to your head. You still suck. Anyways…its been a tremendous pleasure working with Robbie. His calm demeanor and humility truly set him apart from many other people and not just as a developer, but as a person. I’d say I've “leveled up” simply because we got a chance to work together and pair the majority of the time. I’d work with Robbie again on any project in the future."*


### Playing a Part

A goal for this module was to try and help others more. I feel I accomplished this and put a concerted effort to pair program more often. I paired with other students from not only my module but helped many of the mod 1 and 2 students with their projects. This has helped reinforce ideas and concepts in my own mind and hopefully in theirs too. I also am fairly diligent with keeping a full pot of coffee. :)
