# Matt Stjernholm - M2 Portfolio

### Your Mission

My main goal for this module was to find more effective ways of studying/coding. I wanted to promote a better balance between being a part of the Turing community and having more non-coding time, while still maintaining a high academic standard for myself.

### Attendance

I was present everyday this module.

Completed the spicy (difficult) version for this intro to CRUD project.  

#### Contact Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/contact_manager)  

Finished all base functionality + added some front end fuctionality.

## Team

### Group Projects

#### Traffic Spy

In this project, I felt like Ryan and I worked really well together to build a Sinatra app that we were both proud of.

Teammate: Ryan Johnson  

Comments:

* Overall good work. Server(controller) could be a little skinnier but made good use of POROs. Testing was good too, make sure to test all AR models for validations. Continue to TDD. Be careful of naming variables. Be a little more robust with feature tests - click through some functionality. Great use of scoping feature tests.

Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

Matt Rooney, Edgar Duran, and I made an e-commerce site for snowboarding gear.  We were really happy with both the functionality and the front-end that we ended up with.

Comments:
* "Sharp product. all features implemented correctly, added mailer and fuzzy search for extensions. good test coverage -- would like to see less repetition in test data preparation."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* For Matt Rooney -   
*Had a great time working with Matt.  He always completed his share of the work and really did a great job of diving into uncharted waters to figure out how to complete new features.  Looking forward to working with him again in the future.*  

* For Edgar Duran -   
*Edgar did a great job completing the tasks that he took on and was really proactive on getting help when needed. It was impressive to see him take a task home for the evening and always come back with great code the following morning.*

* For Ryan Johnson -   
*Ryan was a great parter to have on my first project of module 2.  We had very similar working styles and he always brought a critical eye to the code we were writing.  I'm impressed by his knack to grasp new concepts and implement them quickly. Looking forward to working with him again.*

### Being a Community Member

* *"I feel like I learned a lot about front-end design from you on this project and felt that we communicated well and pushed each other to always do a little better. I hope we get the chance to work together again."*  
-- Matt Rooney (Little Shop)  

* *"Matt was an amazing partner. His  ability to solve problems to got us out of difficult situations never failed to impress me. He is easy to communicate with and always willing to help when one of his team members is stuck. Having such a knowledgable partner really made this project enjoyable."*  
--Edgar Duran (Little Shop)

* *I really enjoyed working with Matt. He is a very skilled developer and I was able to learn a lot from him. His focus and work ethic really motivated me to do my best work. I would definitely want to work with him on any other project in the future.*  
--Ryan Johnson (Traffic Spy)


### Playing a Part  

Jeff asked me to work on being a better Turing community member in module 2, and I think I've done a good job of that.  During Mod 2, I took on things like:

* Organizing a ski film outing to the Mayan theater with ~10 Turing students (Keep Jumbo wild).

* Planning lunches and the park with frisbee and members from multiple cohorts.

* Planning frisbee golf outings with Ross.

* Introducing Turing students to my existing community in Denver.

* Going rock climbing with Turing Students.

* Getting to know 1510'ers both in and away from Turing. From hanging out with them on weekends to helping them on their projects, I've really enjoyed getting to know them.

* Looking ahead: I'm planing to continue the trend of getting to know Turing folks better and I'm going to organize ski trips for students who have the Rocky Mountain Super Pass.

## Review

### Notes

* tried to focus on taking some time away from code and it helped him be more productive. 
* Try to kick up the level a bit. Go above and beyong and bring your peers along with you. 
* Getting good at pairing has been the biggest challenge. 
* Solid community building 
* Bring others into your further explorations 
* Get a mentor!

### Outcome

Pass
