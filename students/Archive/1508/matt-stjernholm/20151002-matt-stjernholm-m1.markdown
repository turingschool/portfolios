### Your Mission

While I checked the bucket that I had 50-1000 hours of programming experience coming into turing, I still felt like the projects in Echo were always just a bit beyond my reach.  After struggling through Echo the first couple of weeks, I set my sights on completing module 1 without having to drop down to Foxtrot.  Despite banging my head into the keyboard for countless hours on these projects (and consistently feeling behind), I was satisfied with not only grinding it out through Echo, but for being proud of the work that I submitted. Looking ahead, I'm hoping the extra effort in Module 1 will translate to putting me one step closer to my goal for post-Turing life of being able to build anything that I can dream up.

### Attendance

Missed 1/2 day on afternoon of Friday, 9/4 for a wedding, but other than that I've been present and on time for every class.

### Work

Below are the individual projects that I completed.  I'm proud to be able to say that the hard work paid off and I didn't receive any 1's or 2's throughout module 1.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

The sorting-suite was a fun, but difficult first project for Echo. However, I do think it really helped to galvanize the Echo group early on.  Most of the class came in on Saturday to meet with Josh and figure out what we were doing, and that seemed to set the pace for the rest of the module.

* [OriginalAssignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)


Was really tough to grasp at first, but as soon as I stopped trying to understand the ins-and-outs of linked lists/started writing code, it became much easier.  Great intro to data structures.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Really proud with the progress that I was able to make on this project, because I as away at a wedding the entire weekend. Ended up writing a ton of code to make it all work, but feel like it came together really well for the amount of time I had.

Assessed By: Josh

Comments:
* *Tests all pass*  
* *Pretty good test names, could be a tad bit more descriptive*  
* *Use abstractions in test, too*
* *When your class uses all the shit of another class like node (this is commonly called "feature envy") that is an indicator that the functionality you are using belongs to the thing with all the attributes that you're working with.*


Scores:  

* Overall: 3  
* Functional Expectations: 3  
* TDD: 4  
* Encapsulation: 3

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thew88/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

One of the more frustrating projects for me -- made a ton of progress early on, but stalled out after a couple days because some of my File I/O "wiring" was wrong.

Assessed By: Jeff   

Comments:

* *Like seeing 20 tests off the bat*
* *Try to use fewer instance variables*
* *Like the method decomposition, but take it one step further*
* *Like that you were able to brute force the read tests when struggling*
* *Continue refining your testing techniques at multiple levels*

Scores:  
* Overall: 3  
* TDD: 3
* Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 3

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Headcount was a beast.  Although it stretched to my limits, I'm happy and proud to be finished with it :)

### Giving Feedback

* For Ross Edfort -   
*"Ross was a great partner to pair with, and a lot of the success that we had on the project was likely due to our ability to work well together.  We both have similar work styles and we're on the same page with how much time and effort we intended to put in to headcount.  There were a lot of long stretches where we sat in front of the computer, stumped on a problem for hours, and relied on each other to keep putting one foot in front of the other.  After week of countless hours, expletive-filled-rants, and high fives, we learned a ton more about programming and also built rapport with one another that we likely would not have found otherwise.  Overall: great first experience for a pairing project!"*

* For Jason Pilz -   
*"Jason consistently pushed me to be a better student throughout Module 1.  His positive outlook and “you can do it” attitude is a big reason why I stuck around in the Echo group — which I’m extremely grateful for.  On top of that, Jason showed me countless keybinding shortcuts, Atom add-ons, and tricks that streamlined my workflow and made me more efficient.  Can’t imagine where I’d be without Jason, and I look forward to having him around next module!"*

* For Torie Joy-Warren -   
*“Torie has been a great classmate and teammate for the entirety of our first module.  She was always willing to lend  helping hand when I had questions on things that she’d already figured out, and she was always patient and thorough with her explanations.  I was lucky enough to have Torie as a partner for multiple pairing exercises and one team project.  Her positive attitude and kind demeanor were always fun to be around, and I learned a great deal from her each time we’ve paired.  I’ve seen her act in this capacity, not only for me, but for many others in 1508 -- we’re lucky to have her."*

### Being a Community Member

*  *"Matt was an incredibly easy person to get along with and work with. When we divided responsibilities Matt always came back with his share completed. When we paired he was constantly contributing to the task at hand and had useful insights. His knowledge and work ethic were extremely admirable. Overall, I would be thrilled to work with Matt on a future project.*    
-- Ross Edfort (Headcount Partner)

* *"Working with Matt during this module has been a pleasure. His motivation and dedication inspires me to continue to push when feeling tired or discouraged. I have improved my programming and pairing skills this module with Matt’s help. I have observed Matt being willing and excited to help all cohort-mates whenever he is given the opportunity."*     
-- Jason Pilz (The *original* O.G.)

* *"Matt was great to work with, because he was a rare mix of very relaxed while
still caring a lot about the project. He didn't seem afraid to share ideas at all but also always listened to and (more importantly) considered any ideas I had, which made for a great working relationship. He's also just generally pleasant to be around - which has been much appreciated throughout the entire module."*  
-- Torie Joy-Warren

### Playing a Part  

* Through Module 1, I've tried to help others anywhere that I could.  From removing roadblocks and helping them move past pieces that stumped me, to lending a hand on new projects that I haven't seen before. I've been on the receiving end of lots of great help during my first six weeks, and it's nice to be able to reciprocate that as well.

* It also felt good to write additional tests for the Headcount Spec Harness when the class needed them to finish the project.  Ross and I spent a few hours on the night before headcount was due to help people troubleshoot issues they were having with out tests.

* Outside of coding-related-things I try my best to be a kind, decent human-being to everybody here. As for cleaning -- when I'm here late -- I help out with putting dishes away at the end of the day (and I've finally learned how to not get drenched when taking the plastic cups out of the dishwasher).

### Notes

* You can do a little bit more to be a person that people can't overlook. 
* Find a thing that's going to be your thing that you invite people to.
