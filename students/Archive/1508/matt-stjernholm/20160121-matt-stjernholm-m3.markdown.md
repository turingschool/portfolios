# Matt Stjernholm - M3 Portfolio

### Your Mission

My main goal for this module was to gain the knowledge/confidence to feel like an actual developer.  I still have a ways to go and a few things to revisit from module 3, but I'm happy with where I'm at and with the apps that I've been able to build. 

### Attendance

In this module, I missed one Friday and was tardy two days.

### Work

Below are the projects that I completed for module 3.

## Individual

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/api-twitter-curious)
* [Production App](https://twitter-curious.herokuapp.com/)

  Built a Twitter look-a-like app using Omni-auth, Bootstrap, and the Twitter API.

  Scores:

  Instructor: Josh
    * Completion: 3+
    * Test-driven-development: 4
    * Code-quality: 3+
    * Organization: 4
    * UX: 4


  Notes:

  Unfollow user extension and added unfavorite tweet. Really solid project. One improvement would be to use POROs to wrap the objects returned from Twitter.


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/rales_engine)

  Built Rails Engine with RESTful routes and most queries were made with Active Record.

  Scores:

  Instructor: Tess

  * [Heroku](https://snow-a1ert.herokuapp.com)
  * [Digital Ocean](http://104.236.171.87)

  Built an app where users can select their favorite ski resorts to get email updates on when they can
  expect to have a powder day.  Hit Forecast.io and Google maps API's, learned Semantic UI front-end for
  this project, and used caching to increase performance.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* For Shannon Paige -   
*I really enjoyed working with Shannon on the Pivot and also collaborating with her on Rails Engine. She brings a great problem-solving ability to any coding challenge and I'm grateful for everything that I learned from her in Module 3.*  

* For Mike Wong -   
*Mike was very helpful both as a teammate on the Pivot and also as a resource for advice throughout Module 3. He's always looking to lend a hand and did a great job helping out with his prior knowledge of the curriculum*

* For Cole Hall -   
*Happy to have had the chance to work with Cole on the Pivot.  At the beginning of the project we had the chance to pair a couple times, and I felt like it was easy for us to stay on the same page.*

### Being a Community Member

* Organizing ski days with Turing folks.

* Spending time hanging out with and getting to know students from 1510 and 1511.

* Helping 1508'ers on their personal projects.

* Rock Climbing at Denver Bouldering Club and Movement with Turing students from all cohorts.


*I likely would not have put together a test suite on my personal project without Matt's help. Matt saw me working feverishly on the night before it was due, and sat down for an hour working through a tough issue with OAuth testing. While we didn't figure out the issue then, Matt went home and continued researching the issue and slacked me a snippet that I adjusted and worked. Thanks to Matt I was able to build out a full test suite and finish a successful personal project. He really went above and beyond to help me during a particularly stressful time.*

*Working with Matt was great as he has a real knack for design and user interactability that is subtle, but oh so crucial. Once Matt was able to lay his hands on its design, our project rapidly went from something I was ‘meh’ about working on, to something that piqued my interest with every page load. An eye for detail is crucial in this industry and this guy has got it!*

--Mike Wong

### Playing a Part  

At my last portfolio review, Rachel asked me to "Try to kick up the level a bit. Go above and beyond and bring your peers along with you."  I feel like I could've done a better job of that in Module 3, but will look to put in more during the next module. However, I am happy with the life-balance that I was able to achieve throughout our heavy workload.
