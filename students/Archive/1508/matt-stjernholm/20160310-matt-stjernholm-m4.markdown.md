# Matt Stjernholm - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 4, I wanted to learn enough Javascript to graduate with the confidence to work on professional, production Rails/Node apps and I wanted to become comfortable with learning new programming languages. I feel fortunate for learning my second programming language while still at Turing.  From here on out, learning a third or fourth language seems less duanting and I look forward to picking up another.  In total, I've gotten more out of each of my four Modules at Turing than I had ever hoped for, and I feel beyond prepared to enter the workforce as a professional developer.

### End of Module Assessment

- Passed module 4 without needing to take the final assessment.

### Work

While I loved the projects in module 3, I think I enjoyed -- and am more proud of -- the apps that we were able to build in module 4.
It was amazing to see how quickly you can pick up a new language once you already know one, and I was shoked at the interesting things you can do with just a little JavaScript under your belt.

Description: One-day assessment for building a note-taking app.

Feedback: Extremely friendly interface! Nice use of Angular and impressive pivoting to not going down an insane Angular rabbit-hole and getting the filter feature done with jQuery.

Tips - Maybe split up the larger integration test when it fails to isolate which part is failing.

## Team

### Projects

Had a great time with my partners (Matt Rooney & Emily Dowdle) for the two team Game Time projects.  Felt like we worked well together and were able to make our own unique contributions to the projects.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Matt Rooney: I really enjoyed my time working with Matt in module 2 on Little Shop, and was grateful for another chance to team up with him during the Bartleby project in module 4.  He’s consistently been one of the most enjoyable people to pair with at Turing -- as he’s both a very strong coder and a fun person to be around.  He brings a relaxed, yet focused feel to any team environment and makes great contributions towards moving difficult projects forward.  He’s been a great partner in crime for projects and student led-sessions, and I’ll always have great respect for his thoughts and advice as we move forward on our journey towards becoming the best developers we can be.

To Aaron Careaga: I regret not having the opportunity to work with Aaron on a project during my time at Turing,  however I’ve always admired his ability — from afar — to take on risks and produce quality results.  He’s the kind of person who  pushes himself in and out of school, and somehow seems to squeeze out 30 hours from a normal 24 hour day.  His knowledge and friendly disposition have made him a great person to learn from and to also have as a classmate.  I’m confident that he’ll go on to do great things, and I’m hopeful that our paths will cross again down the road.

To Emily Dowdle: It was great to pair with Emily on Game Time.  We’d only paired together once before during our time at Turing, and I was happy to get one last chance before graduating.  She has a great grasp on how to get projects off the ground and knows how/when to test the right things.  Our Game Time project was one of my favorite projects from module 4 and a large part of its success was due to Emily as a teammate.

### Being a Community Member
I had the pleasure of working with Matt on Bartleby, probably the most challenging three day project I’ve ever worked on, and a student led session on Angular.  Matt picks up new tech and concepts as fast as anyone I’ve worked with.  He’s hungry and expects a lot of himself and his code, and it shows.  His (justified) confidence in his programming skills inspire confidence in the people he works with, without creating any tension or sense of superiority.  In fact, he might play down his skills and abilities more than he should.  After Turing, I hope we can continue to work together and learn from each other.  
- Matt Rooney

Matt is one of the best developers I know. His ability at thinking through problems and solving logic is supperb. He is constantly opening my eyes to what is possible, and challenging me to be a better developer. I’ve been lucky to become friends with Matt on a personal and professional level over our time at Turing, and I am sad to part ways. I can’t wait to see where he goes in his career. Any development team will be lucky to have Matt as a member.  
- Aaron Careaga

Matt was a solid partner for Game Time. We paired well together on difficult aspects of the project while splitting up other aspects of the build. Matt communicates well and shows an enthusiasm for programming. Toward the end of the project, we struggled to clean up the code and remove bugs. Even in stressful moments, Matt showed composure and thoughtfulness.

### Playing a Part

Throughout my time at Turing I feel like I've made great friends and will always feel a part of the community no matter where I am.  Aside from the usual Vault/Society gatherings, I've spent a good deal of time with other Turing students getting outside and enjoying what Colorado has to offer.  From hiking the flations with 1508'ers to weekend disc golf outings, and from rock climbing at Movement to skiing with staff and students, I will always have great memories from my community members at Turing.
