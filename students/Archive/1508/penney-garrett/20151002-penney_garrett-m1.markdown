### Your Mission

I started my journey at Turing with almost no prior programming experience and no idea what to expect. The last six weeks have been one of the toughest challenges of my life, constantly pushing me past what, in the moment, seemed reasonable or sane. Many times over this module I have hit rock bottom, feeling completely incompetent in my abilities and intelligence. But when I put things in perspective and look at where I started compared to where I am now.... it's pretty incredible. I still have a lot of work to do in order to be at the level I know I'm capable of, but I've grown by leaps and bounds over the last month and a half and I'm excited to continue the journey.

My main goal this module was to absorb as much information as possible while imparting on the intense journey of retraining my brain. I committed to that wholeheartedly, but ultimately came up a bit short and will be repeating. This work is drastically different from anything else I've done thus far, so it's taking some extra time for me to wrap my head around it all and soak it in. But I have learned so many valuable lessons along the way and, most importantly, I feel excited to continue forward and revisit all the projects I know I can improve.

### End of Module Assessment

from Jeff Casimir:

* Decent syntax and problem solving
* Knowledge of enumerable tools feels shakey/rusty
* Don't feel like you're in a place to solve hard problems without support

##### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental
concepts

##### 2. Ruby Style
* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

##### 3. Blocks & Enumerations
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

##### 4. Testing
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

##### 5. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### 6. Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


### Attendance

The only day I missed was field day. I was feeling spread pretty thin and under-rested, so I choose to take a personal day and recuperate.

### Work

Individual projects:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

We had to build a playable game of Mastermind that would run in a REPL interface. Mastermind is a game where one person (in this case the computer) creates a secret combination of colors and the other person (you!) has to guess the secret combo in the right order. Each turn the player is provided feedback regarding how many correct colors they have and how many are in the proper position. Upon guessing the correct sequence the player is told how many guesses and how long it took them.

Assessed by: Tess

* Feels like she had to ask for a lot of help. Told her that as long as you attempt it yourself first and understand everything, asking for help is a       good thing.
* Used a Game class. Impressed with that on no lessons with classes.
* Had long color check methods that were giant if else elsif blocks. That would be the first thing to refactor.
* Great project overall.

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4


#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

Chisel is a markdown to HTML parser.

Assessed by: Tess

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* Test-Driven Development: 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* Functionality: 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beat uses a Linked List to create a drum machine that a user can interact and play with.

Assessed by: Andrew

* Functional Expectations 2
* Test-Driven Development 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components 3

## Team

### Projects

Collabortive projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This project, inspired by Alan Turing, uses Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed by: Andrew

"Tests could be more robust. Example - used a lot of refute or assert instead of assert_equal when appropriate. This was due to some random nature of some of the elements. Could have focused on some more edge cases and different scenarios.""

* Overall Functionality 4
* Fundamental Ruby and Style 3
* Test-Driven Development 2
* Breaking Logic into Components 3

From Aaron Careaga: "Penney helped me better understand the project goals and notice gaps in my knowledge. I think she understands a lot more than she realizes and should be more confident in her ability."


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This project analyzes CSV datasets centered around schools in Colorado.

From Sekhar Paladugu: "Penney was such a wonderful partner to work with. We had a slow and frustrating start on Headcount, where we struggled to figure our parsing, and we had no idea what the scope of the project was. At first my impressions were that Penney mainly had a confidence issue and, while she got the material, she would doubt herself and get too wound up to make progress on her own. The smart/not smart dichotomy didn't and doesn't seem like a helpful way to view people in general and especially at Turing. I gave her this feedback as we worked through Headcount and we continued to plug away as a team without major issues/miscommunication. I was away at a multiple day wedding all weekend in Texas which added to the project stress.

While she struggled at first with writing the methods/starting the coding, she put in solid work writing out the tests (hundreds of lines of writing), a dozen plus fixtures (which we never used), and laid the legwork for us to later easily test the methods as we wrote them. This set us up well and as we finish up the project I'm grateful for Penney's hard work in the beginning. During the final week while Penney did not pass her assessment and decided to repeat the module, she on the other hand became much more focused and calm and doubled down on the project, even though this did not have any bearing given that she already knew she was going to repeat.

I am so grateful to have worked with Penney by the end of this, which is the opposite of what I've heard many people experience working together so intensely under stress as a pair. Penney moved mountains to get all of the enrollment methods to work, and we refactored together with help from Lovisa and Torie and we have a solid final project coming together. Penney's leg work on parsing difficult/tedious issues that involved many difficult concepts (enumerable methods, hashes etc.) sorted out my own roadblocks. She clearly gets the material better than many of the folks passing Module 1, and knows parts of the material (TDD, etc.) better than me for sure. Thanks for everything Penney! This final stretch has been so much more fun that I imagined :) I'm proud of the work we've done and know you'll be an awesome professional programmer after Turing."

### Giving Feedback

For Aaron Careaga: "Aaron was a great partner for Enigma. He is excellent at breaking apart and tackling complicated problems. When the going gets tough he stays calm and just approaches the issue from a different angle. And on a personal note, I'm still struggling a lot with feeling capable enough, and Aaron stayed patient and encouraging the entire process. I really learned a lot from him and feel I've definitely made a friend and ally."

For Shannon Paige: "You were a joy to pair with and I think we collaborated really well, easily and fluidly filling in the gaps for each other. Exercisms are tough and I have a lot of trouble with them by myself - but with your patience and expertise we were able to move through them efficiently and I feel like I learned a lot. You explain difficult concepts really, really well. I honestly think you should consider teaching this stuff when you're done with school. I'm so grateful for you!"

For Sekhar Paladugu: "You are the kind of partner everyone wishes they had. I consistently felt supported and heard, and whenever the going got tough you easily and rationally talked us through it. Pairing with you on Headcount absolutely made me a better and more confident programmer. You are easy to communicate with, you were always making me laugh, you respected every personal boundary I needed along the way... this was an intense and difficult project that I ended up really enjoying because I got to build it with you. I am proud of this project and feel ownership over it in a way I haven't yet felt about any other project. Thanks so much friend!"

### Being a Community Member

From Shannon Paige: "I loved working with Penney on enumerables because you can see her mind working. She doesn't think that she understands stuff, but it's because she's trying to understand it at a deeper level than most of our classmates, and she gets more than she thinks she does. She definitely taught me a thing or two while we were working together! Even though we won't be in the same module, we are definitely going to keep working together!"

### Playing a Part

I wear my heart on my sleeve and several people have appreciated and thanked me for my honesty and openness. This program is really difficult and because we are all hard-workers and over-acheivers it can be challenging to admit how stressed and tired we are, to admit we might fail, to ask for help over, and over, and over again. In a zen-like fashion this program strips away the ego in order to build it back up through hard work and resiliency. I have been extremely forthcoming with my peers about how much I've struggled and also how much I appreciate all the help I have received along the way.

I make a habit of tidying up the workspaces and restocking the bathrooms throughout the day.

Now that I feel better situated at Turing and have built a solid technical foundation, I hope to be able to give back more by helping others who are struggling and also being more involved in community events and activities.

The walrus was my idea.
