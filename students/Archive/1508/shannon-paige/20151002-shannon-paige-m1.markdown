# Shannon Paige - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
I want to learn how to think eloquently while programming. What I'm learning is that beautiful code isn't as easy to identify as beautiful math proofs. But, I think I've started to develop my own style and I've found some mentors that will help me work on it.

One of my other goals for this module was to become a master of command line execution and keybindings. I know how important these skills are, and this seemed like the module to nail them. I'm not quite there yet, but I think I got a great start thanks to Josh Cheek's exercises.

Something that is also important to me is to become part of the community - Turing and developers. I started to work on that this module by attending Turning events and Denver Ruby meet-ups.

### End of Module Assessment

I've spoken a conferences around the country, been on stage in front of hundreds of people and I've never been nervous the way I was during this assessment. The only reason I can think of is because this is so important to me. Thank you to Mike for his patience, while everything I knew disappeared from my brain and I struggled to get it back.

### Attendance

I didn't miss any days this module.

### Work

Below is a list of the individual projects I completed this module.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This project was really fun, although its when I realized that I'm not coding like everyone else, and my math background may be hurting me more than helping me. I have some tricks up my sleeves from math proofs that I used here that when I showed to my mentors made then say nononono (even though it worked). It made me realize I need to focus on enumerable and not try to reinvent the wheel in every method.

"When working with a file, you have to remember to close it, one alternative is to use a block, and then Ruby will ensure that that file gets closed, even if an exception is raised. Another nice way is to just say File.write, and let that method deal with all of the details."
"Testing at a good level"
"The painful shit (File reading / writing, ARGV, printing) are all separated from the algorithm."
"Work on choosing names that help you think about what the thing is."

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4-

#### Binary Search Trees

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

This was the project where linked lists and recursion finally clicked for me. It took me forever to figure out how to navigate this tree, but once I finally did all the previous projects started to make more sense as well.

"Pretty good test names, a way to improve them would be to describe the behavior"
"Some edge cases that would be worth testing"
"Pushing logic down into the nodes would simplify it"

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)

I had an instinct for how linked lists worked with iteration right away, so I jumped into the project using that methodology. I wish I has used recursion, and will probably go back over the break and try it that way. Although I thought I understood what was happening, it wasn't until binary search trees that they really clicked.

"Recommended adding more tests to cover more cases."

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby: 4
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

I felt I had a bit of an advantage with sorting suite, as I had studied these algorithms at length in college. It had been awhile - and I never coded them - but I knew how they worked, so I didn't have that same hurdle as my other classmates. I enjoyed jumping into this project and getting to know Ruby and Git.

"Good test names, I nitpicked"
"Actually broke out methods in bubble sort"
"Everything structured correctly, on github"

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 4
* Organization: 4

## Team

### Projects

Below is a list of the team projects I completed this module.

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/webserver)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project was really interesting to me personally coming from the digital marketing world. I've been reading Google Analytics data for so long without having any idea of how it worked, and now I do. It was super fun to play with building our own server.

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3.5
* Code Sanitation: true
* Adoration Points: none
* Knowledge Retention: 10/10

"Shannon was a joy to work with. Very easy to collaborate with and brings a lot of knowledge to the table. I definitely picked up some tips and tricks working with her."

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ShannonPaige/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

I learned so much from this project. The most important lesson was how to be comfortable being uncomfortable :) But second to that was how important it is to keep you data cleaning/parsing from the program that uses the data. I will definitely take that lesson with me to every project from now on.

"Play with the enumerables until you can think in them :)"

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

"I think we paired well because we have separate strengths. She is fast and has ideas that she can run with and I enjoy working through the methods, test-writing, and trouble shooting."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Sekhar has been my rock during this program. Any time I thought I would freak out, he would say something funny and put everything in perspective. During "programming is fun" I thought I would pull my hair out, but his ability to keep me level headed is the only reason we were able to get through it. Thank you for being a friend."

"I loved working with Penney on enumerables because you can see her mind working. She doesn't think that she understands stuff, but it's because she's trying to understand it at a deeper level than most of our classmates, and she gets more than she thinks she does. She definitely taught me a thing or two while we were working together! Even though we won't be in the same module, we are definitely going to keep working together!"

"Jill is a pleasure to work with because she's so open and positive. When we worked on "flatten" together, she made it fun. I hope we get partnered together on more stuff in the future."

"Robbie is amazing to work with. His understanding of Ruby is completely intimidating and inspiring. My only compliant would be that he needs to slow down and wait for the rest of us to catch up!"

"Charissa likes to tackle problems on her own, she always got them, but would have benefitted from asking for help more, from me or others. I move at a faster pace, so it probably made it intimidating to try and work on code together, but our ideas merged nicely."

### Being a Community Member

From Penney: "You were a joy to pair with and I think we collaborated really well, easily and fluidly filling in the gaps for each other. Exercisms are tough and I have a lot of trouble with them by myself - but with your patience and expertise we were able to move through them efficiently and I feel like I learned a lot. You explain difficult concepts really, really well. I honestly think you should consider teaching this stuff when you're done with school. I'm so grateful for you!"

From Cole: "I'm so happy that me, you, Sekhar, tori and Charissa car pooled and got to know each other better.  I had a wonderful time at Lulzbot, at the cajun restaurant at the antique store and eventually at the 'field' (which was mostly just a dusty parking lot).  Drinks and apps at Hamburger Marys was the perfect end to such a great day.  I wish every day at Turing was as enjoyable! Thanks for showing me pictures of Zander when I was crying.  Seeing him in a super hero costume made me feel much better"

From Jill: "Shannon not only understands coding on such a high level, but also strives to boost everyone else's knowledge.  She is an incredible teacher and I walked away from our mini challenge with confidence, a greater understanding of the material, and a smile on my face.  Shannon is an incredible person to pair with, one of the hardest working students in our cohort, and an even better friend during tough times.  She will make a great developer one day and any company should consider themselves lucky to have her."

From Sekhar: "You carried this project through! I was super tired from having stayed up the night before to do Jungle Beat, and we were three hours away from a project-free weekend. But overall I thought you were diligent, willing to experiment/try new techniques, and push the project along throughout. I was a much less helpful partner given my mental state. Thanks for driving it along! We finished with a 90% complete/working project as I recall. <3<3<3 Keep up the great work! You are a great partner."

I also got a shoutout during the Collaboration Games exercise for being someone that inspires others. I believe they called me a pit bull when it came to gathering knowledge (that simile stuck with me...)

I also had a MrSpec whale and a Matz posse logo designed (for free!)

### Playing a Part

During the first couple of weeks I posted motivational messages on the private 1508 message board, until I heard it wasn't as appreciated as I hoped it would be. I've also tried to always be available to help my fellow 1508 students when they needed help on their projects.
Sekhar and I have also revitalized the Matz posse (we will be the most senior members next module.)

## Review
