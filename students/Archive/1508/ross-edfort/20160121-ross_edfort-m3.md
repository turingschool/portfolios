### Your Mission

At the beginning of module 3 I set a goal to contribute more to the community at
Turing. I wanted to do more than just "pass the module". This meant spending extra
time preparing student led sessions, writing blog posts, and helping at meetups


### Attendance

I did not miss any days during this module

### Work

Module 3 is about becoming a professional web application developer. This involves
consuming and building API's, optimizing database interaction through cacheing and
background workers, and learning ajax, which opens up powerful client-side possibilities.
Starting with The Pivot, the projects just keep getting harder. During the course
of the module I've built projects that consume API's, build API's, and do both.

#### API Curious

* [Production App](http://flickr-curious.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

API Curious is a project where I was required to create a 'clone' of a popular
social media service by using their API. I chose to clone flickr, a photo hosting
service where members can post pictures, comment, add tags, groups, etc.

In this project, we used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes
the SalesEngine data schema. Our solutions were run against a spec harness that had
over 36,000 assertions

Comments:
Great project. Some ruby for queries. 100% completion. Did not use serializers so
api design was a 3. Tests were good but could have done more at the model level.

## Team

### Projects

The only group project I participated in this module was The Pivot. I was paired
with Jerrod and Jill, and we were assigned Jill's old code base

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jillmd501/the_pivot)
* [Production App](http://stalk-photos.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot is an extension of the Little Shop project from Module 2. Groups are
assigned a code base, and tasked with turning it into a completely different
e-commerce application that supports multiple tenants. My group worked with the
[ColoRIDEo](http://colorideo.herokuapp.com/) codebase and turned it into a stock-photo website.

Evaluated By: Andrew & Josh

Comments:
Not seeded with appropriate amounts of data. UI was otherwise generally good.
There were issues with images overlapping buttons and other content which was
apparently due to the person styling on a computer set up with different display
preferences. App crashed when trying to load image from category page. Could not
update user profile photo either.

###### Feedback to Me
* From Jerrod: Youâ€™re a very nice, easy to work with person. You always seem
willing to take on new challenges even if they seem a bit unachievable or intimidating at first.

* From Jill: There is no way around it - the pivot is a beast of a project where
a lot of groups can go south.  Ross felt like the glue that kept us together
and made the hellish two weeks fly by.  Every win, even if Ross worked on it solo,
felt like a W for the entire team.  I am not worried about Ross finding a job
because he is a rare find where not only is his front end work impeccably clean,
but his backend knowledge corroborates the app as a whole. Great guy and an even
better partner that I would be happy to work with again.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* To Jill: Jill was an absolute pleasure to work with during the pivot. She was
highly motivated to work, and remained this way throughout the duration of the project.
Her insights were alway helpful, and she has a great collaborative work style.
I would recommend that she keep her excellent work ethic and attitude through Turing,
and into the workplace.

* To Jerrod: Jerrod was a pleasure to work with during the pivot. Whenever we ran
into bugs, he was always looking for a solution, and his contributions were always
helpful. I learned a lot from working with him.
