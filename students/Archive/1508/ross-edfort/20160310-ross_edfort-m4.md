## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to become not only a developer in terms of my technical skill, but
in my ability to communicate intelligently about writing code. I set a goal to start the
job hunt early, and ideally accept a position before graduation. I wanted to accomplish this by
attending more meetups, and networking extensively.

### Work

My only individual project this module was RealTime.

#### RealTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)
* [Production App](https://boiling-temple-53818.herokuapp.com/)

Realtime involved building an application using JavaScript and Socket.io to allow the server and connected
clients to get a real-time representation of data. In my case, I chose to building a polling application
where the results of the poll were updated as the votes came in.

### Projects

This module, we worked on two pair projects. They were GameTime and the Scale-up.

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Production App](http://rossedfort.github.io/flappy-bird/)

For this project, Robbie and I paired to build a replica of Flappy Bird for the browser. We used images drawn on the canvas, keyboard
input, and our own collision detection to accomplish this.

#### ScaleUp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/bartleby)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)

For this project I paired with Robbie to create an Desktop note-taking application. We used Ember and Electron to
accomplish this.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Robbie is one of the most talented and driven individuals I've met at Turing. Working with Robbie will always result in a finished product that is not only clean and polished on the front-end, but logically sound and well factored on the back-end. Robbie has the ability to tackle unique and complicated problems with ease. I'm thankful to have worked with Robbie as many times as I have, and look forward to continuing our friendship and collaboration after Turing.

### Being a Community Member

It has been an absolute pleasure getting to know Ross and I feel fortunate to have been able to collaborate on a few different projects with him during my time at Turing. Ross is an excellent developer who has the ability to think outside the box and tackle difficult problems. He has a strong work ethic, is easy to work with, and most importantly, he gets shit done. I am stoked we will both be staying in Denver and I look forward to collaborating in the future.

### Playing a Part

This module I was assigned to a new posse as the posse anchor. I took this on knowing full well it would mean doing some extra work trying to
lead the posse in our morning sessions. That being said, everyone in the posse came together really well, and we were able to get the challenges done.

I also led a student led session during week one. I attended several of the Turing community night events to support the instructors who were
facilitating them.

As part of the ScaleUp project, we were required to write a blog post. Here is mine

We were also encouraged to either write or contribute to a Node Library. Here are my contributions
