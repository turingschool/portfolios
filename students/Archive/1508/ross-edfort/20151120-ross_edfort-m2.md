# Ross Edfort - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

For module 2, I set out to gain as much knowledge about using the rails framework
as possible, while still maintaining a solid understanding of ruby and remaining
active in the community. I intended to maintain best ruby practices by working through the
enumerable exercises and to maintain active in the community by attending extra-curricular activities
and meetups.

Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support

Rails Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs

Testing

Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Attendance

I did not miss any classes or days during this module

### Work

This module, most of my individual work consisted of basic CRUD apps using ruby on rails. We were guided through tutorials to build the following apps.

* [My Jams](https://github.com/rossedfort/my-jams)
* [Blogger](https://github.com/rossedfort/blogger)
* [Contact Manager](https://github.com/rossedfort/contact_manager)
* [Robot World](https://github.com/rossedfort/robot_world)

## Team

### Projects

Below are the three team projects I completed this module

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/src_traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

Description:For this project I worked with Cole Hall and Sekhar Paladugu. We built a simple application that simulated
a web traffic tracker. We used Ruby, Sinatra, HTML & CSS. We could simulate a client signing up with our app,
and simulate payloads of data for their site through cURL requests. We parsed and displayed the data according
to the project specifications.

Evaluator: Andrew

Comments: Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.

Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

Feedback to me: "Ross pushed hard on this project and set high standards, helping us finish a completed traffic spy with solid scores. I learned a lot from how he approaches problems and his knowledge helped me learn new concepts like MVC better. Thanks!"

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)
* [Heroku URL](http://lit-lake-7364.herokuapp.com/)

Description: For this un-evaluated mini-project, my pair Emily Dowdle and I completed
a basic rails crud app for storing ideas. Users were able to create and account with our app
and keep track of their ideas and the categories to which they belonged. We implemented
2 extensions by using RSpec for our testing suite, and OAuth for our authorization process.

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/lens_lease)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Heroku URL](http://lens-lease.herokuapp.com/)

Description: For the Little shop of Orders project I worked with Robbie Lane and Tyler Komoroske. We built a rental service for photographers. A user could create an account with us, add items to their cart, and checkout. We implemented the stripe API to handle "payments" and integrated Twilio for order confirmation through text messages.

Evaluator: Rachel

Comments: notes: visually pleasing site. a few bumps (cart quantity of 0, cart not clearing after order).
high test coverage, but would like to see more model tests. good attempt at using a PORO for order completion;
make sure that actions for order creation happen atomically.

Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 3
* Views: 3.5
* Controllers: 3.5
* Models: 3.5
* Testing: 3.5
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* Tyler was awesome during our little shop project. He was dedicated and motivated the entire time. His ideas were always helpful and insightful, and pushed the progress of the project even further. I think that in order to improve group workflow, Tyler could work on his own workflow process. At one point, there were several issues checked out on waffle under his name. I also encourage him to work on his keyboard shortcuts. Overall, I would definitely enjoy working with Tyler in the future

* Robbie is an excellent team member because he is efficient, motivated, and incredibly easy  to work with. When he took on pieces of functionality on his own, he always came back with something that was not only finished, but exceeded my expectations. His relaxed, yet efficient work style is something I admire. I donâ€™t have anything that I would recommend for Robbie to improve upon. I would absolutely work with Robbie again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

* Ross pushed hard on this project and set high standards, helping us finish a completed traffic spy with solid scores. I learned a lot from how he approaches problems and his knowledge helped me learn new concepts like MVC better. Thanks!

* Ross was an absolute joy to work with. He has an amazing work ethic and such a solid understanding of ruby and rails that it was easy to bounce ideas off each other and felt like a truly collaborative process. Ross put in the time necessary to go the extra mile and his attention to detail made our final product feel polished and complete. I look forward to collaborating with Ross again in the future.

* Ross was a excellent partner to work with on little shop. He was a very hard worker and was consistently trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of deadlines. He was definitely committed to turing in an above average finished product. He also took constantly took initiative to implement features on his own. As for areas of improvement, sometimes I would say things and Ross did not acknowledge that I had even said anything. I think this was just a product of his own concentration, and he definitely was not intentionally ignoring me. This sort of make me feel stupid at times for mentioning my idea. Overall, Ross is great teammate and would definitely enjoy working with him again.

### Playing a Part

This module I gave back to the Turing community in a few ways. I created a Slack channel open to anyone who enjoys Frisbee Golf.
Since creating the channel, many people have joined and we've had several outings. I believe this is improving the community
by allowing students an outlet to relax and get in some light exercise. I also created an informal Hardware group with Regis which
will meet every Sunday at 2:00pm. Before community night, I helped mount 2 new TV's
in the Big Workspace

## Review

### Notes

* Continued working on Ruby while getting into Rails.
* Did better at remaining active in the community.
* Started getting into meetups. 
* Challenge yourself and those around you to take on extra challenges. 
* Coninue to push yourself and others
* Coninue to be, and try to be inclusive within your cohort.
* Be more attentive to group members going forward. 

### Outcome

Pass
