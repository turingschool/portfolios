### Your Mission

My mission during this module was to grow in ways that were previously not
possible for me. I explicitly set out to learn Ruby down to the lowest level,
not realizing that higher level thinking would have occupied me just fine. I
wanted to: help others grow, teach them, give them confidence in themselves and
show them that the intensity of the assignments will subside, but quitting or
not trying would last with them forever. The exact opposite happened when I
was the person needing the assistance, confidence boost, and pep talks. These
moments have shaped me tremendously and are the real reason why I have grown.
I am better than I've every been right at this very moment.

### End of Module Assessment

Final Assessment Scores:

1. Ruby Syntax & API

    3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

2. Ruby Style

    3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

3. Blocks & Enumerations

    3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

4. Testing

    4: Developer consistently takes small steps, using the tests for both design and verification

5. Workflow

    4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

6. Collaboration

    3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

On Tuesday September 8th, I missed a full day of class in order to take care of
my little brother who had fallen ill on his trip to visit me.

### Work

I think I struggled the most coming in to Turing. My initial efforts look almost
lackadaisical, but I assure you, they were extremely hard fought. The battle
was discouraging in the beginning...now I somewhat enjoy it.

#### Sorting_Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Sorting_Suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

Sorting suite was, and still is, a difficult assignment for me. Multiple times
since, I've tried to implement the merge sort algorithm and it still doesn't
come as naturally as I'd like. However, it was a great assignment in showing
me that I can in fact think algorithmically. This was also the lowest score I've
gotten on an assignment.

Evaluation Comments

No tests were given. Only bubble sort was completed. Indentation was incorrect.
No directory structure.

Evaluation Scores

Functional Expectations - 1
Ruby Syntax             - 1
Organization            - 1
Testing                 - 1

#### GitRepo

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Git_Repo)

GitRepo was a quick Github assignment I found online.

#### Still I Rise

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Poetry_One)

still_i_rise.txt was an exercise issued during class in order to teach about
Git and Github repos.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

Enigma was the project that I was able to truly shine at. Programming finally
started to have a natural flow for mre right around the time of this project,
though not completely. I was able to truly build an application I was proud of.

Evaluation Comments

Let them have the four on overall. Only issue was not following the runner
specifications. Code could have been cleaned up. Could have done some refactoring,
but fairly well split apart in general.

Evaluation Scores

Functional Expectations - 4
Ruby Syntax             - 3
TestDrivenDevelopment   - 3
Breaking Logic Down     - 3

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/Headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite)

Headcount was an amazing project. I finally feel like a programmer This project got me
excited enough at one point that I didn't want to leave my computer. I started
reworking through past problems and figuring those out as well. It finally "clicked"
for me. Too bad it was on the last day.

Evaluation Scores

Functional Expectations  -  3
Ruby Syntax              -  3
TDD                      -  3
BreakingLogic            -  3

## Team

I was a partner with Jill Donohue on Headcount and John Slota on Enigma.


## Community

The way I contributed to the Turing community was by being there for my classmates
during the module. Each of us, at one point in time had broken down and needed
some help whether it was physical problem solving help or emotional help. I tried
to be the shoulder everyone could cry on/the guy anyone could talk to. Since we all
did this, made our cohort exceptionally close.

### Giving Feedback

Turing is a great opportunity for me to step outside of my comfort zone and
truly learn/become a better member of society. The atmosphere is conducive to
growth in particular and allows one the freedom and flexibility needed to be
successful. I have nothing but good things to say about the program.

### Being a Community Member

“Marlo approached our first day of Headcount with confidence as we worked through every tiny detail of the project outline before even typing a single word.  Marlo stays calm under high pressure environments and exudes a supportive attitude not only for school work, but also for his peers.  I can personally credit Marlo as one of the reasons why I decided not to leave the program which I cannot even begin to thank him for.  I must say his only flaw from working together is that I enjoy talking to him more than working on projects!  Marlo’s confidence, calming demeanor, and his “never give up” attitude will all come together to make him an incredible developer.  I have no doubt that Marlo will do great things for the tech industry and community as a whole."
-Jill Donohue

"Marlo was a fantastic partner on the best project I had in module I. We had some great DTR as I let him know early on
that I wouldn't be available to work over the weekend due to a pre-planned trip. We were able to shift the duties around
so that we had everything finished and ready to go. He is a team player, level headed and a blast to work with."
-John Slota

## Review


### Notes

* Stretch community paraticipation expectations. Do a consistent small thing.

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
