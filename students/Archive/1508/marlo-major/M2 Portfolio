I# Marlo Major - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission during module 2 was explicitly to tackle the areas in my life that I pretty much let go. During module one, my health went down the drain, I slept little to not at all, and didn't exercise pretty much at all. This module, I wanted to have a healthier body in order to be able to handle the rigors of the marathon that is module two. I also set out to make a difference or an impact on the community.

### End of Module Assessment

Final Assessment Scores:

#### Notes

* Comfortable scoping capybara tests
* Took small steps with testing to drive development... sometimes ;)
* Comfortable creating routes, controllers, actions, views
* Some confusion with data prep in test (didn't start with setup, used new instead of create)
* Able to generate model from command line
* Some confusion with generating migration from command line
* Confused about iterating to create new div per use (generally shaky with view stuff)
* Used save_and_open_page for debugging
* Able to predict what should happen before running test
* Weak with Ruby implementation


1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

  2: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

3. Rails Syntax & API

  3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style

  3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing

  3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration

  4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Attendance

On Friday, November 13, I missed the first half of school due to further preparing for my lightning talk. I get almost debilitatingly nervous before talks and so the extra prep helped me to get things together. I think it turned out well.

### Work

Module two had more tutorials than actual assignments. I learned a lot via this method and was glad to always have a reference for how i could go about implementing some feature by going back to the way that I did it during a tutorial. My main complaint is that past assignments are easy to find, often hidden deep within project repos. Github's search does not facilitate this process so it would be nice if we had an archived place to put all assignments and repos we have worked through.

#### Method for Strengthening the Weakest Member Link

Wrote an essay on how Turing can improve the individual learning experience for the people that aren't the strongest developers.

#### Why to Start a Medical Device Company (Lightning Talk)

Gave a lightning talk on why someone should start a medical device company.

#### How to Start a Medical Device Company (Student Led Session)

After the lightning talk, gave a student led session on how to build a med tech company.

#### Spacemacs

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/spacemacs)

Contributed to open source text editor that utilizes emacs and vim into one system called evil mode.

#### Haskell

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/haskell-mode-1)

Contributed to open source programming language. Was given multiple other opportunities to continue with the contributions.

#### Seeing is Believing

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/haskell-mode-1)

Contributed to the amazing open source project Seeing is Believing.

#### TrafficSpy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

TrafficSpy is the project I've struggled with the most. I didn't quite understand how to use Sinatra and I had numerous group problems that I had to work through. However, due to this struggle, I learned an incredible amount about myself. I wrote an essay about the experience and it showed up in the weekly Wellness Newsletter.

Evaluation Scores:

Functional Expectations: 2
TestDriven Development: 2
Encapsulation / Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
View Layer: 2.5

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/colorideo)

This is the best I have ever done on a project. My team worked together in a way I haven't been apart of yet at Turing. We incorporated design along the way and therefore we had a much more beautiful website than I thought we would have. The experience is one in which I will continue to reference in future projects and something I am incredibly grateful for.

## Team

I was a partner with Emily Dowdle & Charissa Law during Traffic Spy and Pat Wey & Jill Donohue for Little Shop of Orders.

## Community

I've attended DSA several times during this module. Many times I would stay after class in order to help students in module one. That was a great feeling, being able to give back to the community that gave me the opportunity to learn faster and to keep up with my class. I also helped with inviting high school students to become developers with Rachel Warbelow and other students.

### Giving Feedback

Turing has so far been the best decision I've made in my life. The faculty strive very hard to create an inviting yet thought provoking environment for the students. I wish some students didn't take the topics in GearUp the wrong way, but that is natural when talking about subjects that are as real and captivating as the topics we discuss. Turing must continue to have this conversation with students. It is absolutely necessary.

### Being a Community Member

"Working with Marlo on coloRIDEo was great. I’m definitely impressed by his work ethic - he put in a lot of hours on our project!  He keeps his cool in pressure situations, and was never flustered if we were running into problems.  He is also really positive and supportive, which helped our group stay close.  Each day he would send out a summary email highlighting and praising everything we accomplished - so cool! Oh, and he also sings while he’s working, which is a nice bonus. I’m looking forward to working with him again in the future." -Pat Wey

"Marlo is in the Weirich posse with me and he was the first person at Turing to really make me feel at home. He has a calming and mature presence that many in the community, including myself, are drawn to. I remember being stuck on my first project and working through a debugging process with him one morning. We didn't solve the problem, but that highlighted one of my favorite things about Marlo. Multiple times he checked in on me later that day, both on Slack and in person, to see if the problem had been solved. When it finally had been, instead of just saying "Great!" he was curious -- "What was the issue? How did you fix it?" He showed a genuine interest in me and my project that I didn't expect him to have. I hope I'm able to make the future cohorts/students feel as welcomed and belonging as Marlo has done for me. He's definitely a strong asset to the community." James Crockett
