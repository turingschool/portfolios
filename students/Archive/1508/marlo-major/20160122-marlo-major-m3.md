# Marlo Major - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Over the course of the past three modules, I've become a lot more realistic. I start projects that I know I can finish, I read books that I know I can comprehend, and I think thoughts that I know I can achieve. In other words, I'm no longer the dreamer I was when I arrived and this is a problem for me, because this is who I am at the core. My mission this module was to think bigger thoughts and to apply the lessons I've learned in order to accomplish grandiose ideas and believe I can accomplish greater things in software than just Rails.

### Attendance

On January 13th, 2016 I arrived to class about 15 minutes late. Other than this, I've had perfect attendance all module.

### Work

Module 3 has been my favorite module by far. From building RailsEngine to completely ruining my APICurious project due to poor Git practices and many other poor decisions, I've learned the most about myself and my ability to program during this module. I can actually program! With so much information, it's been hard keeping track of what I've learned, but I have sufficient class notes and projects to reference. Also, there's a small part of me that wishes I had built a solo project. The experience seems to have been very valuable for everyone involved. However, I'm sure this won't be the last time I build a solo project.

## Team

I had Torie Joy-Warren, Edgar Duran, and David Stinnette on ThePivot. I had Robbie Lane as a partner for the final project with Trelora.

## Community

Module 3 is my favorite module by far. Josh Mejia has a talent for connecting with students and it genuinely helps when learning topics as difficult as API consumption etc. Looking around today, I'd have to say that Turing hires mostly rockstars and that this is their competitive advantage. There really isn't any instructor I wouldn't want to learn from at this school. I grow everyday I'm here and I couldn't be luckier to be where I am right now.

### Being a Community Member

"Working with Marlo is a pleasure. I have paired with Marlo on a few occasions as well as having him as a partner in the pivot project. Marlo’s hard work led to having a very sharp looking front end, he took it upon himself to teach himself front end in order to turn in a quality product. Marlo is a hard working and dedicated developer, I have no doubt he will succeed in whatever endeavor he pursues."- Edgar Duran

"Working with Marlo is a great experience. He keeps the mood light, while also being hyper aware of how everyone is doing individually and being considerate of everyone. He constantly iterates on what works and scraps what doesn’t, and is always seeking feedback. This is makes him motivating to work with, and someone I respect immensely. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with Marlo again."-Torie Joy-Warren

"Marlo was an excellent partner to pair with on this project. He is an excellent developer and has a strong understanding of ruby and rails. He is an excellent motivator and is always driven and stays on task. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Marlo and look forward to pairing in the future."-Robbie Lane
