# Matt Rooney - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for the fourth and final module at Turing was to soak up as much JavaScript knowledge as I possibly could and begin my job search. However, about two weeks into the module I realized that I'd probably be better off focusing on JavaScript rather than be frustrated and distracted. While I'm nervous about where my job search stands, I'm glad I decided to focus on JavaScript because now I'm pretty sure I want to find a front-end job.

### End of Module Assessment

I didn't need to take the assessment.

### Work

The projects we were assigned during this module were as challenging as ever, but it's way more fun to build a real game than it is to wait for the Pivot to load.  

## Individual

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/real-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

For Real Time, I created a polling app that uses web sockets to update in... real time.

###### Evaluation

178/200 points

Good effort. Application delivers all functionality plus some additional feature to toggle comments. Test for models but lacks tests for client-side. Use of Poll class abstracts logic really well. Some code in the client-side needs to be wrapped by functions. Good workflow, it would be nice to do some final cleanup of branches at the end.

Concept and Features

* 100 points - Exceeded expectations. There are more features than we planned.

Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

Test-Driven Development

* 20 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.

Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Workflow

* 4 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


## Team

### Projects

This module I completed two pair projects, Game Time with Adam Jensen and Bartleby with Matt Stjernholm.

#### Game Time - Snake

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/snake)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

I had the pleasure of working with Adam Jensen on Game Time and we made our own version of the classic game Snake. But ours has portals! And speed mode! And VIM mode, which I still don't know how to use.

###### Evaluation

Total Points: 280/300 - Checkins: 160 Eval: 120

Functional Expectations

- 40 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

User Interface

- 15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

- 10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

JavaScript Style

- 20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

- 25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

- The output from JSHint shows… 10 points - Five or fewer complaints

#### Bartleby - BetterNotes

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/better-notes)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)

BetterNotes is a note-taking app built with Ember, Electron and FileBin. BetterNotes allows a user to create/read/update/delete notes on their filesystem, as well as search your notes by title and content and convert markdown notes to HTML.

###### Evaluation

150/150 Total Points

Blog Post - 60/60 Points - 15 points per section

Participation 30/30 points

- 30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.

Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

- 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
- 30: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.

Extension - 20/20 points
- Developer contributes to or creates an NPM module/library.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Aaron Careaga - "In my opinion, Aaron is one of the top all-around developers from our cohort.  He’s incredibly thoughtful with his code and the people he work’s with. He always thoroughly understands the code he writes and can very effectively communicate how it works. I hope, post-Turing, we can still find a way to work together and continue to learn from each other."

To Adam Jensen - "The time I spent working on Game Time with Adam was quite possibly the most fun I’ve had in my relatively short programming career.  His understanding of JavaScript was much deeper than I expected and he’s great at sharing the impressive amount of programming knowledge he holds under his red beanie.  Adam’s patience and energy make him really easy to work and pair with.  After Turing, I hope we can find a way to continue working with and learning from each other because his passion for programming is contagious and encouraging.  He also asks very good guitar and music related questions."

To Matt Stjernholm - "I had the pleasure of working with Matt on Bartleby, probably the most challenging three day project I’ve ever worked on, and a student led session on Angular.  Matt picks up new tech and concepts as fast as anyone I’ve worked with.  He’s hungry and expects a lot of himself and his code, and it shows.  His (justified) confidence in his programming skills inspire confidence in the people he works with, without creating any tension or sense of superiority.  In fact, he might play down his skills and abilities more than he should.  After Turing, I hope we can continue to work together and learn from each other."

### Being a Community Member

From Adam Jensen - "I had the opportunity to pair with Matt on our Game-Time project. I think that Game-time turned out to be my most productive assignment while in Module 4. If I could sum up the reason why we were productive, it would be because Matt is very good at staying focused (much better then I am).

GOOD: Matt helped me with plenty of Technical concerns and problems. On top of that, Matt was 110% willing to collaborate. His approach was flexible. He can work solo AND together. Even during the job search, Matt was really at balancing personal life, work life, and job hunt stress. He just does really well and making sure he is reliable. I would gladly tell anyone that they can count on Matt to finish any job.

BAD: Nothing really. Im really trying to think of something bad. I feel like matt could take more leadership during pairing. He is certainly strong enough. But sometimes, I felt like he needed to get comfortable before he was willing to throw around some ideas. This isn't really a bad critique, I just feel that he could take more of a charge and it would benefit the partnership in the long run."

From Matt Stjernholm - "I really enjoyed my time working with Matt in module 2 on Little Shop, and was grateful for another chance to team up with him during the Bartleby project in module 4.  He’s consistently been one of the most enjoyable people to pair with at Turing -- as he’s both a very strong coder and a fun person to be around.  He brings a relaxed, yet focused feel to any team environment and makes great contributions towards moving difficult projects forward.  He’s been a great partner in crime for projects and student led-sessions, and I’ll always have great respect for his thoughts and advice as we move forward on our journey towards becoming the best developers we can be."

From Aaron Careaga - "Matt is both a great developer and an awesome person to work through challenges with. His personality provides a sense of calm in the face of adversity, keeping forward progress on track. I have had the pleasure of getting to know Matt personally and professionaly, and would love to work on a team with him in the future."

### Playing a Part

* Cleaned the gross bathrooms
* Tried to give actionable feedback on surveys and to students
* Joined the Pre-work Guides
* Made coffee
* Tried to check in with my posse mates every morning to see what they were working on and how it was going, in addition to challenges.
* Spread the Turing word around DSST Stapleton Middle School during the last intermission week. Sekhar and I led the morning meeting for my wife's class to introduce students to programming and what you can do with it.
