# Matt Rooney - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission at Turing is to build an incredibly solid foundation in Ruby, Rails and thinking like a programmer. I want to focus on finding my most efficient learning process as well as identifying my deficiencies and taking action to eliminate them. All in all, I want to leave Turing with a valuable skill-set that I can use to build a career and life of interesting work and autonomy.

In module 2 I made some big steps toward achieving the goals outlined above. I was excited to dive into Rails and finally be building real web apps. I really enjoyed seeing my skills come to life in our final project. I'm more confident than ever in my programming skills and feel like I'm well on my way to becoming a solid developer.

### End of Module Assessment

Instructor: Andrew
challenge: highest scoring word
notes: Took on one of the harder challenges. And though we went a little over in time, it was fully implemented and working by the end. Struggled the most with using ruby hashes, but though some collaboration developer was able to figure it out.

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking - 3 
  * Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library - 3 
  * Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API - 3 
  * Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style - 3 
  * Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing - 3 
  * Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration - 3 
  * Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

I missed the first Thursday and Friday of the module in order to attend a very close friend's wedding.

### Work

In module 2, none of our individual work was evaluated. Below are some of the smaller assignments I completed.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following module 2 group projects:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

In this project, my partners and I built a web traffic tracking and analysis tool using Ruby, Sinatra and ActiveRecord.

Notes: Controller has more logic than desirable. Particularly "get "/sources/:identifier/events/:event_name"". Logic could have been separated more with POROS. Too many instance variables in the controller, but no logic in views. Needs to utilize more active record. Too much ruby enumerables.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 2
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/GnarPow)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Production URL](https://gnarpow.herokuapp.com)

For our version of Little Shop, my group built a store for snowboard gear using Ruby on Rails and Materialize. In addition to full crud functionality for users, we also implemented a working shopping cart, admin dashboard, item search and mailer that both sends order confirmations and allows an admin to send a featured item email to all registered users.

Comments:
* "sharp product. all features implemented correctly, added mailer and fuzzy search for extensions. good test coverage  would like to see less repetition in test data preparation."  

Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 4
* Views: 3.5
* Controllers: 3.5
* Models: 3.5
* Testing: 3.5
* Usability: 4
* Workflow: 4

#### Rails Mini-Project

For this un-evaluated pair project, Pat Wey and I built a simple gif-generator that allowed an admin to populate the app with gifs that users could then favorite. For an extra challenge we wrote our views in HAML and used Rspec for testing.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I try to always respond to my fellow students, staff and instructors with positivity. I've found that responding to my classmates questions and doubts with positivity and confidence actually helps with my confidence in my own programming abilities.

I gave the following feedback to John Slota, Chad Minnerath, Edgar Duran and Matt Stjernholm, who were my partners on group projects:

Slota - "It was fun working with you on Traffic Spy. I loved your open and honest communication throughout. Your attitude helped keep us motivated and confident. I'm glad we finally got to work together."

Chad - "Your attitude, confidence and programming skills were very much appreciated on this project. You did an awesome job keeping us focussed on the next step and out of rabbit holes. I look forward to working with you again."

Edgar - "It was great working with you again Edgar. You're easy to work with because you're always open to ideas and flexible with schedule, structure and workflow. Thanks for always keeping the mood light but focussed."

Stjernholm - "I feel like I learned a lot about front-end design from you on this project and felt that we communicated well and pushed each other to always do a little better. I hope we get the chance to work together again."

### Being a Community Member

Traffic Spy Feedback:

"I look forward to collaborating with you again: strongly_agree

I found our collaboration valuable and productive: strongly_agree

I feel you participated to the best of your abilities: strongly_agree

Comments:
Rooney, I think you did a great job and are a strong team player, I learned a lot this project and I think you were there to help me learn and grow along the way. If it wasn't for you we wouldn't have had sweet materialize code so thanks!"

Little Shop Feedback:

From Edgar Duran - "Iâ€™m very grateful to have the opportunity to work with Matt again. He is diligent and always keeps us on task and up to date.  He is a hard worker and always finds a way to solve difficult problems."

From Matt Stjernholm - "Had a great time working with Matt.  He always completed his share of the work and really did a great job of diving into uncharted waters to figure out how to complete new features.  Looking forward to working with him again in the future."

### Playing a Part

* Attended and contributed to the 1510 Intro Workshop on Oct. 8th.
* Collaborated on warm-ups with my posse members.
* Paired with Cole to work on ruby in preparation for assessment.
* Gave a lightning talk on Plasma Torch Recycling
* Throughout Module 2 I tried to be more confident and inspire more confidence in my cohort-mates and the 1510'ers on a regular basis. I really enjoyed getting to know Hector and Beth, my 1510 posse-mates, and tried to lend them a hand when I could.
* I also did more dishes this time around. And made lots of coffee.
* 

### Notes

* Was able to fucus more and be more productive. 
* Feeling more confident in programming skills
* Testing was poor for traffic spy but made a point to focus on it going forward. 
* Learned TDD was important. Still room to improve
* Does a good job trying to reach out to other cohorts, but would like to still improve. 
* Find a mentor!


### Outcome
