### Your Mission

My mission at Turing is to build an incredibly solid foundation in Ruby, Rails and thinking like a programmer. I want to focus on finding my most efficient learning process as well as identifying my deficiencies and taking action to eliminate them. All in all, I want to leave Turing with a valuable skill-set that I can use to build a career and life of interesting work and autonomy.

In module 3, my goal was to make the final steps towards becoming a "Professional Rails Developer" and I feel that I've achieved that. And now, at the end of my personal project, I've gotten my feet wet with AJAX and jQuery and can't wait to dive headfirst into JavaScript. All the solo projects in module 3 have really helped boost my confidence and I'm ready to dust off, destroy and completely re-work that ol' resume.

### Attendance

I worked from home 1.5 days this module due to sickness, both during solo project work days.

## Work

## Solo

### Projects

In module 3, most of our projects were solo. While the idea of working alone was a little intimidating at first, it really helped me solidify my skills across the board and gain more confidence in my ability to figure it out and get it done.

#### Personal Project - Koncert

Koncert consumes the Bandsintown API to find artists with upcoming concerts in your area and then uses the Spotify API to create playlists from those artists' top Spotify tracks.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md#learning-goals)

* completion: 3.5
* organization: 4
* test-driven-development: 3
* code-quality: 3
* user-experience: 3
* performance: 3

#### Rails Engine

In this project I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Notes: Solid project. Good robust controller tests, but no model tests. Could have done some more for testing. Quieries were good and had mostly activerecord, but did reach for ruby. At times I think the ruby was unnecessary and could have been accomplished fairly easily with AR.

* completion: 3
* test-driven-development: 3.5
* code-quality: 3
* api-design: 3
* queries: 3.5

#### API Curious

The point of this 4 day project was to consume a 3rd-party API, focussing on UX/UI and testing APIs.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MattRooney/APICurious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

* Completion - 3 Developer delivered all planned features.
* Organization - 4 Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development - 4 Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
* Code Quality - 4 Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* User Experience - 3 The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following module 3 group projects:

#### The Pivot

In this project, Sekhar, Pat and I built a micro-lending site by transforming an existing projects Rails codebase. The major takeaways from this project include getting comfortable with multi-tenancy, securing Rails apps, working with an existing codebase and seeding data.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Notes: Our original score on code quality was a 2, but our [refactored sessions controller](https://github.com/sekharp/the_pivot/blob/master/app/controllers/session_controller.rb) bumped it up to a 3. The [first sessions controller](https://github.com/sekharp/the_pivot/commit/7b13b57d0c7a71a8e628007b0989692d63bf2d36) was a mess. But a mess that Pat was proud of.

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I try to always respond to my fellow students, staff and instructors with positivity. I've found that responding to my classmates questions and doubts with positivity and confidence actually helps with my confidence in my own programming abilities.

I gave the following feedback to Sekhar Paladugu and Pat Wey, who were my partners on a group project, and Adam Jensen, who joined 1508 this module:

Sekhar - I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of working with Sekhar on the Pivot and a student lead session. Sekhar’s ability to thoroughly communicate during pairing and planning were crucial to our project’s and session's success. He’s always willing to help his teammates and allows everyone to feel included. I look forward to working with Sekhar again.

Pat - Pat is a pleasure to work with. He’s calm and confident and that helps a lot when you’re wrestling with an overwhelming/tedious project like the Pivot. He’s always trying to improve his programming skills and it shows in his work. He’s easy to pair with because he communicates explicitly and is open to ideas and opinions.  I look forward to working with Pat again in module 4.

Adam - In the little time I've spent working with Adam, I've realized that he's always happy to help and excited to learn. He's an awesome addition to 1508 and personally helped me understand some more advanced active record queries. I'm always excited to see what he's working on and I hope to get the chance to work more with him in mod 4.

### Being a Community Member

Pivot Feedback:

"I thoroughly enjoyed working with Matt this module on our Pivot project, a crowdfunding website for India called Ganesha Loans. Matt proved flexible and willing to jump in on any task left for him or that others felt less interested in owning, and he consistently put in long hours throughout the project to help us across the finish line. Given that the Pivot was a pretty tedious project, I also enjoyed his sense of humor and easygoing attitude. I'm glad we had a chance to work together on a team and look forward to seeing what Matt does with Javascript!" - Sekhar Paladugu

"Matt was a pleasure to work with on the Pivot.  He's calm, skilled and focused, and I appreciated his willingness to take on some of our most frustrating issues without flinching (I see you sticky footer). He is a very thoughtful developer, and has a knack for considering the implications of big picture decisions. I relied on him heavily when my work required restructuring or reworking our app. I hope we get to work together again in the future." - Pat Wey

Other Feedback:

"I haven't gotten the chance  to pair with matt as much as I would have liked, but  on a couple occasions, I've been really impressed by his communications.  He listens well, and is quick to pick up on things. I remember one instance where we discussed active record and he understood a very complex  line of code in a 10 minute session.  It took me like 7 hours to get the same line at one time so I was really pleased with matts aptitude. I also want to point out that matt has been really cool to me and is quick to strike up a conversation. This has helped me integrate  with a new cohort as I am typically pretty shy. It means a lot coming into a new group." - Adam Jensen

### Playing a Part

* Taught a Student Lead Session, with Sekhar, on Elm.
* Collaborated on warm-ups with my posse members.
* Throughout Module 3 I tried to be more confident and inspire more confidence in my classmates on a regular basis. I try to lead by example and straight up tell people to freak out less and focus on what they think they need to learn.
* Tried to do dishes whenever I used them, and participated in cohort-cleanup.
* Never ever, I mean never, no matter when, no matter where, never left the coffee pot empty after taking the last cup.
* Spreading the Turing word around DSST Stapleton Middle School during the upcoming intermission week, leading the morning meeting for my wife's class to introduce students to programming and what you can do with it.
