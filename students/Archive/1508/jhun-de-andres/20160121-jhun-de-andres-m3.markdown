# (Jhun de Andres) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission this module was to continue to stay hungry and curious. My time here at turing has been a roller coaster. I was told in Module one that I had barely passed and that I probably would repeat another Module if not 1 something down the line. That lit a fire under me and I really wanted to understand programming. After that programming became something I began to love because of the ambiguity. At the end of my portfolio assessment in Module 2 I was given some really positive feedback and I want to make sure I kept that upward trend. I wanted to work hard to make sure I was making my instructors proud. I am thankful for the staff here and there ability to pour into their students. Needless to say I wanted to learn how to embrace not knowing all the things and feeling confident I can make something happen.

### Attendance
Due to a family emergency I missed one day of school. December 18th, 2015

### Work
These are the projects I worked on throughout this module. I found that after each of my projects I started to progress in areas I struggled in.
(Intro)

#### (API Curious)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/joshuajhun/chisel)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md]

(Description)
  This was fun! We learned OAuth and how to consume and API. We built a twitter clone and over all I enjoyed this project.

(Scores)
Feature Delivery

1. Completion: 3 Developer delivered all planned features.
2. Organization: 3 Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

Technical Quality

1. Test-Driven Development: 2 Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests

2. Code Quality: 3 Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
Product Experience

1. User Experience: 3 The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

(Evaluation Comments)
  - solid implementation of baseline features - view my tweets; fetch user info; post a tweet; favorite a tweet

  - got some start on the testing; seems like we had a few issues with VCR etc; overall number of tests is lacking
  and there are still some problems with managing the connection to API data

  - like the use of twitter api objects to manage connection to the external data

  - user creation process could probably be tidied up -- seems like we are doing some unnecessary saving / updating              of db records


#### (Rails Engine)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/joshuajhun/rails_engine)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md]

(Description)
  Sales Engine lives one. This time we'll be using Active Record to query an actual database. We pull in the same csv data and query the DB.
(Scores)
  1. completion: 3
  2. test-driven-development: 3
  3. code-quality: 3
  4. api-design: 3
  5. queries: 3

(Evaultation Comments)
  -  Most important thing to work on moving forward is refactoring. Code quality was ok, but could have reworked    some queries. Only one piece of logic in controller, but it was the last thing being worked. No model level tests and some gaps controller test robustness.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (The Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/ticketly)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md]

(Discription)
This project's focus was about being able to take legacy code and implement and completely turn it on its head. We took a site that was selling destinations and trips to a multitenancy site that sold tickets. We hand rolled security and everything else. It was fun.

(Scores)

Product and Feature Delivery
  1. Completion: 3
  2. Organization: 4
  3. User Experience: 3

Technical Quality
  1. Test-Driven Development: 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
  2. Code Quality: 3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

  Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

(Evaluation Comments)
  - Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status. Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.

  - Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.
  Scores

#### (Trelora LeaderBoard)

(Discription)
  For our self directed project me and Aaron worked on building an application for the people at Trelora. We had to created a leaderboard that automatically updates every five minutes with new ratings.

(Scores)
  instructor: Josh M.
  1. completion: 4
  2. organization: 4
  3. test-driven-development: 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
  4. code-quality: 3 Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  5. user-experience: 4 Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
  6. performance: 2  Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.

(Evaluation Comments)
   - Mostly JS and very little Ruby. Pushed boundaries on what was taught in class. All data on the page is loading using AJAX.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I love affirming people. I don't know if thats a real thing, but I want people to know that their hardwork doesn't go unseen. So I'll do my best to affirm and shout out people the most I can. The one thing I find encouraging is seeing my name in a shout-out email and people saying that they appreciate me for being myself.
(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

"I always want someone as joyful as you in my life. You probably don’t know it, but on a lot of rough days, I’d get a big smile and a hello from you, and it made my day better. You bring such a much needed spirit to this place. I admire your commitment to young people, and to the community. I’d love to stay in touch and talk about cool projects together, and creative things we can do with programming.” - Mary Beth Burch`

"I am so glad we partnered on building Trelora an internal dashboard for our final project in Module 3. Your positive energy and drive to implement JavaScript and AJAX across the entire application allowed us to reach project extensions, and greatly enhanced my level of knowledge. I really appreciate your willingness to take on new challenges and grit to overcome hurdles that we encountered. Wherever you land, that development team will be extremely lucky to have you as a partner." - Aaron Carega

"Jhun is great at collaborating. The most interesting thing about Jhun is that he can tackle the assignment that is given to him. That is cool and all. But in retrospect, I would say that his other skills are the ones that shine the most. To the point, Jhun is like the happiest guy I know. This sounds 'meh' but it made a huge difference everytime I work with him and is probably the biggest reason why I choose to work with Jhun.

This attribute should be highlighted and rewarded. It is rare to say the least" - Adam Jensen
" Jhun came to me for some JS help working on the Trelora project. We debugged the problem for a bit and he was excellent at walking through the code and showing the root of the problem. Not afraid to ask for help when he needs it, and confidence to tackle problems on this own; Jhun will be a great developer. Keep it up man!" - Michael Merrill

### Playing a Part

- I helped Travis teach kids how to code at DSST
- Lead a class on how to effect change in the inner-city
