# (Jhun de Andres) - (M4) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My Mission this module was to learn as much about JavaScript. I was super jazzed about it exiting module 3 and I wanted to make sure I continued learning about it. Another goal of mine for module 4 was to continue taking risks. I found that if I stayed comfortable I never grew and I needed to 'stack on some weight' if I wanted to be successful. I also wanted to start up blogging again and I found that the more I blogged the more excited I was about programming and the happier I was as a student.

#### Instructor Feedback
Points: (base 300)
Checkins: 150
Eval: 118

Total: 268

####Functional Expectations

  20 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

####User Interface
  15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

####Testing

  25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

####JavaScript Style

  20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

####Workflow

  25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

####Code Sanitation
  The output from JSHint shows…

## Attendance
Due to a family emergency I missed one full day of school. Feb. 9th, 2016

### Work
These are the projects I worked on throughout this module. I found that after each of my projects I started to progress in areas I struggled in.

(Description)
The goal of this project was to create an application that leverages the power of websockets. This app is supposed to pull data from it's users in real time and display it.

Concept and Features -

####Does it have the expected features?

75 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

####Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

####Client-Side Application

20 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.

####Test-Driven Development

10 points - Many areas of the code are not covered by tests.

###Interface

5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

###Workflow

5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
(Evaluation Comments)
- Watch out for the fragility of code - for example, the chaining of [something].something.somethingElse which relies on each piece of the chain never returning undefined - the bugs that we looked at during the eval seem to all be related to that.

- Don't be sad time!

## Scale Up

(Description)
  The point of this application was to introduce us to ember and also the electron.js. It was probably one of my favorite application because we were able to take some really cool risk and actually contribute to the open source community. We ended up using ocrad.js and building an npm module that allows users to utilize the power of OCR.

(Scores)
####Instructor Evaluation:

####Points: (160)

Rubric

####Blog Post (60 Points)

####Participation (30 points)

30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.

####Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.(50 points)

50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

####Extension (20 points)
Developer contributes to or creates an NPM module/library

## Community
### Giving Feedback

I love affirming people. I don't know if thats a real thing, but I want people to know that their hardwork doesn't go unseen. So I'll do my best to affirm and shout out people the most I can.

### Being a Community Member

"Where do I start about Jhun! Personally, the dude means a lot. Nobody else in 1508 brings as much personality to the cohort. I don't care what others say really. I am happy to be a 1508'er because of Jhun. Much of my turing experience has been because of this guy.

Jhun means alot to me. We connect on issues and topics that are more important than code. I personally have received alot of emotional support from Jhun ever since I've known him. The crazy thing is that I know Jhun is just as (or more) important to EVERYONE. The guy is infectious and Turing is lucky to have him on board."
- __Adam Jensen__

"Jhun is not only a brilliant developer but also one of my greatest friends. He always has a positive attitude and is a pleasure to work with on any challenge. I’m lucky to have had the opportunity to partner with Jhun on numerous projects at Turing, and continue to learn from him on every one. He has a great ability to dissect logic while focusing on the end goal. It makes me sad to part ways at the end of this module but I am also stoked to see where he goes in his career. My ideal pair-partner in a job is Jhun."
- __Aaron Careaga__

"Jhun has been there for me since day one and Cheek’s first object model talk that left me questioning everything I knew about life.  His calming presence has been a necessary slow down that I need more often than not.  Not only is he an incredible friend, but I have also watched him work his butt off to become a force to be reckoned with in 1508.  I pulled the classic reality tv show approach when I first thought about Turing, “I’m not here to make friends.”  However, Jhun would not have that and I am so giddy to see all of the amazing socially conscious changes that he will make.  His strength in sniffing out problems in code, his work ethic, and his all around positive attitude will take him far in the tech world."
- __Jill Donohue__

"Jhun is great at collaborating. The most interesting thing about Jhun is that he can tackle the assignment that is given to him. That is cool and all. But in retrospect, I would say that his other skills are the ones that shine the most. To the point, Jhun is like the happiest guy I know. This sounds 'meh' but it made a huge difference everytime I work with him and is probably the biggest reason why I choose to work with Jhun.

"Jhun is one of my favorite people I have ever met. He has the ability to light up a room and lift everyone up. On top of that he is a super talented developer and It is very clear he is passionate about this. I am constantly impressed with his work ethic and the challenges he takes on. It is obvious he really pushed himself this module and the results speak for themselves. He is patient and determined — qualities that will make him an invaluable addition to the Turing staff."

### Playing a Part

- I tutored a Module 2 student (Chad Ellison) to better prepare him for his little shop project
- I introduced 2 potential students to Turing (one of the potential students stopped by and me and Jorge gave him a tour of the school)
- I helped TA at the Girls Develop It class at turing for a Saturday. It was an amazing experience!
- I've helped Rachel lead a community night that centered around API's.
- I was named leader of the Berners-Lee posse and we are currently in the lead with posse points (previous to this we were always in last place.)
