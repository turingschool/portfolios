* Rails Syntax & API - 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support
* Rails Style - 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
* Testing - 4: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
* Collaboration - 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when

This was a week long project where Jason, Jill and I built an app to track web traffic.

#### Assessed By: Rachel

#### Notes:

#### Feedback from Peers

* "Amber might be quiet at times, but don't be fooled -she is a force to be reckoned with in the tech industry! Amber is an incredible teacher, a creative mind, and a fabulous mentor for when I felt beyond lost. It was an absolute pleasure!"

* "My life candle is diminishing now that I will no longer be working with her. She makes dreams possible and is an absolute blast. At times I thought to myself, this is what a real developer looks like. Her work ethic is second to none, being the crusher that she is I'm pretty sure we just went over her lines of code for our final project and she had over 100,000 lines which is nuts. I have to say she is awesome, great and kewl and I knew this module was game over once partnered with her. She has a real passion for code, especially the front end. If you see our program you can give Amber major props for the beauty that envelops. Also she is a Broncos fan and that's respectful."

* “Amber was an amazing teammate on Little Shop. Her energy is infectious and only matched by her drive and talent. Her leadership and determination was responsible for us getting off to a great start and giving us time to implement not 2, but 4 extensions. Her front end development skills blossomed on this project and it was a joy to come in every morning and see what new featured she had implemented. I would love love love to work with Amber on any future projects. In fact I wish I could work with her on all future projects."

* "I went into Traffic Spy expecting the worst after hearing multiple upper module students groan about “the punisher."  However, it proved to be the greatest learning experience that I have had at Turing thus far -  greatly in part to having Amber as a partner.   She never made me feel left behind, and was always willing to work through problems with me.  Amber attacks problems head on and I am always impressed with her style and tact.  She is patient, humble, a great teacher, and an even better friend.  I would love to work with her in the future and I cannot wait to see her kick ass in the industry."

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* I have continued to attend Joan Clarke Society meetings
* Participated in Improv Comedy and Meditation Classes

## Review

### Notes


### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.



Notes: 

Tried to focus on design a little more this term and helping other students. Unfortunetly didnt get to help lower module students but did get to do some design. 

 Overall great partner and hard worker. 
 
 Try to take ownership of community a little mroe next module by being at warmups and wrapups
