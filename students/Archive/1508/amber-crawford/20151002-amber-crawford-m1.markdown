### Your Mission

In starting at Turing this module, my main goal was to make sure that I really enjoyed programming in a formal environment and that was a viable career option for me in the long run. I wanted to learn as much as possible while also maintaining a good life balance.  I think that have been successful in this so far, which is really exciting!  I feel so much more comfortable writing code and large programs and empowered to really dive into the developer field and hopefully call it my own. My goals for the next session are to continue working with the same momentum while also beginning to explore the larger tech world.

### End of Module Assessment

Ruby Syntax & API - 4
  Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer

Ruby Style - 3
​ Developer writes code that is easy to follow

Blocks & Enumerations - 4
  ​Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks

Testing - 4
  ​Developer consistently takes small steps, using the tests for both design and verification

Workflow - 4
​ Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

Collaboration - 4
​ Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


### Attendance

I did leave early on Friday, Sep. 11th, for a flight home to attend a family wedding and also missed our Field Day, Sep. 18th, excursion for a doctor's appointment.

## Team

### Projects

Below is a list of group projects from this session...

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/enigma)

For this project we created a program which encrypted and decrypted text using randomized key values.

Evaluation Comments:
* Separate directories for encrypt, decrypt, and crack. Essentially 3 separate projects.
* Some methods not covered in unit testing.
* Some long methods and opportunities for refactoring and consolidating code into slightly
more readable portions.
* Project was fully completed.
* Good testing, covered edge cases in many places.
* Cracking calculated the key, and was not a brute force approach.

Evaluation Score:
Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
Test Driven Development: 3
Functionality: 4

#### Headcount
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

For this project we created a program which parsed public school enrollment and testing data and analyzed it based on set parameters.

Evaluation Score:

* Overall functionality: 4: *Passes the Test Harness (you'll get this later in the project, to discourage you from using the test harness)*
* Enumerables: 4
* Fundamental Ruby - 4: *Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring +1 from influence point*
* TDD - 3: *Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.*
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3: *Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities*



## Community

### Giving Feedback

I try to make a point of reaching out to or working with one of my classmates on every project; while I have not given much formal feedback yet, I think that I have learned a lot and hope that I have been able to give a little back as well.

Here is some feedback that I have sent to my peers:

Emily Dowdle:
"Pairing with Emily on the Headcount project has been one of my most successful pairing experiences at Turing so far. She is collaborative, capable and just plain easy to work with. You can tell that she is really driven to excel here while also prioritizing a work-life balance that I have found incredibly impressive. I looked to her throughout the project as a barometer for our progress and success because she never loses her cool or curiosity for the code. Even when struggling with sections, we managed to keep everything in perspective and actually have some fun with this project! Emily is already an excellent Ruby developer and I hope to work with her again as we move into the coming modules."

Nicole Hall: Nicole was great to work with on our enigma project! She was engaging and helpful and, even when we hit some serious roadblocks, never lost her cool. Her experience, having gone through the module before, was extremely helpful, too - she has made some awesome mentor connections which was key to overcoming some of our biggest hurdles.  I think that we paired together really well and hope to again in Mod. 2!


### Being a Community Member

"Working with Amber has been an absolute joy. She's sharp as a tack and just about as friendly as they come. Whether we paired on a problem or divided work and  came back together to discuss it, Amber was always open to new ideas and taking tangents to experiment with various solutions. Even during stressful moments, she takes time to answer others' questions. I really can't speak more highly of her and I'd welcome the opportunity to work with her again."

"Dearest Amber, Working on enigma with you was a joy.  You are a killer developer and I’m very impressed with how fast you learned Ruby.  When we began any work session, you made an effort to “DTR” and define what our objectives should be, how long we’d work, and what would be completed by the end of the session.  I’ve carried this practice over to my current paired-project.  As I mentioned when we worked together, my last Enigma partner pretty much ‘fired’ me after the second work-day.  I was excluded from the project and my ruby skills suffered because of it.  I truly appreciate how easy it is to work with you.  You never got stressed, even when tests were breaking.  You never panicked even when it took longer than expected.  Your calm demeanor is exactly what is needed to be successful at Turing.  This place can get very stressful and you always manage to rise above it.   Good luck in Module 2!"


### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:
* Attend Joan Clarke society weekly coffee meet-ups
* Stay after classes to help peers with projects and study
* Signed up to help organize 1510 happy hour


## Review

### Notes

* We'd like to see you organize something next module that makes you uncomfortable.

### Outcome

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
