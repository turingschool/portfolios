#### Feedback from Peers

* "I was beyond thrilled when I found out I got to work on the TRELORA project with Amber.  She kept the pace of the project consistently moving forward while also pausing to explain concepts that felt off to me.  She is the dark horse candidate in 1508 who quietly works by herself, but ends up producing one of the top apps from front to back.  I cannot wait to see where she ends up in Pittsburgh and would be honored to work alongside her in the future!"

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* I have continued to attend Joan Clarke Society meetings
* Participated in Turing new Buddy Program with Module 1 studentss
