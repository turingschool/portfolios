# Amber Crawford - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to continue honing my programming skills while also challenging myself to learn a new language and framework... and also to graduate Turing!

### End of Module Assessment

N/A

### Work

This module I completed several individual projects focused on both Javascript and advanced Rails use and integration.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/issues/12)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)

In this project I worked with a team to make performance enhancements on a job scraping application for the school.  Specifically, I completed a research spike into whether Docker would be a good fit for the project and recorded my results.

##### Scores

* Blog Post (40) - Nice work on the post! I think it's valuable to learn and be able to articulate when a technology is cool, but not applicable for a project at the moment!
* Participation (50) - Thanks for participating so much in the PR reviews!
* Risk Taking and Creativity (60) - Good job with reaching out and talking to other mentors on their experiences working with Docker!

#### Thoughtbox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/thoughtbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b#file-simulated-assessment-md)

Practice for final exam incorporating both Rails and Javascript functionality.

##### Scores

* Main Chunk (70) - Application is deployed. All features are complete or some features are complete but developer showed effort to test drive coding the application. Developer worked entirely on their own for the entire application.
* Pass Project (30) - Developer got all 3s or above on the rubric.

#### RealTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/real-time-crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Crowdsourcing app that creates poll while showing real-time results to both administrators and users.

##### Scores

* Concept and Features (75) - Nice work here! I didn't see any additional features beyond the main requirements - but this is a solid first version, for sure!
* Code Quality (25) - Some things I might want to see here would be the existance of a poll object.
* Client-Side Application (25) - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.
* TDD (20) - I'd really like to see unit levels tests here - you have files that would be easy to test in your lib directory - and beyond that, if you refactored out things into poll onjects and pollStorage - you could test some additional logic buried in the server - such as how a poll is created, how a specific poll is found, etc.
* Interface (5) - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* Workflow (4) - 1 point removed for having node_modules committed

## Team Work

### Projects

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

A clone of the classic game snake, written in Javascript, with additional "Party Mode" added.

Final Score: 270

"Amber was a rock star to work with for Game Time. I basically knew that going in, which is why I requested to pair with her, but overall I could not have been happier with how our final project turned out. I had had a hectic intermission and did not do as much of the pre-work as I would've liked (had to head to a funeral out of state), so my JavaScript skills were not where I wanted starting the project. Amber took me under her wing and we paired throughout the project and she regularly took the lead in building out features and debugging major issues. What constantly impressed me was how Amber was always two or three steps ahead of me when pairing - her first hunch was regularly right and it kept our project moving quickly. Amber is the perfect honor roll student here at Turing - she has juggled module 4, job hunting effectively out of state and heading out of the country to Israel for ten days during classes and succeeded. I can't wait to see what she's up to after Turing!"

## Community

### Giving Feedback

“Sekhar was the perfect partner for our GameTime project!  He is a natural leader and really stepped up on this project keeping us on track and thinking about the big picture throughout.  When I would start to stray down an inefficient work-path, he would always be the first to take a step back and ask the important questions to move our work onto a better path.  More than that, he has been an amazing and essential member of the Turing community and I am so happy to have been able to work with him throughout our 4 modules.  Can’t wait to see where he goes next!"

### Being a Community Member

From day one, I always knew that Amber and I were going to be good friends, little did I know that we would become “Jimber.”  Amber is not only one of my closest friends, but also such an incredible part of my entire Turing experience.  Since the beginning, Amber has been such a quiet yet confident influence on me and my work.  Her ability to multitask and motivate herself is unparalleled and sometimes makes me think that she is part robot.  Amber is going to take off in the industry as a female role model, and I am so excited to see where she ends up which is hopefully near me down the road.

### Posse Challenges
#### Ritchie Posse

It was really great to be able to engage with the posse member so consistently this module!  I tried to serve as a good resource to the team both on challenges and projects but our 1510 and 1511 students really stepped up this module driving on the pairing sessions and making sure to include module one students and challenge them to work with the greater team.  Here are links to the specific assignments submitted the first four weeks.
