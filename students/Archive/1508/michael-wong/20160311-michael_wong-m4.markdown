# Michael Wong - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wasn't really sure what to expect going into Module 4. I knew we were going to be learning some javascript and 
making a game and after that people were going to give me money for doing the same thing. My goal was pretty much to
just make it through with my brain intact and reach this promised land.

### Attendance

I was present for all but 2 days.

### Work

## Projects

### Team

I participated in the following team projects:

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlomajor/gametime_js/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Production URL](http://marlomajor.github.io/gametime_js)

This app was a challenge to build a game (for us Space Invaders) in strictly JavaScript.

Team: Michael Wong, Marlo Major

#### Score - 230 / 300

* Function Expectations: 25 / 35 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
* User Interface:        10 / 15 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* Testing:               10 / 30 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* Javascript Style:      20 / 30 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* Workflow:              25 / 25 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* Code Sanitation        10 / 15 - Five or fewer Complaints

### Individual

I participated in the following individual projects:

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/lookingfor)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)
* [Production URL](http://lookingforme.herokuapp.com)

This app was a job scraper for Stack Overflow. It was designed in a way that simulated a real work type environment 
of shared responsibility of code, pull request reviews, and deployment handling among a team.

#### Scores - 160 / 150

* Blog Post:     40 / 40 - Developer has one in depth blog post.
* Participation: 50 / 50 - Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
* Risk Taking:   60 / 60 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/real_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)
* [Production URL](http://real-wong-time.herokuapp.com)

This was a polling app that handled real time client and server side communication using websockets and express.

#### Scores - 120 / 200

Features:     50 / 100 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.
Code Quality: 25 / 30  - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Client Side:  25 / 30  - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.
TDD:          10 / 30  - Many areas of the code are not covered by tests.
Interface      5 / 5   - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
Workflow       5 / 5   - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Final Assessment

### Feedback

Sekhar Paladugu - I've really enjoyed having Mike in 1508 these past two modules. Mike is always smiling and 
regularly makes himself available to help others when they're stuck. I've always thought of Mike as one of the more
curious students at Turing, which is a great quality in a developer. Mike usually digs deeper into understanding 
what's happening in the code and pairing with him gives me new insights into how software works.

Marlo Major - Working with Michael was relieving, to say the least. Starting out in module 4, I felt completely 
overwhelmed by the new information being thrown at me as well as the old information concerning JavaScript I 
still hadn’t learned yet, and Mike was able to calm any situation and help me to realize that I was here to learn, 
not to obsess unnecessarily over minor details. He would ardently write tests I was confused about and explain them 
to me  or find a way to  help our game character do one thing or another and would explain that to me as well. 
GameTime was much less overwhelming because I had Mike’s calm demeanor and sincere desire to learn the material, 
too, on my side. I would work with him again…even though now, it would have to be in a real workplace! In the same 
breath, I would work with Michael at Turing as well as an established company again on a moment’s notice. He’s a 
crucial player to have on any team. I couldn’t have built Space Invaders without him.


### Playing a Part

I don't know that I played an overt part in the community this module simply because I was scrambling to stay afloat
in a sea of JavaScript. I made extra efforts to keep workspaces and the coffee area clean (and make coffee when 
possible/necessary), walkways clear, and not just do those things when it was 'my turn.' I would also try to chime 
in if I caught people from any module trying to solve a problem I either knew how to solve, or at least wasn't clueless
about. I did try to coordinate with ChelJo and others to plan another LAN party but thought it better to let the 
torch be passed on.
