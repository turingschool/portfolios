# Michael Wong - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My learning goals for this Module were to improve my general understandings of Rails and API consumption, more practice with the "secret handshake" of token authentication, and becoming more comfortable with working in both development and production environments.

### Attendance

I was absent 2 days and late on one day.

### Work

## Projects

### Team

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)
* [Production URL](http://adventurous-abodes.herokuapp.com/)

This project was designed for us to practice transforming an app from a single shop to a multi-tenant app. We were expected to implement new features without excessively deleting code.

Team: Shannon Paige, Michael Wong, Matt Sternjolm, Nicole Hall

Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

#### Notes

Good UI experience, but had issue with crashes on small parts of app. Also when you inactivated a renter's profile you could still go to their property page.

#### Notes

Some mislabeling in the production interface. Overall - all content there.

Contribution model had conditional for testing, not ideal, but understandable. Views are exceptionally well refactored - great partials. Very solid MVC and use of service.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/rails_engine_2)

This project was designed to test my ability to fetch data from an external API and use it within an app. It was also a test of our ability to turn user stories into features.

## Community

### Feedback

Matt Sternjolm - Mike was very helpful both as a teammate on the Pivot and also as a resource for advice throughout Module 3. He's always looking to lend a hand and did a great job helping out with his prior knowledge of the curriculum

### Playing a Part

I don't feel as though I played a large role in the community this time since I was so focused on making sure I passed the second time around.
