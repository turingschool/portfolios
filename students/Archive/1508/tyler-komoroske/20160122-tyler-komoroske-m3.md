# Tyler Komoroske - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During this module, my main focus was was to hone my skills as a developer. I
felt like the first two modules gave me the tools I needed to be successful
and my goal throughout the module was to fine tune those skills. Overall,
I feel like this module was very successful for me and I feel very comfortable
calling myself a developer at this point in the program .

* Feedback from Slota:
* We spent hours coding together and I have never learned so much on a project before, we stayed up an entire night putting our code together because that’s how much he cares about his skills here at Turing. He’s easy to get along with and a dedicated software developer.

### Giving Feedback

* I always gave actionable and useful feedback to all classmates when asked or given the opportunity.

### Playing a Part

* During this module, I tried to extend as much help as I possibly could to my classmates and it was very enjoyable for me. I was able to help my classmates understand some abstract concepts and at the same time, I was able to reinforce my own learning. I consistently offered help to my classmates during the evenings and tried to make sure I was explaining concepts that made sense to my classmates who asked me for help. Overall, this module was an extremely rewarding experience.
