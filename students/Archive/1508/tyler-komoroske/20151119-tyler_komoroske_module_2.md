# Tyler Komoroske - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module focused on learning the Rails framework. Prior to this module, I had never worked with Rails.
I feel like I really learned a ton in short period of time, and by the end of the module I was actually able
to build a pretty cool website using Rails.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Mike Dao and
here are the  
results:

## Scores

Started with test.
Began the test by creating teachers. Knew to hit the schema to find out what it required to create.
Wrote tests in a way that order of creation of students would mess with display if not implemented correctly.
Initially stored age as a string.
Could follow error messages and how to solve them.
Used foreign key to link students to teacher.
Knew mystring was a result of fixtures.

From Pat:
I had a lot of fun working with Tyler on Traffic Spy.  He’s got a really solid foundation in Ruby, and he helped remove road blocks we ran into throughout the course of the project.  He’s a great teammate, and he kept our group work sessions fun and light.  I look forward to working with him again in the future.

#### Idea Box

Feedback from John Slota:

Tyler was an unbelievable fun and awesome partner.  Working with him really solidified my learning as he was able to explain at many junctions throughout the project what we had to do and why we had to get it done. He was also a fearless leader. At one point during our project, we had the choice to hang out with our cohort members or go work more on our project. Due to Tyler’s love of coding and strong work ethic he pushed us to get back to school and work hard. It was an honor to work with such a great guy and he is so approachable, one of the most important links for learning in 1508.

### Feedback to me

Feedback from Ross:

Tyler was awesome during our little shop project. He was dedicated and motivated the entire time. His ideas were always helpful and insightful, and pushed the progress of the project even further. I think that in order to improve group workflow, Tyler could work on his own workflow process. At one point, there were several issues checked out on waffle under his name. I also encourage him to work on his keyboard shortcuts :smile: Overall, I would definitely enjoy working with Tyler in the future.

Feedback from Robbie:

Tyler was a joy to work with on this project. He has an awesome work ethic and put in the time and effort to deliver a polished product. Tyler has a solid understanding of rails and ruby and he was always willing to keep on working and keep the group on track. I look forward to working with Tyler again in the future.

### Giving Feedback

Ross Edfort:

Ross was a excellent partner to work with on little shop. He was a very hard worker and was consistently trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of deadlines. He was definitely committed to turing in an above average finished product. He also took constantly took initiative to implement features on his own. As for areas of improvement, sometimes I would say things and Ross did not acknowledge that I had even said anything. I think this was just a product of his own concentration, and he definitely was not intentionally ignoring me. This sort of make me feel stupid at times for mentioning my idea. Overall, Ross is great teammate and would definitely enjoy working with him again.
Jeff:

Pat Wey:

Pat really crushed this project. Since it was the first week in module 2, everything was extremely unfamiliar and the error messages did not make a whole lot of sense. Pat was able to troubleshoot these errors pretty consistently and kept us on track to meet deadlines. Pat was also an excellent teammate, and an awesome communicator.  It would be awesome to have an opportunity to work with him in the future.

Robbie Lane:

Robbie was an awesome teammate. He is extremely talented in all aspects of website development. Our project workflow was awesome, and there was essentially no stress throughout the entire project. Robbie constantly had solutions to almost every problem we ran into. The only area for improvement would be group communication. Sometimes I would mention a possible idea or solution, and I wouldn't get any feedback and that kind of made me feel like what I had suggested was stupid. I'm pretty sure that this was actually just a product of Robbie being really focused on whatever he had going on in his own head. I'm sure he was not just intentionally ignoring me, just something to be aware of in the future. Overall, Robbie was a great teammate and I would love to have an opportunity to work with him in the future.

### Playing a Part

* I helped hang two of the new TV's with Ross and Robbie
* I did the dished twice during this module
* I always try to keep things light and fun, which I think positively contribute to the
overall quality of life here at Turing.
