## Individual

### Your Mission

From both the programming and community side of things, I entered this module determined to carry a positive attitude, and more importantly, a growth mindset, throughout. I think I did pretty well with this last module, but due to lacking confidence and lots of feeling stuck, sometimes I didn't voice my ideas strongly enough and frustration around that led to my bringing a more negative attitude and fixed mindset to my Sales Engine partnership than I would have liked. I'm learning that the rest of my life in programming will be a continual roller coaster of feeling stuck and persevering to get unstuck. I want to be better about embracing the stuckness and staying positive with my team to get through. I think this will be an asset to both me and my community.
Academically, I am excited about front end, but want to not get sucked into that. I want to push myself to tackle challenging code within my group, and accept that even I'm not the strongest coder in my group, we all have something to learn from each other.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Friday, Sept. 25th when I was sick. I am consistently on time and ready to help my posse with warm-up every day.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Web Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/web_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html)

This project was my introduction to Sinatra, which I used to build a number guessing game.

#### Task Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/task_manager)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/task_manager.markdown)

In this project, I used Sinatra to build an application to manage tasks.

#### Personal Web Page

* [GitHub URL](http://mbburch.github.io/)

This project was my introduction to HTML and CSS. It's a work in progress.

#### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

In this project, I created a basic blogging template and started to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails. The CSS file for this project was pre-prepared, as front-end work was not the goal of this project.

#### Contact Manager

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/contact_manager)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html)

In this project, I built an app to manage contacts' emails and phone numbers. This was one of my first experiences with joining tables and using polymorphic relationships, as well as my first time deploying to Heroku.

#### MyJams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/1507-my-jams)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/1507-my-jams)

In this project, I practiced adding authentication and authorization to an app.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

In this project, I used Rails, a database schema design, authentication, and authorization to create an app to record ideas.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### TrafficSpy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

I volunteered to be team lead and pushed myself in that role. I had quieter group members, and this was a way for me to try different styles of leadership. I really focused on staying positive and facilitating good group communication.  I led our feedback process post-project and tried to push my teammates to share. Although I struggled to feel like I was able to be a strong coder on this project, I asked lots of questions to further my understanding and tried not to get sucked into just doing front-end.

My group received the following feedback and scores:

* Good pulling out of things into partials
* Methods in controller were a little heavy and could stand to be refactored
* Good use of helper classes
* More logic could be pushed to the models
* Design was pleasant
* JSon works, and campaigns work
* 38 tests

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3

The notes I took for our group discussion can be found here: [Group Notes URL](https://gist.github.com/mbburch/42a2d75608c63fd9d619)

One of my partners said: "While MB was struggling with understanding all the processes of Sinatra mixed with ActiveRecord, she was keen to learn each part and asked many questions.
She felt bad about asking so many questions towards the end when we starting being pressed for time and I wish I could have thought to find a way to encourage her to continue asking since my goal of this project was for everyone to learn what they could in order to help prepare for the next project.
But even without asking as many questions, she was still attentive and was a good pairing partner. She could drive and listen to a navigator still and learn some from that experience as well.
I was having difficulty communicating when I started getting into areas where I was having trouble working out what I wanted to code. MB came up with a good idea of me just handing over the keyboard during such times and force me to talk through my thought process. I liked this idea and felt it worked well for the scope of our project. I look forward to implementing this strategy in the future."

#### Little Shop of Orders (Denvestments)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/denvestments)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

My group and I built an online local micro-lending platform. Borrowers can view and contribute to local community members seeking loans to start small business ventures. I felt like I was able to be a much stronger contributing member to this group compared to TrafficSpy. I'm enjoying TDD and getting better at rspec. Although I was not the team lead, and tried to encourage our leader to step into that role, I ended up taking on some of the leadership, particularly around communication and goal setting. This may be my favorite group experience to date at Turing, as I feel like we communicated pretty well and paired well together. I think we were particularly successful around workflow. I feel like I really kept in mind the feedback I got last module, and that helped me enjoy this experience more.

We received the following feedback and scores:

* Good use of jQuery.
* Some user flow could be better, needs some UX enhancements on the admin dashboard side.
* 60 tests
* 100% test coverage
* Well written tests

* Feature Completeness: 3
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 4
* Testing: 4
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 4

Partner Feedback:
* You were a pleasure to work with. You're competent and communicative while pairing, and you were always willing to help with roadblocks that I would hit, as well as keep the group on track and organize what still needed to work on. I really appreciated all the work you put in. It was really great to wake up to a pull request from you after I thought we were all done for the day; that's something I can really learn from, just taking initiative like that. The only criticism I can offer is that you would get kind of frustrated if something wasn't working, and I think you might have the same problem I do where you want to figure it out for yourself instead of asking for help sooner. Anyway, it was a great experience working with you!

* It was cool to be on a team with you since we didn't really "hang out" any before this project. I always enjoyed that you understood math-speak. Maybe it's just my personality type, but I find myself wishing you were a bit more assertive. It seems like you reserve your suggestions until too late and they becomes complaints, but I thought everything you had to say was valuable. I guess I should also work to come off as less intimidating. You definitely worked hard and did your part on the team. I'm interested to see what you do when you get out of turing.

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I volunteered to help host the Women Who Code Ruby study group.
* I am excited to help out with Kids Who Code. I've gone once so far, and have met with George to talk about curriculum and planning.
* I signed up for the young entrepreneurs gatherings next module, and am really looking forward to it.
* I've tried, as of yet unsuccessfully, to get people out of the building and exercising with me at lunch. Hoping to get this rolling as the days get darker for sure!
* I pitch in to keep our space clean by picking up dishes, running the dishwasher, and cleaning up after Friday breakfasts and after others.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I've started trying to organize a posse gathering outside of school with mentors and have a little interest, but need to follow through.
