### Your Mission

I had intended to get a mentor since the begininng of module one, however
due to the usual work that never seems to end, never prioritized it. On
the first day of the module I organized a weekly mentor and the sessions
I have had are very beneficial.

### Attendance

I missed 1 friday of the module do to bad roads caused by snow.any days of the module.
Never showed up late or left early.

## Team

### Projects

#### The Pivot (PivotProduce / Farmers Market)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/the_pivot.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

I worked with Emily, John and Justin for this project, and initially we had a hard start,
but after we got used to everyone's work style, we were able to focus on having fun
learning which led to better-than-expected results.

##### Evaluation Comments

* 96% coverage and really good feature tests. Could use more model tests.
Really good use of POROs. Over use of helpers in controllers, should be moved to helpers directory.
Nice attempt at moving that logic out of the views though.
UI was really intuitive and looked good, but the seed file was not implimented to the extent required so it could have been painful if it was.
Some items didn't link to muti-tenant url structure. Adding store appeared to be successful,
but didn't work on the side of the user made as an admin.

##### Scores
* Completion: 2.5 ** talk to josh
* Organization: 4
* User experience: 3
* TDD: 3+
* Code Quality: 3+

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* “I had the pleasure to work with Emily during the pivot this module, and she was voted to take a difficult role as project manager,
of which she performed very well and drove us though some difficult organizational issues successfully.
I admire how focused and dedicated to the project she is, and is always willing to pair & repair a difficult code problem.
Her technical skills are impressive, and I appreciate how approachable she makes herself for collaboration."

### Being a Community Member

* "As always, Jason is capable and reliable. He’s a joy to work with. If he doesn’t know how to approach something, he figures it out.
He’s open to feedback but will push back (in the best way) when he believes in something.
His independent thinking and hard work carried us far in a difficult project." -Emily Dowdle

* "Jason is a team player first and foremost, I thoroughly enjoyed working with him as he took time out to help guide me on issues I wasn’t clear on,
and additionally was a fun partner to pair with. His technical know how is unmatched within our module, and he pushes himself as evidenced by his usage of vim.
He was the glue of the team so to speak as he made sure those of us at school took time out to make sure we were eating, which led to bonding sessions that made us work super well together.
He’s patient, smart and a great asset for a project. His humor is awesome too, it takes the edge off of projects when things look dire." - John Slota

* “Jason was a great team member during the pivot project.  He is well organized in thought and work practices which is an place I am weak so the complimentary qualities was great to have.
He is a strong coder and a good guy to work with." - Justin Pease
