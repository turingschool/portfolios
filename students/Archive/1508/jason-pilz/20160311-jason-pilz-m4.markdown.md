# Jason Pilz - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* Besides the typical goal of trying to absorb as much JS-related instruction,
I also planned to start getting out and meeting people at meetups. I was able to
attend Denver.rb, creative technologists at ModeSet and Denver Ember. Can't wait
to go to some more! Also focused on making my resume / cover letter as good as
possible by leveraging the knowledge of Ian Douglas.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

This module I worked on 4 projects, 2 solo and 2 paired. I felt the learning
goals were very diverse across these projects, none of them really shared the
same structure / frameworks which increased the breadth of technologies I was
able to be exposed to.

#### IdeaBox 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/idea-box-js)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

###### Description
* In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and
archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

###### Comments
* Really complete project. Use of ES6 features. More consistency needed.
Strong functionality. Client-side testing needed.

###### Scores
* Specification Adherence - 10 points
* User Interface - 5 points
* Testing - 8 points
* Ruby on Rails quality - 10 points
* JavaScript Style - 8 points
* Workflow - 10 points

**Overall Points**: 156

#### RealTime (Crowdsource)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

###### Description
* In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build
real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information,
it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

###### Comments
* Really knocked this one out of the park! Good job on testing, writing out clean
code and adding a really nice additional feature that captures the spirit of what
a user would want this app to do for them. As we discussed, refactoring out a
pollStorage that is a layer used to talk to your 'database' would probably be the
next step here.

###### Scores

* Features - 100 points
* Code Quality - 30 points
* Client-side Application - 30 points
* Test-Driven Development - 30 points
* Interface - 5 points
* Workflow - 5 points  

**Overall Points**: 200

## Team

### Projects

I worked with Ryan Johnson on GameTime, where we built a replica of the game, Pong.
This was a challenging project and resulted in good learning about JavaScript objects.
The second project was paired with Emily Dowdle, we used Ember and Electron to
create a native desktop application that reads/writes notes to the filesystem.

#### GameTime (Pong)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

###### Description
* Build a replica of Pong that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component
for this project. Used client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

##### Ryan Johnson
* I had the privilege of working with Ryan during our GameTime project, he proved
himself to be extremely dedicated and resourceful in achieving our project goals.
His attitude and work ethic made pairing very easy and enjoyable, he's always
willing to try a different approach or idea. I was able to increase my skill as
a developer because of the interactions during this and many other projects
working with Ryan. He's a legend and I can't wait to team-up on a project again.

##### Adam Jensen
* It has been a pleasure working with Adam this module. His enthusiasm and desire
to push the knowledge boundaries encourages me to do the same. He is always
willing to collaborate and help anyone who needs it. I look forward to pairing
with him in the future, because we both know, VIM-ter is coming!

##### Aaron Careaga
* I have been able to witness Aaron’s incredible growth as a developer over the
last 7 months. The technical skills he has developed are extremely impressive and
his soft skills couldn’t be any better, I always look forward to collaborating
with him for various reasons. First, he is always willing to try any approach,
but doesn’t lose sight of the project goals at any time. Secondly, his personality
makes it very enjoyable to solve challenging problems together without getting
discouraged. I would highly recommend Aaron to anyone!

##### Emily Dowdle
* I have been privileged to work on multiple projects with Emily. Time after time,
she consistently demonstrates her strong technical ability, natural leadership skills,
and positive attitude, all while tackling any challenge she is tasked with. I
respect her dedication to continually push herself to always improve and take on
harder and harder challenges….and share the successful outcome with others. Any
employer would be lucky to have a developer like Emily on their team!

##### Torie Warren
* Our cohort would not have been the same without Torie. She is one of my main
'go to' people when I am stuck and need advice. I was lucky that I was placed in
the same posse as Torie, which has been great for my learning being able to work
together solving random daily challenges with her. I appreciate her calm and
confident attitude under stress, which rubs off and positively affect the people
around her. Her technical abilities always impress me and her drive to push the
boundaries encourage me to do the same. It's been great 7 months getting to know
Torie and look forward to work together in the future.

##### Pat Wey
* Just like in his previous hockey career, Pat is the MVP of our cohort. I've been
able to level up in numerous ways by working with him on a variety of projects.
He always suggests an unconventional yet extremely effective approach to solving any
given problem. Not only is he a superstar coder, but has the personality to match.
I would not think twice about teaming up with Pat during the most important of
projects, and hope I get the chance again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

* "shout out to @jasonpilz and @ryanj for a sweet digital ocean session" - Marina Corona
* "Jason Pilz is a great developer. Period. I’ve worked with him numerous times
over the last three modules and I have zero hesitation in recommending him for,
anything. He’s one of the hardest workers in our module and is extremely reliable.
On top of all that, he’s a great programmer. His natural curiosity lends him,
motivation to discover and explore new skills — even leading multiple electives,
with Ryan on DevOps. I can’t speak highly enough of Jason or his work ethic." - Emily Dowdle
* "It has been an honor working with Jason during module 4. I was fortunate enough
to work with him on our GameTime project and it was a pleasure. His wide knowledge
base of everything software and his willingness to share what he learns with me
has definitely been priceless. He has the ability to make complicated issues very
simple has helped me grow as a developer and I am definitely looking forward to
working with him with future projects!" - Ryan Johnson
* "Jason is modest about what he knows, and so willing to share it. I’ve learned
so many neat tricks from him that have improved my workflow. He’s always seeking
out new tools and I really respect his desire to learn about and share them with
the rest of us. He’s definitely made the rest of us better by pushing those
learning limits." - Torie Joy Warren
* "Jason is not only a brilliant developer but also a good friend. He continues
to amaze me with his insight on topics I thought I understood. Watching him grow
across our relationship has been inspiring, and pushes me to better my knowledge.
Although we have paired on various challenges, I unfortunately did not have the
opportunity to work on a project with Jason. It is one of my biggest missed
opportunities at Turing." - Aaron Careaga
* "Jason has been a pleasure to have in this cohort. I've learned a lot about
humility, honesty and hard work by working alongside him throughout the past 6
months. Technically speaking, I'm most impressed by his curiosity and his
fearlessness when it comes to tackling hairy technical problems. He's applied
this to his interest in DevOps, and he's emerged as the go-to human for DevOps
questions in our cohort. As a Canadian hockey player might say, he’s a legend
and a beauty." - Pay Wey

### Playing a Part

* Worked with Horace to create a script using the DigitalOcean API to automate
the creation of new droplets for students interested in attending DevOps / VPS
sessions. (PR to Turing/scripts repo coming soon!)
* Organized and hosted multiple DevOps sessions, worked with many students to
get them set up with a VPS from the ground up.
* Helped multiple prospective students I met at the building entrance, introduced
myself and walked then to the person they were trying to find.
