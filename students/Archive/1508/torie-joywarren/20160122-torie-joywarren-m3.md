#### Personal Project (Gluscription)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md#learning-goals)

The peronal project was a 2 week, self-guided project where I built a web app
to tell users whether or not a medication is safe for people with celiacs.
It was evaluted by Tess.

##### Evaluation Comments:

##### Scores:

Completion: 4  
Organization: 3  
TDD: 4  
Code Quality: 3  
User Experience: 3.5  
Performance: 4  

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Rails Engine was a one week, individual project, where I built an API.
It was evaluated by Josh Mejia.

##### Evaluation Comments:  

Really solid project. Great testing. Some queries could have been better, however there's a clear trajectory of improvement. Several queries were really clean and showed an understanding of advanced AR concepts

##### Scores:

Completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.  
TDD: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.  
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.  
API Design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.  
Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

API Curious was a one week, individual project, where I built a twitter clone.
It was evaluated by Horace.

##### Evaluation Comments:  

* solid implementation of base spec and some extra pagination for flavor
* uses VCR to wrap up test integrations with the twitter data
* uses a service object and our own trimmed-down open-structs to represent tweet data
* keep an eye on method names -- check_for_updates should actually check something

##### Scores:

Completion: 3 - Developer delivered all planned features.  
Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.  
TDD: 4 - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.  
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.  
User Experience: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.  
#### THE PIVOT

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot was a two week, group project, where we pivoted a snow gear store into
an uber for car rental (Borrow-my-Carro).
It was evaluated by Josh Mejia and Andrew.

##### Evaluation Comments:  

Design looked really good. Some minor UI issues. Car didn't show in category when added by "store". Paperclip didn't work correctly. Multi-tenancy looked good. Base expectations mostly there.

##### Scores:

Completion: 2.5  
Organization: 3  
User Experience: 3  
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).  
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.  

## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Working with Marlo is a great experience. He keeps the mood light, while also being hyper aware of how everyone is doing individually and being considerate of everyone. He constantly iterates on what works and scraps what doesn’t, and is always seeking feedback. This makes him motivating to work with, and someone I respect immensely. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with Marlo again."

"Being in Kay has been great, and I attribute a lot of that to the enthusiasm that Dave (even as a mod 4 student) puts into it. He’s been excited to help any of us with our projects and really encourages us to value learning for the sake of learning. One thing for Dave to work on is implementing more of his ideas. I thought he had some really great ideas for improving posse/warm ups and would love to see them happen."

### Being a Community Member

"Tori is very enthusiastic about life in general, and it rubs off in a very positive way with the posse. She regularly corrals the group for outings and encourages participation during warm ups. She also enjoys learning new concepts, such as elixir. She spearheaded an elixir warmup which was very informative. To improve, Tori should have more faith in her abilities as a programmer and take the initiative to teach others and take charge of warmups more often. She has the chops for it."

### Playing a Part

* Participated in buddy program
* Organized 2 Kay posse happy hours
