## Community

### Giving Feedback

"You are a much better developer than you give yourself credit for. You have a knack for asking the right questions and looking in the right places when something goes wrong, which makes you a great debugger. Your sense of humour makes working with you really enjoyable - I would be happy to work with you in the future :)"

"Your organizational skills and calmness make working with you really easy. I also really enjoyed your drive to figure things out. You've got a lot of great ideas and I would definitely enjoy working with you again."

### Being a Community Member

"You were very easy to work with and brought a lot of good ideas and techniques to the table. I definitely learned some new things working with you. You rock!"

"It makes sense that your name is Joy-Warren because you are a JOY to work with.  You helped me so much during the Little Shop project.  You helped me to strengthen my skills and to learn HAML.  You were so patient while pointing out where I had made errors and helping me fix them.  You were very understanding when I needed to take a break from the project to study for my assessment retake.  You also helped me prep for the retake which was super generous of you.  I can’t wait to see where you go after Turing.  You are already and incredible developer and when you find a job, you’ll be a tremendous asset to your fellow devs."

"It was a pleasure working with you on GlobalPursuit. You’re ability to break down logic into manageable pieces is great. I really enjoyed how you brought a positive attitude and patient demeanor to the group. Hope to work together again in the future."
