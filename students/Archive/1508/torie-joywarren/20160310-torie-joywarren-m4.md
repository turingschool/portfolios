#### RealTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/toriejw/real-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

This was a six day project where I built an application allowing users to create and vote in polls using web sockets.

Score: 185/200

Comments:  

Good use of separation of concerns. Functionality exceeded expectations. Added functionality to reopen poll. Tests for models and server. Integration tests missing. Recommended to maintain the same level of abstraction when dealing with event listeners.

Point breakdown:

- Concept and Features

  100 points - Exceeded expectations. There are more features than we planned.

- Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

  25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

- Client-Side Application

  25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

- Test-Driven Development

  25 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.


## Team

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This was a 10 day pair project with Pat. We built slime volleyball, which is a two player game modeled after volleyball.

Score: 285/300

- Functional Expectations

  35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

- User Interface

  10 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

- Testing

  25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

- JavaScript Style

  25 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

- Workflow

  25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

- Code Sanitation

  The output from JSHint shows… 15 points - Zero complaints

#### ScaleUp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)
* [Original Assignment]()

This was a four day team project. We took on the role of a consultancy and had daily stand ups, submitted PRs to be reviewed, etc. We worked on a website that scrapes job postings and lists them in one place.

Score: 160/150

- Blog Post (40 Points)

  Good call on writing the post on the actual scaling lesson!

- 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for Looking For or has one in depth blog post.
Participation (50 points)

- 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

- 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.


## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Jill is smart as hell and amazingly supportive. She’s been such a key part of our cohort cohesion. I’ve learned a lot from her design and cover letter skills and she’s helped keep me sane by reminding me that it’s okay to go hiking on weekends and that having a life (even while at Turing) is a good thing. She’s been a really positive influence on 1508 both academically and socially."

"Oh Sekhar. He knows when to ask for help, and he’s always willing to give it. If he can’t help, he always knows what or whose direction to point you in. He’s been key to the cohesion of 1508 and is incredibly inclusive. He will make Turing proud in the real world."

"Jason is modest about what he knows, and so willing to share it with you. I’ve learned so many neat tricks from him that have improved my workflow. He’s always seeking out new tools and I really respect his desire to learn about and share them with the rest of us. He’s definitely made the rest of us better by pushing those learning limits."

"Working with Pat on GameTime was a pleasure. He was incredibly motivated the whole time and is a strong developer. He pushed me to work my hardest and helped me stay motivated. I would be thrilled to have him as a co-worker, because he does an incredible job with any challenge and is a lot of fun to work with."

### Being a Community Member

"I am so happy that I have gotten to know Torie on a much deeper level this module.  She is a silent force in our cohort, and I look forward to coding with such grace and to be quite honest - speed - one day.  She has been supportive not only in the classroom, but also whenever I was feeling down.  I am astounded by her talent and can’t wait to see how her journey to Seattle goes.  It is nice to know that I will have such an amazing friend up in the Pacific NW!"

"Our cohort would not have been the same without Torie. She is one of my main
'go to' people when I am stuck and need advice. I was lucky that I was placed in
the same posse as Torie, which has been great for my learning being able to work
together solving random daily challenges with her. I appreciate her calm and
confident attitude under stress, which rubs off and positively affect the people
around her. Her technical abilities always impress me and her drive to push the
boundaries encourage me to do the same. It's been great 7 months getting to know
Torie and look forward to work together in the future."

"Torie has been a pleasure to have as a classmate the past seven months. Her dedication to learning and her natural programming ability have made her a great resource for everyone in 1508 and at Turing more broadly. I've been inspired by Torie's ability to figure out concepts on her own and really just focus/get in the flow of working self-sufficiently. In 1508 Torie is one of the students everyone looks up to and tries to emulate as a model developer. I have no doubt Torie will make Turing proud as an alum :)"

"Working with Torie on Slime Volleyball was great.  She was really effective in helping to manage the project on a big picture level, and kept me from spending the entire two weeks thinking about ball physics. Her commitment to code quality and design is special and had a noticeable effect in every area of our project.  Her high standards pushed me to be at my best, and resulted in some of the best code I've written/paired on since I've been at school. She's an incredible developer."
