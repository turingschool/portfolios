# Emily Dowdle - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

**M2 Update:** I want to continue to push myself beyond Turing's expectations and pursue my own projects.

**Original:** I came to Turing to learn.

I like to read about business culture and, when appropriate, apply the same methods to my own life. VCs talk a lot about the 10X return. **My goal for Turing is to leave with 10X the knowledge I walked in the door with.**

My growth and performance throughout the module has proved to me that I am well on my way to accomplishing that goal.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Sekhar Paladugu: "Sekhar is an excellent team member. He is kind, respectful and truly cares about those around him. On top of that, he's a talented developer and often approaches problems from a different perspective than my own. I am better for having worked with him and I greatly hope to work with him again."

Jason Pilz: "Jason is a skilled developer and his work ethic is unmatched. He will keep at a problem until it's fixed and always comes through on his promises. Sticker Shop was a true collaboration and I hope to work with Jason in the future."

### Being a Community Member

“Emily was an inspiration to me during our little shop project. She always **stayed focused and dedicated to the task at hand** and kept a close eye on the overall picture of our project status and direction. **Whenever there was a technical issue come up, she was always able to solve the problem.** I was able to learn a ton from her, and I look up to her skill level and attitude. I feel grateful I had the opportunity to work with her on this project and can only hope I get the chance to again in the future.” — Jason Pilz

"Emily has been a wonderful partner to work with. **She is diligent, self-sufficient and yet asks for help when she needs it.** Every time I wanted to pair with Emily she'd find a stopping place and jump on whatever problem I needed assistance with. **I'm impressed with how willing Emily is to seek out new knowledge on her own**, whether through reading documentation or other posts online, or asking fellow developers for help. She also has strong habits for collaborating and remote work, regularly updating Jason and me on her progress, any roadblocks, and checking in about group expectations. **With her guidance my team learned a lot about GitHub these past two weeks.** Overall Emily has been a great partner to work with, and I look forward to working with her again soon." — Sekhar Paladugu

### Playing a Part

* Attended Cloud Foundry meetup on November 12 on Continuous Integration at Allstate
