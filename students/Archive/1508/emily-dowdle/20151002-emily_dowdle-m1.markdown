# Emily Dowdle - M1 Portfolio

### Your Mission

I came to Turing to learn.

I like to read about business culture and, when appropriate, apply the same methods to my own life. VCs talk a lot about the 10X return. **My goal for Turing is to leave with 10X the knowledge I walked in the door with.**

My growth and performance throughout the module has proved to me that I am well on my way to accomplishing that goal.

### End of Module Assessment

**Real-world data collection and analysis.** Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

Assessed By: Tess

#### Notes:

* Implement private methods
* Create setup in test files

#### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Enumerables: 4

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

**Encryption/decryption machine.** Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Application was well tested, covered some edge cases, but was weak in unit testing.
* Some tests were skipped, and one test hung.
* Code was well written using the model of sending messages as opposed to manipulating
instance variables.
* Some minor opportunities to refactor.
* Some complicated enumerable using methods that used #each and #each_with_index
could be refactored to take advantage of best-use enumerables.
* Encrypt/Decrypt can be refactored to use the same class, as well as a portion of the crack method.

#### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

Notes:

* 27 tests, all passing

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Number of failing tests
* File IO should be broken out to its own class.
* Could use some better unit tests with edge cases and sad path tests

#### Scores:

* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Amber Crawford: "Working with Amber has been an absolute joy. She's sharp as a tack and just about as friendly as they come. Whether we paired on a problem or divided work and  came back together to discuss it, Amber was always open to new ideas and taking tangents to experiment with various solutions. Even during stressful moments, she takes time to answer others' questions. I really can't speak more highly of her and I'd welcome the opportunity to work with her again."

Jill Donohue: "Jill is an excellent communicator whose strength is knowing how to diplomatically convey difficult topics. I believe Jill has the potential to be an excellent developer. Her greatest challenge is her own self-doubt. If she devoted the energy she spends doubting her abilities to programming, she would quickly outpace many of the students around her. Jill cares deeply about her peers and works tirelessly to help those around her work through challenges, allowing them to achieve more than they would have alone. I struggle to think and speak at the same time — especially about programming — and in the week we worked together, Jill never rushed or interrupted me. I am a better developer because I have worked with her."

Aaron Careaga: "Pair programming with Aaron lacked many of the roadblocks I’ve experienced with other pairs. We decided to take five minutes to individually experiment with ideas in IRB and then came together to recursively create a custom method equal to .flatten. Aaron’s positive attitude made him a joy to work with and his logical insights filled the gaps in my own thinking, allowing us to efficiently develop a solution."

### Being a Community Member

"Pairing with Emily on the Headcount project has been one of my most successful pairing experiences at Turing so far. **She is collaborative, capable and just plain easy to work with.** You can tell that she is really driven to excel here while also prioritizing a work-life balance that I have found incredibly impressive. **I looked to her throughout the project as a barometer for our progress and success because she never loses her cool or curiosity for the code.** Even when struggling with sections, we managed to keep everything in perspective and actually have some fun with this project! Emily is already an excellent Ruby developer and I hope to work with her again as we move into the coming modules." --Amber Crawford

“**Emily’s greatest strength is her ability to come across problems and attack them until she finds a solution.** I was astonished by her ability to persevere even during the most frustrating parts of Enigma. She eloquently writes code and translates this skill into her project design seamlessly. The only time I ever witnessed her stumble was explaining her code to me as she was used to fluidly incorporating it into her file. **Wonderful person to work with who cares not only for the project, but also for her partner’s well-being.**" --Jill Donohue

"I really enjoyed pairing with Emily. **She communicates effectively and maintains a positive attitude while working on problems.** We were able to get on the same page and talk through hurdles as encountered. Her logical reasoning helped me better understand the structure of our code and refactor methods once  functional. I hope to pair together again on future projects." --Aaron Careaga

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Boulder Ruby Meetup on September 16, 2015 to see Andrew Carmer speak.
* Regularly attended Joan Clarke Society morning coffee meetups.
* Joined 3 Lovelace posse lunches.
* Meet with Rolen Le every Wednesday evening for an hour.
* Provide moral support/technical advice when needed.




## Review
