# Emily Dowdle - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

**M3 Update:** I'm working on staying calm and working through problems methodically.

**M2 Update:** I want to continue to push myself beyond Turing's expectations and pursue my own projects.

I came to Turing to learn.

I like to read about business culture and, when appropriate, apply the same methods to my own life. VCs talk a lot about the 10X return. **My goal for Turing is to leave with 10X the knowledge I walked in the door with.**

My growth and performance throughout the module has proved to me that I am well on my way to accomplishing that goal.


### Attendance

I was absent Thursday, December 17 and Friday, December 18.

### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 3.

#### Personal Project: LactationStation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/lactation-station)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md#learning-goals)

**Resource for breastfeeding moms to find out which medications are safe for their
babies.** I used two APIs: OpenFDA, to pull information about specific medications and Twitter, to populate an interactive profile page for users. I also pulled data from LactMed, an NIH database, and built my own API with their data, implementing Ajax calls
to speed up searches.

Assessed By: Tess

##### Notes:

* Great project.
* Impressed that all features were added, even stretch goals.
* Welcome page photo too large, pushes content below the fold.
* Refactor Ajax on index page to iterate over letters for anonymous functions.

##### Scores:

*Feature Delivery*

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 3

*Technical Quality*

* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 3

*Product Experience*

* User Experience: 4
* Performance: 4


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](github.com/emilydowdle/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

**Built an API.** Used complex ActiveRecord queries to retrieve data.

Assessed By: Andrew

##### Notes:

* Great queries but did reach for some ruby.
* Good code quality. Overall a good project.
* The tests were really good. To be perfect there would be more tests for find and find_all etc, but there were good unit and controller tests.

##### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3.5


#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/SweeterTweeter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

**Twitter clone** Used the Twitter gem to pull data from the Twitter API and create a "sweeter tweeter".

Assessed By: Josh

##### Notes:

* Overall good code.
* User model knows too much about the Twitter service which will make refactoring in the future difficult. All calls to Twitter originate there. 
* Look into Ruby's delegate method to move logic somewhere else.

##### Scores:

*Feature Delivery*

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3

*Technical Quality*

* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3

*Product Experience*

* User Experience: 4


#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

**Farmer's Market Platform.** Pivot another Little Shop project into a multitenant market platform. Group project; worked with Jason Pilz, Justin Pease and John Slota.

##### Feature Delivery
Assessed By: Andrew

*Notes:*
* Friendly UI, nice nav bar, predictable behavior.
* Multitenancy not implemented at routes level for all pages.
* When a new store admin is added to a store, the user can't access the store's admin features.

*Scores:*

* Completion: 2.5
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 3

##### Technical Expectations
Assessed By: Josh

*Notes:*
* Thorough testing; good tests, not quite exceptional but above average
* Needed more unit tests; at least one test for every custom method written on a model
* Solid code quality; remove comments
* Put some methods unused in controller to helper folder
* Great method naming; easy to read

*Scores:*
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Code Quality: 3.5


## Community

### Giving Feedback

Justin Pease: "Justin is personable and brought balance to the personalities in the group. He’s a hard worker, regularly staying late to finish a piece of code. He’s open to pairing and receives feedback incredibly well. I enjoyed working with him."

John Slota: "When I first started working with John, I mistook his care-free nature for a lack of work ethic. ​I was wrong.​ When focused, John is a highly capable programmer. He dives in and gets the job done. His knowledge of the original code base and work on the cart/shopping functionality were critical to our success."

Jason Pilz: "As always, Jason is capable and reliable. He’s a joy to work with. If he doesn’t know how to approach something, he figures it out. He’s open to feedback but will push back (in the best way) when he believes in something. His independent thinking and hard work carried us far in a difficult project."

### Being a Community Member

“I had the pleasure to work with Emily during the pivot this module, and **she was voted to take a difficult role as project manager, of which she performed very well and drove us though some difficult organizational issues successfully**. I admire how focused and dedicated to the project she is, and is always willing to pair & repair a difficult code problem. **Her technical skills are impressive, and I appreciate how approachable she makes herself for collaboration.**" — Jason Pilz

"Emily was really good to work with. She was nominated as team lead and did a fantastic job. I am a person that needs external structure and Emily provided that. She had a good sense of the project from day 1 and was able to balance organizing the team, producing code, and her family all at the same time for our Pivot project. **She was able to grow and adapt to the needs and intricacies of the team members in her leadership role.** I had a lot of fun working with Emily and the team." — Justin Pease


### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Met with Rolen Le every Wednesday evening for an hour
* Taught HTML at DSST Middle School on Friday, January 8
* Joan Clarke Society


## Review

### Notes

## A: End-of-Module Assessment
