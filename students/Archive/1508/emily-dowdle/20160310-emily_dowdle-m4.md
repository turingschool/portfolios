# Emily Dowdle - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

**M4 Update:**
Holy shit I actually did this.

I moved to Denver for Turing with a 6-month-old and a tepid belief that I could actually do this. I had zero experience with coding but took to it pretty well. I'm far from the best in our module but I'm proud of the work I've put in and my growth — professionally and personally.

I never would have thought that years of writing blogs for other people would help me with programming. But it sets me apart from those who started playing with computers in utero and have a natural knack for coding.

I've always been surprised by people whom I don't consider special or even that smart that take off and become break-out successes. I believe it's those who promote themselves most effectively that succeed, not those who necessarily deserve it.

And it's my intention to be one of those successes. What I lack now is long-term focus and patience. I need to develop an ability to work on the same thing unrelentingly for years.

**M3 Update:**
I'm working on staying calm and working through problems methodically.

**M2 Update:**
I want to continue to push myself beyond Turing's expectations and pursue my own projects.

**Original:**
I came to Turing to learn.

I like to read about business culture and, when appropriate, apply the same methods to my own life. VCs talk a lot about the 10X return. **My goal for Turing is to leave with 10X the knowledge I walked in the door with.**

My growth and performance throughout the module has proved to me that I am well on my way to accomplishing that goal.


### Attendance

* I missed one day due to an illness and a few more due to interviews. I think I may be the most prolific interviewer at Turing.

Assessed By: Meeka

#### Notes:

* Neat implementation for a way someone would use it

#### Bartleby

**Ember + Electron.** Sigh.

Assessed By: Steve

#### Notes:

* This project went to hell due to too-long and too-complex technical interviews.
* Steve and I made the decision that I should focus on interviews and we'd figure points out later.
* I will approach Ember and Electron individually in the future. Doing both at the same time made it too confusing to figure out what was Ember and what was Electron.

#### Scores:

* 60 points for an [awesome blog post](http://www.emilydowdle.com/blog/ember-electron)

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/fall-down-js)
* [Original Assignment](http://matt-stj.github.io/fall-down-js/)

**Fall Down.** Users direct a ball using the left and right arrow, earning a point each time it passes through the gate.

Assessed By: Meeka

#### Notes:

* High score maybe should have name or notify the user where their high score ranks
* Add integration tests with sinon for canvas tests

#### Scores:
* **TOTAL: 275 points**
  * Check-in 1: 50
  * Check-in 2: 50

#### DTR

Matt Stjernholm and I had a DTR conversation prior to Game Time but did not formalize it in a written memo.

### Giving Feedback

Matt Stjernholm: "Matt was a solid partner for Game Time. We paired well together on difficult aspects of the project while splitting up other aspects of the build. Matt communicates well and shows an enthusiasm for programming. Toward the end of the project, we struggled to clean up the code and remove bugs. Even in stressful moments, Matt showed composure and thoughtfulness."

Jason Pilz: "Jason Pilz is a great developer. Period. I’ve worked with him numerous times over the last three modules and I have zero hesitation in recommending him for anything. He’s one of the hardest workers in our module and is extremely reliable. On top of all that, he’s a great programmer. His natural curiosity lends him motivation to discover and explore new skills — even leading multiple electives with Ryan on DevOps. I can’t speak highly enough of Jason or his work ethic."

Sekhar Paladugu: "Sekhar, Turing’s greatest event planner, fundraiser and connector. Sekhar never hesitates to jump in and lend a helping hand when I need help. He deeply cares about the wellbeing of those around him and it shows. Sekhar was the first to point out my weakness with pair programming in Module 1 and his honest feedback helped me to grow and improve. I’m grateful to have met him and hope to work with him in the future."


### Being a Community Member

Sekhar Paladugu: "**Emily has impressed me from the beginning in how hard she works and how doggedly she pursues learning all material at Turing and applying it quickly.** Everyone of course gets wide-eyed when they realize that Emily has a young child at home, just six or seven months old when we started back in August, and also juggles the often 60-70 hour weeks Turing demands. **It's awesome that even with that Emily still contributes, frankly, more effectively while remote on group projects than most of us in 1508.** I'm personally most inspired by the lack of complaints Emily gives about her busy everyday life, in comparison to most Turing students including myself. She rarely lets a negative comment slip and all the while continues to chug along. I know Emily will make an excellent professional programmer and am glad to hear she's staying in Denver, and could not think of a more deserving person for a great job offer. Congrats on finishing up this week and the new role!"

Matt Stjernholm: "**I really enjoyed my time pairing with Emily** on Game Time. We’d only paired together once before during our time at Turing, and I was happy to get one last chance before graduating. **She has a great grasp on how to get projects off the ground** and knows how/when to test the right things. Our Game Time project was one of my favorite projects from Module 4 and a large part of its success was due to Emily as a teammate."

Jason Pilz: "I have been privileged to work on multiple projects with Emily. **Time after time, she consistently demonstrates her strong technical ability, natural leadership skills, and positive attitude**, all while tackling any challenge she is tasked with. I respect her dedication to continually push herself to always improve and take on harder and harder challenges…and share the successful outcome with others. Any employer would be lucky to have a developer like Emily on their team!"

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Led the beginner track at Denver.rb on Tuesday, March 8
* Served as the pre-work guide for Karina Gonzalez
* Mentored by Rolen Le
* Joan Clarke Society

In regards to Posse Challenges, I am in the closet (I'm kinda gonna miss that place) from 8:30 to 9:00 each morning and participating in the posse challenge in any real way this module was difficult. I do my best to support those in my posse in other ways and make myself available to students who might need help.
