# Sekhar Paladugu - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Coming into this module I felt comfortable with Ruby but curious about what was to come given the focus on Rails. I wanted to see how my Ruby foundation would interact with everything we were going to learn in Rails and build real, tangible projects. The intermission week was tough due to a couple of family issues I had to deal with. I flew back to LA at the last minute to spend five days at home with my parents and did not dive into the material as deeply as I originally envisioned. Overall though I felt Rails and MVC in general really started to click for me in the final two weeks of the module. The mini-project Ideabox came to me pretty naturally, and with Jill we completed it with all the features implemented and tested. The final project felt like a fun challenge and we worked consistently on it throughout the two weeks. Little Shop was a great culmination of all the material we'd studied all module.

### Attendance

I missed the first day’s first half (morning class time) this module, when folks worked with bootstrap. I was on a sudden trip out of town and mainly I booked the ticket around price and not schedule, but also wanted to spend a bit more time with my family. I cleared this with Rachel beforehand and gave her as much notice as I could.

### Work

I thoroughly enjoyed Little Shop this module, and also felt that Traffic Spy was a strong learning experience for me. On Traffic Spy I still felt uncomfortable with MVC and Sinatra was totally new, so I often groped around in the dark and had a lot of trouble debugging. In the end my group turned in a good project but I did not feel like I would have been able to do it on my own immediately after. On the other hand, by the end of the module Little Shop was an all around success and I felt like I knew our codebase inside out. My group had a good dynamic, we were all at skill parity, and we communicated regularly and effectively every day both in person and through remote tools (Slack, Screenhero, GitHub and more). We built a shop that sold stickers for developers, and we completed effectively all features and two extensions on time. I’m excited to refactor this project a bit more and put it in my portfolio, I felt like we did a solid job and it was my best group work experience so far at Turing.

### Projects

#### Little Shop

#### Team: Sekhar Paladugu, Emily Dowdle, Jason Pilz

##### 1. Feature Completeness - 3
Implemented 1 extension and had small bug in regular feature so they evened out. Will try to fix before demo. All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

##### 2. Views - 3
Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through.

##### 3. Controllers - 3
Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts.

##### 4. Models - 4
Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features.

##### 5. Testing - 3
Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

##### 6. Usability - 3
Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready.

##### 7. Workflow - 3
Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Traffic Spy

#### Team: Sekhar Paladugu, Ross Edfort, Cole Hall

#### Evaluation Notes
Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.

##### Functional Expectations: 3

##### Test-Driven Development: 3

##### Encapsulation / Components: 3

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

##### Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3

##### View Layer: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

My feedback to Emily: "Emily has been a wonderful partner to work with. She is diligent, self-sufficient and yet asks for help when she needs it. Every time I wanted to pair with Emily she'd find a stopping place and jump on whatever problem I needed assistance with. I'm impressed with how willing Emily is to seek out new knowledge on her own, whether through reading documentation or other posts online, or asking fellow developers for help. She also has strong habits for collaborating and remote work, regularly updating Jason and me on her progress, any roadblocks, and checking in about group expectations. With her guidance my team learned a lot about GitHub these past two weeks. Overall Emily has been a great partner to work with, and I look forward to working with her again soon."

My feedback to Jason: "I enjoyed working with Jason and would happily do a project with him again if given the chance. Jason was a fun partner who I looked forward to working with each day, and he took on many challenges while also communicating well with the rest of the team. Even with three kids at home and many family commitments, Jason went above and beyond each day, on Sunday alone spending six hours implementing the extension Paperclip with AWS. We paired the most in our group with each other, probably about half of our total time coding this project, and I found Jason to be easy to collaborate with and never demanding or overbearing. It's a bonus too that he's just a funny and friendly guy. I'd happily work with him again."

### Being a Community Member

Emily Dowdle: "Sekhar is an excellent team member. He is kind, respectful and truly cares about those around him. On top of that, he's a talented developer and often approaches problems from a different perspective than my own. I am better for having worked with him and I greatly hope to work with him again."

Jason Pilz: “At the onset of our project we appointed Sekhar as project manager, and by the time of project completion, it was obvious why we had done so! I was hoping I would bet the chance to collaborate with Sekhar at some point, and happily, I got the chance during our little shop project. He proved himself to be very focused, motivated and efficient. He was excellent and pairing and always entertained our teammates ideas. He was always willing to tackle the jobs that other did not desire, and always delivered on his tasks. My skills were increased by being able to work alongside him during this project. I look forward to the chance to work with Sekhar again!"

### Playing a Part

* Volunteered to demo and speak with visiting students from  a local African Community Center on a Friday evening show off Enigma from Module 1
* LGBTuring - we did another Hamburger Mary’s event after Field Day and also did a lunch the first week which we had many 1510-ers join
* Social Committee work, such as planning Halloween (candy, costume contest, decorating) and other things
* Field Day
* Planning and hosting Turing Thanksgiving
* Brought in breakfast Nov. 13 and Nov. 20 (weeks 5 and 6) and cleaned up afterwards
* Went to the instructor candidate SQL class (Nate) and helped organized the dinner at D’Corazon afterwards
* Organized, collected money and bought the gifts (chocolates from Enstrom’s) for teachers after module 1 and 2 from 1508

## Review

* Feels good with rails right now. Interested in how MVC is applied to pther frameworks
* Great at organizing student events. Super invloved in the community. 
* Has a ton of potential and needs to really focus on accomplishing what you can. 
* Push yourself to be uncomfortable and grow technically. 
* Find a mentor. Try to set up a regular time to meet. 


### Outcome
