# Sekhar Paladugu - Module 4 Portfolio - March 10, 2016

## Individual

### Your Mission

For Module 4, my goals were to learn JavaScript and start the process of job hunting. Often those two goals were in conflict, but my hope is that the JavaScript foundation that I have built this module will help give me momentum in learning different frameworks (like React, Angular and Express) after graduating this week. I've loved learning Ruby on Rails and would be happy to continue programming in that language and framework as a professional, but on the flip side I see how much more value I've gotten out of learning a second language. Rather than just pattern matching within just Ruby or Rails, I'm seeing parallels between two different languages and in the process learning foundational concepts at a deeper level. It doesn't hurt that JavaScript is everywhere and I suddenly have a much broader insight into how the web works. Overall I'm happy with how this module turned out.

### Attendance

I attended all classes this module except Friday, March 4th (out sick), and otherwise have missed zero required activities.

### Work

I completed all the major projects successfully this module, but I was less pleased with my work this time around than my prior modules. I think I can attribute that time to less focus and time spent on Turing work than my prior three modules due to job hunting, networking (Meetups etc.), and interviewing. While it was dizzying digging through four JavaScript frameworks in about two weeks, on the flip side I've enjoyed getting a taste of different varieties of Javascript out in the wild. My favorite project was probably RealTime, given that it was fun to work with WebSockets and that Express reminded me a lot of Sinatra. I also love the "party mode" Amber spearheaded with the "All Night Long" music by Lionel Richie playing in the backgrtound, on our GameTime Snake.

### Giving Feedback

My feedback to Erinna Chen (1511/Module 2 Student/Matsumoto Posse): "You are a coding boss! You are always willing to try new/different things (coding a posse challenge in Python, etc.) and are constantly improving your craft, such as using keybindings or learning simpler syntax. Both of those are amazing traits in a developer. Because you are so far ahead of the curve in terms of students at Turing, I'd work on getting others more involved and providing the solution less, since it'll help their learning process more/allow them to talk more. Of course with posse time, it's hard to do that, and you have at so many points worked our mod 1 folks in and asked them their thoughts. My guess though is in general that your tendency is to drive more often? Just a conjecture. Keep up the great work Erinna! I've loved having you in my posse."

My feedback to Kris Foss (1602/Module 1 Student/Matsumoto Posse): "I've worked with Kris all module in our renewed Matsumoto posse, and I've really enjoyed watching her grow as a developer. Kris has a strong desire to learn and work ethic, and even with a difficult commute in from DTC she has made attending posse on time a priority during her first six weeks at Turing. As we work on challenges together or talk through her projects, it's clear Kris has managed to stay afloat during her time here by putting in solid effort to learn foundational concepts. I'm excited to see how she takes on her second module here! Keep up the great work Kris :)"

My feedback to Jenny Soden (1602/Module 1 Student/Matsumoto Posse): "Jenny has been an awesome addition to the renewed Matsumoto Posse this module. In her first six weeks here she has hit the ground running and quickly dives into whatever challenge or project Turing has thrown at her. I think Jenny can work on building up her programming confidence, because from what I've seen she has all the qualities and ability she needs to become a strong developer and Turing graduate - such as curiosity, hard work, and interest in improving her craft. I've enjoyed working with Jenny on posse challenges all module and hearing how she approaches problems through the questions she asks. Good luck with the next module Jenny and don't forget to Slack me if I can ever help at all :)"

My feedback to Adam Jensen (1508/Module 4 Student/Project Partner): "Adam has been awesome to work with this module. Back when Adam was in 1507, I had always enjoyed chatting with him, and once I found out he was joining our group in December I knew I wanted to work with him on a project. For our front-end focused group Bartleby, we built a desktop note-taking application in Ember and Electron. Adam took initiative to figure out the FileBin open source contribution portion of our project, digging through Node websites and dealing with moderately complex GitHub issues. Without Adam we would not have gotten as far in the project as we did. I've also always been impressed with how curious Adam is and how the interest he takes into digging into the 'why' behind many programming issues and principles. When I was finishing up the Pivot Adam took time to teach me how to do controller tests, and he launched into a discussion of the merits of model/feature testing versus a robust set of controller tests. I've really benefitted from Adam's insight and enjoyed having an eager learner like him in my class."

My feedback to Amber Crawford (1508/Module 4 Student/Project Partner): "Amber was a rock star to work with for Game Time. I basically knew that going in, which is why I requested to pair with her, but overall I could not have been happier with how our final project turned out. I had had a hectic intermission and did not do as much of the pre-work as I would've liked (had to head to a funeral out of state), so my JavaScript skills were not where I wanted starting the project. Amber took me under her wing and we paired throughout the project and she regularly took the lead in building out features and debugging major issues. What constantly impressed me was how Amber was always two or three steps ahead of me when pairing - her first hunch was regularly right and it kept our project moving quickly. Amber is the perfect honor roll student here at Turing - she has juggled module 4, job hunting effectively out of state and heading out of the country to Israel for ten days during classes and succeeded. I can't wait to see what she's up to after Turing!"

My feedback to Torie Joy-Warren (1508/Module 4 Student): "Torie has been a pleasure to have as a classmate the past seven months. Her dedication to learning and her natural programming ability have made her a great resource for everyone in 1508 and at Turing more broadly. I've been inspired by Torie's ability to figure out concepts on her own and really just focus/get in the flow of working self-sufficiently. In 1508 Torie is one of the students everyone looks up to and tries to emulate as a model developer. I have no doubt Torie will make Turing proud as an alum :)"

My feedback to Emily Dowdle (1508/Module 4 Student): "Emily has impressed me from the beginning in how hard she works and how doggedly she pursues learning all material at Turing and applying it quickly. Everyone of course gets wide-eyed when they realize that Emily has a young child at home, just six or seven months old when we started back in August, and also juggles the often 60-70 hour weeks Turing demands. It's awesome that even with that Emily still contributes, frankly, more effectively while remote on group projects than most of us in 1508. I'm personally most inspired by the lack of complaints Emily gives about her busy everyday life, in comparison to most Turing students including myself. She rarely lets a negative comment slip and all the while continues to chug along. I know Emily will make an excellent professional programmer and am glad to hear she's staying in Denver, and could not think of a more deserving person for a great job offer. Congrats on finishing up this week and the new role!"

My feedback to Mike Wong (1508/Module 4 Student): "I've really enjoyed having Mike in 1508 these past two modules. Mike is always smiling and regularly makes himself available to help others when they're stuck. I've always thought of Mike as one of the more curious students at Turing, which is a great quality in a developer. Mike usually digs deeper into understanding what's happening in the code and pairing with him gives me new insights into how software works."

### Being a Community Member

Erinna Chen (1510/Module 2 Student/Matsumoto Posse): "I really got to know Sekhar this module through an effort to be more involved with posse. He is such a giving person, and his desire to be welcoming and inclusive towards everyone will be sorely missed when he graduates. While pairing on posse challenges, Sekhar was a knowledgeable programmer. While I was driving, he tended to be able to read the code that I was generating and was a far more effective communicator to the new Module 1 students than I was. I think Sekhar's weakness ties in directly to his strengths. He seems to be spread thin and can get stressed when juggling all his obligations. Perhaps, knowing when to say no will be helpful in the future. But I completely am amazed at how much of a contributor he has been to the community at Turing."

Kris Foss (1602/Module 1 Student/Matsumoto Posse): "Sekhar has been a great mentor for the incoming posse members.  He’s welcoming and encouraging and despite his vast programming knowledge he doesn’t talk down to people with less experience.  He always takes the time to check in with us and ask us if we need anything.  He’s been a great source of support through this rough first module.  He has also gone out of his way to be at posse meetings every day, even though he’s practically out in the workforce.  I feel lucky to have had him in our posse and I know he’ll find a great job."

Adam Jensen (1508/Module 4 Student/Project Partner): "I recently paired with Sekhar on Bartleby. Sekhar is a great partner that is much better at time management and getting things done that I am. I really appreciate his ability to balance jokes and work. Honestly, I dont thinkk I’ve ever joked around that much on a project (Probably a bad thing). To go a bit further. I personally struggled during Bartleby. Sekhar is probably the only reason I got anything done. I know he had other things to do as well, but he was diligent in helping out and pulling his weight. I would fully endorse Sekhar as a partner and programmer."

Amber Crawford (1508/Module 4 Student/Project Partner): “Sekhar was the perfect partner for our GameTime project!  He is a natural leader and really stepped up on this project keeping us on track and thinking about the big picture throughout.  When I would start to stray down an inefficient work-path, he would always be the first to take a step back and ask the important questions to move our work onto a better path.  More than that, he has been an amazing and essential member of the Turing community and I am so happy to have been able to work with him throughout our 4 modules.  Can’t wait to see where he goes next!"

Torie Joy-Warren (1508/Module 4 Student): "Oh Sekhar. He knows when to ask for help, and he’s always willing to give it. If he can’t help, he always knows what or whose direction to point you in. He’s been key to the cohesion of 1508 and is incredibly inclusive. He will make Turing proud in the real world."

Emily Dowdle (1508/Module 4 Student): "Sekhar, Turing’s greatest event planner, fundraiser and connector. Sekhar never hesitates to jump in and lend a helping hand when I need help. He deeply cares about the wellbeing of those around him and it shows. Sekhar was the first to point out my weakness with pair programming in Module 1 and his honest feedback helped me to grow and improve. I’m grateful to have met him and hope to work with him in the future."

### Playing a Part

* Updated/put up again the headshots with names boards at the entrance. In future modules I'm hoping to have a current 1602 student do this
* Got gifts for teachers in module 4 - mainly Mini Pat Party Stand Up and Pat Wey trading cards for everyone
* Planned our graduation dinner at Coohills and the after-party at the Vault
* Planned and booked the mountain house in Winter Park for those who opted in for 1508, and will be buying all the food/alcohol
* During the last intermission, went to Matt Rooney's wife's school (a DSST charter middle school in Stapleton) and spoke to her students with Matt about programming at their opening assembly, and showed off our personal project apps
* Working with Course Report/Liz Eggleston to get Chris Cenatiempo's story featured about graduating from Turing and moving to Hawaii from Kansas. Will be a neat piece once it's up!
* Attended TAAAP (Turing Association of Asian American Programmers) events, including group lunch and local Asian American event in Stapleton organized by Joanne Liu. Excited to see where this group goes, since lots of alum and students from every module are turning out
* Served as the assigned "culture leader" for Matsumoto Posse and corralled the group (with Erinna's help!) to restart and work through the new posse challenges all module
* Ran a funny series of Slack bots all module to lighten the mood in various channels :P
* Served as a facilitator for an allyship Gear Up in the middle of the module
* Bought two monitors that Turing reimbursed me for from Best Buy and set up two additional work stations in the Big Workspace (19 inch ASUS monitors)
* Continuing to rework the LGBTuring group - we did two outings this module, a lunch the first week of the module, and an open happy hour for everyone. In future modules, I'm hoping July Tran will lead this group (she's agreed to this already). Multiple LGBT students expressed interest in a private channel and a more private outing for folks who do identify as LGBT. We have a set up private channel but we need to broadcast to Turing that it exists and folks should message one of us to opt into it, and there should be something like a breakfast for Turing community members (students, alums, staff etc.) who identify as LGBT say once a module. Will likely spend our budget in future modules on the breakfast event instead of the open happy hour.
