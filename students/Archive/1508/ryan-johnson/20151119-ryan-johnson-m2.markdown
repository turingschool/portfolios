## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission as a Turing student is to not only become the best developer I can be,
but to also have a positive impact on my cohort and the Turing community. To
Embody what a Turing student should be and to put forth my best effort in
everything I do.

My goal for this module was to really improve my knowledge of rails (ie. Active
Records, MVC framework, etc), as well as learn more about front end frameworks.
I also wanted to retain my ruby knowledge from module one.

### End of Module Assessment

My end of module assessment was performed by Mike Dao

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking - 3
* Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library - 3
* Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API - 3
* Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style - 3
* Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing - 3
* Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration - 4
* Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


### Attendance

I did not miss any days in module 2.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Exorcism
The Exorcism's I completed this module helped me retain some of the ruby concepts
that we started in module one. I want to continue to do these throughout the program.

* Difference of Squares - a program where you find the difference between the sum
 of the squares and the square of the sums of the first N natural numbers.

* Roman Numerals - A program that can convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals


## Team

#### Traffic Spy

* https://github.com/rjohnson4444/traffic-spy-skeleton

In this group project, we used Sinatra to develop an application that tracked
traffic for websites.


* Overall good work.
* Server(controller) could be a little skinnier but made good use of POROs.
* Testing was good too, make sure to test all AR models for validations.
* Continue to TDD. Be careful of nameing variables.
* Be a little more robust with feature tests - click through some functionality.
* Great use of scoping feature tests.


* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

#### Litte Shop of Orders

In this group project, we made a eCommerce store with cart and checkout
functionality

* https://github.com/JaggedLaw/My_Coffee_Order

* bugs
* inconsistent behavior through user and admin experience, check duplicated headers
* footers, like to see PORO to handle order creation (push logic down the stack),
* remove admin logic from regular controllers,
* mostly good test coverage -- a little lite on model tests, check robustness of tests to ensure tests catch bugs/missing features"


* Feature Completeness: 1.5
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 3
* Testing: 3
* Usability: 1.5
* Workflow: 4


## Community

### Giving Feedback

Throughout the module, I gave constructive and concise feedback to the Turing
staff as well as Turing students. When giving students feedback, I tried to
be as frank as possible, while keeping them abreast of the positive aspects of
their work.

Feedback I gave to Matt Stjernholm: “I really enjoyed working with Matt. He is a very skilled developer and I was able to learn a lot from him. His focus and work ethic really motivated me to do my best work. I would definitely want to work with him on any other project in the future."

Feedback I gave to Jhun de Andres: “Jhun was a joy to work with. His sense of humor and awesome personality made working on our project really fun. He has one of the best work ethics of any person that I have worked with and it shows in the work he produced. I would definitely work with Jhun on any project in the future."

Feedback I gave to Charissa Law: “Charissa was great to work with. Her positive attitude and effort really helped the group moral during the project. She is a very encouraging person and I would definitely work with her on a future project!"


### Being a Community Member

As a community member of Turing, I tried to be a positive influence on the
community members around me. I felt that I did as much as possible to help my
fellow student.

* Feedback from Matt Stjernholm:
  "Ryan was a great parter to have on my first project of module 2.  We had very similar working styles and he always brought a critical eye to the code we were writing.  I'm impressed by his knack to grasp new concepts and implement them quickly. Looking forward to working with him again."

* Feedback from Jhun de Andres:
  "Ryan was probably one of the best partners I've ever had here at turing. He's this amazing mix of
  positivity, patience, and knowledge. He's a natural leader and I feel that he is an asset to this
  program. I've learned a lot from him and because of the pairing we did on our project I feel like
  the areas I was a little soft in where solidified."

* Feedback from Charissa:
  "Working with Ryan was such a good experience. I knew he was a great developer, but now I know he is also an incredible team player. He had great ideas and input throughout the project  that really led the project to fruition. This group dynamic was the best I had experienced yet at Turing and really opened my eyes to how great working with other people could be. Thank you Ryan!"

### Playing a Part

During my time at Turing, I had the opportunity to interact with many different
people within the Turing community.

* I reviewed Steve in 1510 with his Enumerable methods assignment and gave him
  some guidance on how I would approach each problem.

* I helped bring our possie back together after many of us did not want to participate
  in the warmups.

* I participated in all of the "Lunch Roulette" activities on fridays.

* I helped start a ios app for Turing with Jason and Aaron.

## Review

### Notes

* Feels like making headway into become the best developer he can.
* Feels really comfortable with rails. Is confident in navigating rails.
* Has explored some front end frameworks. Still finds it challenging, but is improving. 
* Needs to complete little shop to move forward. 
* Continue to pregress your possee. Stregnthen your bond with others.
