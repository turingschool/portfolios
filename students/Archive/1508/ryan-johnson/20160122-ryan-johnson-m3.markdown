# Ryan Johnson - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission as a Turing student is to not only become the best developer I can be,
but to also have a positive impact on my cohort and the Turing community. To
embody what a Turing student should be and to put forth my best effort in
everything I do.

My goal for module 3 was to focus on taking ambiguous requirements and make them
a reality. I also wanted to improve on my front end skills as well as learn more
about utilizing API's.

### Attendance

I did not miss any required days in module 3. I did miss 2 days that were considered
work days.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

## Team

#### The Pivot ( Lens-Lease/ Collectors Corner )

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tjkomor/bidding_wars)
* [Production URL](collectors-corner.herokuapp.com)

In this group project, we took an existing code base for a eCommerce store and
transformed it into a multi-tennant bidding site. My partners were Amber Crawford
and Tyler Komoroske.

##### Notes:
"App crashed when trying to add an additional admin to a store. And app crashed when trying to view user show page as admin. Some other minor implementation errors in editing user profile like changing the password."

##### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 3
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 3


## Individual

#### APICurious

In this individual project, I made a Twitter clone using the Twitter API while
implementing Twitter Oauth for user authentication.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/Fitter)
* [Production URL](http://fitter-twitter.herokuapp.com)

##### Notes:
All base functionality works on localhost but not on Heroku. Only missing favoriting.

##### Scores:

* Completion - 2+
* Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 3
* User Experience - 4


#### RailsEngine

In this individual project, I built an JSON and XML API using SalesEngine data.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/rails-engine)

##### Notes:
5 failures. A lot of tests (98%) but some don't test functionality. MVC is really solid. Super clean Controllers and Models. Using hashes in the model to format for the JSON response; should use serializers.

##### Scores:

   * Completion - 3:
     Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

   * Test-driven-development - 3+:
     Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

   * Code-quality - 3:
     Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

   * Api-design - 3:
     Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying
     mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

   * Queries - 4:
     Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including
     some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### SportsAddict (self-directed project)

In this individual project, I created a sports enthusiast social media web application.
I used Twitter Oauth for user authentication and API's from SportRadar and Stream.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/sports-addict)
* [Production URL](http://sports-addict.herokuapp.com)

##### Scores:

* Completion - 4
* Organization - 4
* Test-driven-development - 3
* Code-quality - 3
* User-experience - 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Throughout the module, I gave constructive and concise feedback to the Turing
staff as well as Turing students.

Feedback I gave to Tyler Komoroske:
 â€œTyler was a great asset to our team during the pivot
  project. His work ethic and ability to get things done under pressure was
  extremely valuable.  He showed great leadership qualities by taking on
  challenging technical tasks and was always available to help out his teammates
  with whatever we needed. It was a pleasure working with him and I look forward
  to paring up on future projects."


### Giving Feedback

As a community member of Turing, I tried to be a positive influence on the
community members around me. I felt that I did as much as possible to help my
fellow student.

* Feedback from Tyler Komoroske:
  "Ryan was an awesome teammate to have during the pivot. He consistently showed
   a willingness to get things done, even if that meant putting in a lot of
   hours. He was always willing to work whenever was best for team, and consistently
   demonstrated that flexibility throughout the project. His technical skills
   were well above average and were crucial in helping our team deliver a great
   product. Overall, Ryan was a pleasure to work with and I look forward to working
   with him again in the future."

* Feedback from Amber Crawford:
  "I was so glad to have Ryan on our team for the pivot project!  The quality of
   his work speaks for itself but, beyond just that, he also brought a calm
   confidence to team which was invaluable on a project like the pivot.  Ryan
   was extremely collaborative and constructive with the group while also taking
   on some of the tougher challenges of the project independently which truly
   made our site a success.  He is an excellent teammate and I hope to work
   with him again in Module 4!"

### Playing a Part

During this module, I had the opportunity to interact with many different
people within the Turing community.

* I performed my duties for clean up on most days (90%).

* I participated in all of the "Lunch Roulette" activities on Fridays.

* I led a student led session to help improve interaction with inner-city youth.
