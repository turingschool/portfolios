# Ryan Johnson - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission as a Turing student is to not only become the best developer I can be,
but to also have a positive impact on my cohort and the Turing community. To
embody what a Turing student should be and to put forth my best effort in
everything I do.

My goal for module 4 was to learn as much about Javascript as possible, while
focusing on the job hunt. I found it extremely difficult to do both well, but
I felt I was able to do a decent job.

### Attendance

I did not miss any required days in module 4.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Posse challenges (Zymuntowicz)

##### Turing Tower

In this challenge, we had to build a program that was able to solve the tower of Hanoi.

##### People Database

In this challenge, we built a program that mimics the functionality of a database.

##### Enumerables

In this challenge, I helped out with recreating some of the basic enumerable used in Ruby.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/idea-box)
* [Production URL](https://idea-box-ryan-johnson.herokuapp.com/)

In this project, we build a single page application for creating
and displaying ideas. This was the first project that used a good
amount of client side interaction with JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.


##### Score: 151/150 points

##### Notes:

Solid and clear JavaScript. Testing in models needed. Client-side
testing lacking. Couple of methods on Rails side could be refactor.
Good functionality and good UX. Overall, a solid project.

###### Project Requirements

* Data Model - 5 points
* Viewing Ideas - 10 points
* Adding a New Idea - 15 points
* Deleting an Existing Idea - 15 points
* Changing the Quality of the Idea - 15 points
* Editing an Existing Idea - 20 points
* Idea Filtering and Searching - 15 points
* Inline Idea Editing - 10 points

###### Instructor Evaluation Points

* Specification Adherence - 10 points
* User Interface - 5 points
* Testing - 5 points

* JavaScript Style - 8 points
* Workflow - 10 points



#### GameTime (Pong)

In this group project, Jason Pilz and I built Pong. This was harder than I
initially thought it was going to be because of the complexity of the
detection, but I really enjoyed how much I was able to learn throughout the
process.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/pong)
* [Production URL](https://rjohnson4444.github.io/pong/)

##### Notes:

##### Scores: 235/300 points



#### Scale Up (LookingFor)

In this group project, we built the first iteration of a rails application
that scrapes job posting websites and collects developer jobs. This was the
first project where we were exposed to "real" agile methodologies as a group.
We had daily stand-ups, communicated exclusively through github (i.e. issues,
PR reviews, etc), and all worked on the same codebase.

* [Assigned Issue](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/issues/15)
* [My Pull Request](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/33)

##### Scores: 160/150 points

##### Notes:

Great blog post (and thanks for the shout out!).
Good job with balancing this work with the UI version going out at the same time!

###### Blog Post (40 Points)

  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for
    Looking For or has one in depth blog post.

###### Participation (50 points)

  * 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person).
    Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and
    informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

###### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

  * 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated
    by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope
    of the curriculum.



#### Thoughtbox

This was a 9-hour practice run building a CRU application in rails for our final assessment.
We built a basic rails application for creating and displaying links. It was tough for
me because up until this point in mod 4, we hadn't done a lot in rails. However, I did
find the project beneficial.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/thought-box)
* [Production URL](https://thought-box-ryan-johnson.herokuapp.com/)

##### Scores: 70/100 points

##### Notes:

###### Main Chunk (70 points)

* 70: Application is deployed. All features are complete or some features are complete but
  developer showed effort to test drive coding the application. Developer worked entirely on
  their own for the entire application.

If above requirement is not met, grading this section is at the evaluators discretion.



#### Crowdsource (Real-poll)

In this individual project, I built a real-time polling application using Node.js.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rjohnson4444/real-poll)
* [Production URL](https://real-poll-ryan-johnson.herokuapp.com)

##### Scores: 130/200 points

##### Notes:

###### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?
50 points - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.

Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)
30 points - Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

Client-Side Application
30 points - Your application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components.

Test-Driven Development
10 points - Many areas of the code are not covered by tests.

Interface
5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

Workflow
5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Final Assessment

##### Scores: 77/125


#### Total Points for Module: 982

### Giving Feedback

* Feedback I gave to Jason Pilz:
  "It has been an honor working with Jason during module 4. I was fortunate enough
   to work with him on our GameTime project and it was a pleasure. His wide  knowledge
   base of everything software and his willingness to share what he learns with me has
   definitely been priceless. He has the ability to make complicated issues very simple
   has helped me grow as a developer and I am definitely looking forward to working with
   him with future projects! BOOMSKI!"

* Feedback I gave to Ling Tran:
  "It has been a pleasure working with Ling this module during posse time.
   Her work ethic and joyful personality makes her very easy to work with.
   As we went through the module, her technical ability grew exponentially
   and it showed in the questions she's asked and the work she's produced.
   If she continues to ask questions and ask for help when needed, she will
   thrive for the rest of her time at Turing and beyond. Great work Ling!"


### Getting Feedback

* Feedback from Jason Pilz:
  "I had the privilege of working with Ryan during our GameTime project, he proved
   himself to be extremely dedicated and resourceful in achieving our project goals.
   His attitude and work ethic made pairing very easy and enjoyable, he's always
   willing to try a different approach or idea. I was able to increase my skill as
   a developer because of the interactions during this and many other projects
   working with Ryan. He's a legend and I can't wait to team-up on a project again."

* Feedback from Ling Tran:
  "I am going to miss seeing Ryan every morning as we work through the posse challenges
   for these reasons. Ryan was a great posse team mate this module because he made himself
   available for questions about anything and has a very approachable air about him. When
   it came to programming questions, he was great at teaching rather than simply providing
   answers, which particularly enhanced my understanding of the Ruby object model. Thanks,
   Ryan, for being a great teacher and being a positive force in my first module at Turing!
   I know you will thrive in the real world!"


### Playing a Part

During this module, I had the opportunity to interact with many different
people within the Turing community.

* I co-taught 2 devops student led sessions with Jason Pilz.

  Shoutout from Marina Corona:
  "shout out to @jasonpilz and @ryanj for a sweet digital ocean session"

* I participated in all of the "Lunch Roulette" activities on Fridays.

* I paired with a student in mod 2 (Erinna) to help out with learning basic Javascript.

* I paired with a student in mod 3 (Dan) to help out with VCR issues.

* I participated in 4 of the 5 posse challenges during the module.
