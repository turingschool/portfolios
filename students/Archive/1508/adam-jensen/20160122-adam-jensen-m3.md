IMO, Module has some of the best projects. Here are my favorites:

#### The Pivot

###### The Pivot - Bidday App - Aaron Careaga, Jhun De Andres, Robbie Lane, Adam Jensen

* [ticketly](github.com/robbielane/ticketly)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

(description)
Students are given the task of Sacling a legacy Rails app to a Multi_tenant Rails
app while adding new features at the client's request.

(notes)
Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status.
Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.

* Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
* Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
* Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.

#### API-Curious - Solo
[Api-Curious](https://github.com/adamki/api-curious/)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations)

(description)
For all Solo projects below, I focused on NOT getting help and solving all issues on my own.

I loved this project because I was able to complete it on my own, write tests and finally understand
Stubbind and Mocking. It was also great to have some of the students ask me for help. coding and helping others
was a totally awesome experience and I hope to contrigbute in this way more in the future.

(Notes)
pretty strong technically; like the abstractions around managing the twitter connections - letting each user generate its own TwitterClient connection and delegating through various method calls
Testing is especially good on the client itself, and then a little lighter on the rest of the app, which is probably a smart allocation of effort
UI still could a little polish but the main interactions are all there added the retweet and reply to extensions

(Scores)
4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective

### Giving Feedback

##### Aaron Careaga
I love'd pairing with Aaron on the pivot and have gone back to pairing with him for smaller projects ad class work time as well.
Aaron is super calm and really great to pair with. I think Aaron brings out a really good balance of speculation and encouragement during pairing. THe reason why I mention this is because this balance really make pairing with Aaron productive. Usually when someone is off balanced,if can be harder to accomplish things. But Aaron can provide feedback without being overbearing and rude. Its Super effective.

##### Jhun De Andres
Adam Jensen. I am so thankful for this guy. I often go back in time to my first week in module 1 when he sat with me and taught me how to write a method in ruby. That willingness to help left a really positive impression on me. I had the opportunity to partner with Adam and it was a really great experience. I admire his ability to problem solve and share knowledge. When I have an issue with something I know that if I bring it up to Adam he’ll know what to do or he’ll know what direction to point me in. He’s constantly inspired me to stay curious and hungry with programming by the way he cleverly figures things out and the way he implements his code. Adam I’m thankful for you! You’re a good friend and I would never turn down an opportunity to program with You. You’ve taught a lot during my time here at turing. Thanks!

##### Regis Boudinot

If you could sum Regis'personatlity into just a couple words, I would propose the words "Helpful" and "Knowledgeable."
To dive a bit deeper, I mean, Regis has saved me from deep shit a couple of times. During Rales-Engine 1.0, Regis single handedly kept me from hitting my head on the wall after finding out helping diagnose my app with a deadly problem, It was using SQLite3. While I was sitting there wondering why ActiveRecord was so dumb, Regis helped my for over an hour and basically re-config'd my DB.yml. He could have been stressing along with everyone else that night. But he was calm and took time to help me. Regis is probably the only one in the school that night that would have been able to help me. Regis always knows stuff that other's dont. Why? Probably because of the countless hours the dude spends reading about Chef, or Space, or Unix etc. #mindblown
Oh yea, and there was another time that I wiped my OS with a fresh install and Regis basically helped me build a new Dev ENV in like 30 minutes. The funny thing is that he was enjoying it...
Summary: Regis helps everyone! He Helps mod 1-4 students. He helps Reddit by answeering Rails Q's. He doesn't ever stop.
I used to think that Regis Stressed alot. Back in M1, I do think that he would stress himself out a bit. But, really, I can't fault him. 
One Criticism. Regis tends to go quickly sometimes. Regis can explain things very well, but sometimes doesn't. But then again, I can usually call him out and he realizes that he needs to explain something again and he's cool with it. The cool part is that he never gets upset of frustrated. It's kind of funny actually. Regis is just REALLY into everything. It's hard to keep up.


### Recieving Feedback

##### Robbie Lane

Adam was an excellent group member and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him on the pivot. He was a joy to pair with and because of his knowledge, was easy to bounce ideas off of. Adam is easy to work with because he is motivated and stays on task. I am confident he will be an outstanding developer.

##### Jhun De Andres

Good: I felt totally confident that you would get all of your work completed on time. You’ve made a great network a mentors and I think it’s made you a stronger programmer. I also relied heavily on you for all of my front end problems. So great to have that opportunity to learn from you! Bad: In light of reading your note to me, I think what you said was very true. I think as a leader you know what you would like to do, but seem nervous telling people what to do . I think that’s why I started to be more vocal. It didn’t feel like we were progressing, but that was unfair to you as the person in charge. Don’t be nervous!! You know what you’re doing, so feel free to tell me, and others, what to do. Conclusion: I would definitely work with Adam again!

##### Aaron Careaga

I’m so glad that we partnered on the Pivot. I really appreciate your ability to deliver features and take on challenges in technologies that you are unfamiliar with. You continuously push me to further my level of understanding of languages that will improve our process. You are an amazing developer, and any company would be lucky to have you as a partner on their team.


##### Regis Boudinot

Adam is a javascripter. His interest in promises, closures, and all that is new JS frameworks is contagious.
He continuously pushes why it’s so great!
His second time through Module 3 has shown a lot of improvement. He has a lot less stress, and seems to really enjoy the deep learning of what he already did!
The only negatives I have for Adam is that he can bring people down with him when he gets sad. The same can be said for me though. So this is more of a description on how much people care about him.

### Playing a Part

This module, I spent a LOT more time helping fellow students.
I reached out to Wes Bos, a React Tutorial writer, and got Turing a special deal so we can all learn React.
Presented a Student Led Session and taught students how to build a Chat application using the Meteor framework.
