Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

The Pivot:
Group: Jill Donohue & Ross Edfort & Jerrod Paul Junker

Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

GitHub: github.com/jillmd501/the_pivot

Production Link: stalk-photos.herokuapp.com

Notes: Not seeded with appropriate amounts of data. UI was otherwise generally good. There were issues with images overlapping buttons and other content which was apparently due to the person styling on a computer set up with different display preferences. App crashed when trying to load image from category page. Could not update user profile photo either.

Giving Feedback
    Gave to Ross- Youâ€™re a very nice, easy to work with person. You always seem willing to take on new challenges even if they seem a bit unachievable or intimidating at first.


Getting feedback
    From Ross- Jerrod was a pleasure to work with during the pivot. Whenever we ran into bugs, he was always looking for a solution, and his contributions were always helpful. I learned a lot from working with him.
    



Playing a Part
    Make sure I'm always curtious and prepared to help anyone who may need it.
    Worked on reaching out and becoming more of a part of turing in general.
