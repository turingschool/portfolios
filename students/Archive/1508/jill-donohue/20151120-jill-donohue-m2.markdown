# Jill Donohue - Module: 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

I wanted a totally different experience from Module One - less anxiety, more confidence, and a sense of belonging.  Technically, I really wanted to explore my passion for design in front end.

### Attendance

I attended class every day except for one day when I was sick.

#### Feedback from Marlo

You aren’t even close to the same type of person I knew in module one. You seem to have developed this super human calm for code and things that are broken. Your design aesthetic might possibly be the very best in our class. Once your ability to design in code matches your ability to imagine, you will quite literally be an unstoppable force and amazing front-end software developer. Over this project, I’ve watched you slowly find what you want to do with your life, at least for now, and it makes me so excited to have been apart of that with you. True story: after the second or third day of Little Shop, I went home, laid on my bed and wondered for at least 10 minutes what exactly happened to you that made you so much better of a programmer and partner. I still wonder how you seem to have improved so quickly. Either way, you are someone I admire, most ardently, and I am lucky to have had you on my team again. Like I said before, I feel as though I’ve watched you grow up and I am intensely excited to have been a part of it. Can’t wait to see what happens to you :simple_smile:

#### Feedback from Pat

Damn, Jill really blew me away with her work on coloRIDEo. From day one, she really was the heart and soul of our app and the glue that held our team together.  Additionally, her passion for our project kept me afloat when my interest or commitment would start to waiver.    I don’t know if I can overstate what she contributed to our project - she wrote all of the content, and made all of the styling decisions on top of what she contributed to the code base. She’s a badass developer and an incredible teammate. I hope we get to work together in the future

## Traffic Spy
