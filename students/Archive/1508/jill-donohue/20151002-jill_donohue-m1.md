Jill Donohue - Module: 1 Portfolio
Individual

Areas of Emphasis

My mantra from day one has been to focus on learning first and foremost.  While I realize I started with next to no knowledge of programming, I can proudly say that slowly, but surely concepts and abstractions started to make sense and come together.  However, what I consider to be almost a more important lesson is the environment that has been encapsulated within Turing.  Pairing, collaboration, and team building are all skills I have honed in Module One while making incredible friends and hopefully future colleagues as well.  I am proud of what I have learned and am excited for what will come in Module Two.

End of Module Assessment I

Assessed By: Jeff Casimir

Notes:
* Good comfort with problem solving
* Syntax isn't quite natural, a bit bumpy
* Concepts/algorithms are stronger
* Tons of progress
* Hash lookup and manipulation is very shakey

Below is a list of all projects and their scores for Module: 1.

Mastermind

GitHub URL https://github.com/jillmd501/mastermind_JD
Original Assignment https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown
Mastermind was my first project where I recreated the old game "Mastermind" which created a four letter secret sequence that the player had to guess.


Assessed By: Tess Griffin

Notes:

* Didn't finish some base expectations - cheat and quit
* Same note about constants, but fine for this project
* I liked each with index, I felt that was the best enumerable to use

Scores:

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
Test-Driven Development: 3
Functionality: 2
Breaking Logic into Components: 3


Chisel

GitHub URL https://github.com/jillmd501/chisel
Original Assignment https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown

In this assignment we built a parser that would take in a markdown file and output a html file.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

Notes:
* 8 tests
* Needs some more unit tests, all tests were integration
* Move files into a lib and test directory
* FileIO is the Chisel


Scores:

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Functionality: 2
Breaking Logic into Components: 3


Jungle Beat

GitHub URL https://github.com/jillmd501/jungle_beats
Original Assignment https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown

In this project we used linked lists to build a tool that plays a series of sounds and can be manipulated.

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

Notes:


Scores:

Functional Expectations: 2
Test-Driven Development: 3
Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
Looping or Recursion: 3

Enigma

GitHub URL https://github.com/emilydowdle/enigma
Original Assignment https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

In this project we used Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

Notes:
* Application was well tested, covered some edge cases, but      was weak in unit testing.
* Some tests were skipped, and one test hung.
* Code was well written using the model of sending messages as opposed to manipulating instance variables.
* Some minor opportunities to refactor.
* Some complicated enumerable using methods that used #each and #each_with_index could be refactored to take advantage of best-use enumerables.
* Encrypt/Decrypt can be refactored to use the same class, as well as a portion of the crack method.

Scores:

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
Test-Driven Development: 3
Functionality: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 4


Headcount

GitHub URL https://github.com/jillmd501/headcount
Original Assignment https://github.com/jillmd501/headcount https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

In this project we parsed CSV files in order to manipulate school data of Colorado to analyze relationships.

Community

"Jill is an excellent communicator whose strength is knowing how to diplomatically convey difficult topics. I believe Jill has the potential to be an excellent developer. Her greatest challenge is her own self-doubt. If she devoted the energy she spends doubting her abilities to programming, she would quickly outpace many of the students around her. Jill cares deeply about her peers and works tirelessly to help those around her work through challenges, allowing them to achieve more than they would have alone. I struggle to think and speak at the same time — especially about programming — and in the week we worked together, Jill never rushed or interrupted me. I am a better developer because I have worked with her."

"I am so thankful for Jill. She is generous and kind and always willing to provide help or an encouraging word. As we all know Turing can be extremely stressful at times and she makes that stress bearable because of her positive attitude and sweet spirit. I remember a specific time where I was really frustrated with Headcount and without batting an eye Jill looked at me and asked "Are you okay? Do you want to go on a walk?" and we talked it out. Turing is undoubtably a better place because of her."

"After working with her, I can now confidently say that Jill Donohue is one of the more phenomenal people I’ve ever met in my life. She’s incredibly focused and driven to do great work from the beginning to the end. This attitude inspires me more than I could ever describe; this attitude is what will make Jill an unstoppable force in the software community as well as any other community she so chooses to be a part of. Jill was able to teach me development concepts with such ardency and simplicity that I will never forget the lessons learned; they are what helped me pass my final assessment and are what continue to fuel my ability to flow through my final project. The one complaint I have for Jill is that it seems hard for her at times to see the brilliance and the effort she imparts on her own work. I wish she believed in herself as much as I know she should and as much as I believe in her. From here, anything is possible and hopefully by the end, we can work together to both develop the clarity of mind and confidence every great developer has."


Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Reached out to DJ for lightning talk on "The Power of Now" after encouragement from               cohort members

* Attended every single Joan Clark Society coffee meet-up on Tuesday mornings

* Connected with past manager who wants to meet with Jeff for future hiring of students

* Started "Inspiration of the Day" on 1508's private group to keep up morale

* Active in my posse and paired with several older members on Chisel and Mastermind


Review

Notes

* Area of Challenge: Put energy and attention into Jill. Push on setting a hard schedule for yourself. Remove decisions out of your day.

Outcome
