# Jill Donohue - Module 4 Portfolio (a.k.a. The BIG One)

## Individual

### Final Point count

1036/1218

### Areas of Emphasis

First off, I am still in awe of the fact that I have even made it to my final portfolio review - let alone without repeating.  That in itself is hands down the coolest/most bad ass/radest thing I have ever done.  I remember reading on the Turing website that it would be "the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life."  While that is true, words cannot even begin to explain how much this means to me.  


To sum it up, I wanted Module 4 to bring me full circle with my education and time here at Turing.  I wanted to finally have the confidence to help other modules.  I wanted to up my front end game.  But most importantly, I wanted to feel like a real developer.

### Projects

I thought Module 4 was going to be a blur of LinkedIn/Angel.co/JobVite, but boy was I wrong!  I must say that these projects were not only some of the more challenging feats of strength I have done at Turing, but also the most fun I have had as well. Little Shop is the only exception because, well, Pat and Marlo.

#### Rakes on a Plane

Tyler and I decided that games these days are way to fancy with all this candy crushing and what not.  So we decided to kick it old school and to fire up the old Nokia snake.  However, as we all know, Turing teaches us to be internet trolls so we went with a Samuel L. Jackson theme of 'Snakes on a Plane'...... but with rakes!  This game finally brought together the 'flow' of Javascript for me which was a relief!

"Jill was an awesome teammate during our Gametime project. She consistently showed motivation and desire to turn in a final project that exceeded expectations. She was always willing to work as hard as needed to make sure that we turned in a great project, even if it meant putting in extra hours. She has a knack for front-end design and was the driving force behind the UX in our project. Overall, Jill is an excellent teammate who always pays attention to the smallest details. Working with her in the future would be a pleasure!"


#### Jillica's Notes - An Adventure in Ember/Electron

Jessica and I dove head first into this project and really had a blast developing yet another note taking application, BUT ON A DESKTOP WHAT?! I am so grateful I chose to work on the front-end project, and I have had so many more job opportunities open up for me because of it.  I felt like the grasshopper and Steve was the sensei guiding us down this loopy path of trying to mash together Ember and Electron - twas lovely.  Oh and I wrote some super fun blogs too!

Oh Real Time, let me count thy ways.  YOU WERE HORRIBLE IN THE BEGINNING.  I heard rumblings from past students about Real Time and once again I did not listen.  However, with that being said, I sadly learn the most in projects that I have no idea what's going on in the beginning. It took until the 11th hour, but I finally felt comfortable moving through the project and debugging versus grasping in the dark.

* Jorge: "Some bugs on main functionality but nothing major. Close poll feature was not implemented. Some tests for the back end. More abstraction of code needed. Good use of EJS templates on the client-side."

### Posse Challenges
* [Goldberg Posse](https://github.com/weilandia/goldberg_posse_challenges)

Check out the DARLING picture of Adele (not the 'Hello' Adele btw).

Our posse had a lot of lower module students driving. I chimed in while we paired and wanted to really lend myself to Mod 1/2 students for general help and a pick me up talk when they need it.  I had a few talk to me about dropping/tricky projects/all around bad days and I have always said that the most valuable thing I could do to improve Turing is to be there emotionally for students.

- Posse Feedback from Ilana Corson: "Jill was always helpful in posse challenges. Being new to programming, Jill was able to relate to my struggles and was really encouraging through the module. In posse challenges, Jill took charge to make sure that all group members were accountable to the posse as a whole."

### Giving Feedback

"Tyler is not only a dark horse talent in programming, but a really fun teammate to have around when everything starts breaking.  He remained adamant about taking a more difficult, albeit stronger approach to the dreaded appending nodes to the snake which produced a better project in the end.  He is a FORCE when it comes to debugging and remained stubborn in the best way possible to fix a problem.  I can’t wait to see where he ends up and I would absolutely work with him in the future.  Cheers Tyler!"

"Jhun has been there for me since day one and Cheek’s first object model talk that left me questioning everything I knew about life.  His calming presence has been a necessary slow down that I need more often than not.  Not only is he an incredible friend, but I have also watched him work his butt off to become a force to be reckoned with in 1508.  I pulled the classic reality tv show approach when I first thought about Turing, “I’m not here to make friends.”  However, Jhun would not have that and I am so giddy to see all of the amazing socially conscious changes that he will make.  His strength in sniffing out problems in code, his work ethic, and his all around positive attitude will take him far in the tech world."

"If I could graph Aaron’s time at Turing, it would be a never ending upwards trend right off the page!  I am convinced that while Aaron remains quiet and reserved, he is secretly plotting to take over Turing and inevitably, the tech world as a whole.  In all seriousness, Aaron’s strength is his ability to remain calm and collected while the whole basement goes into meltdown mode.  His curiosity to learn new languages and frameworks astounds and inspires me to do the same.  I am proud to call Aaron not only an incredible classmate, but also an out of this world friend.  I can’t wait to see where he ends up and I hope one day to come back together as bad ass senior dev’s to tackle a project on our own."

* Aaron Careaga

"Jill is one of my favorite people to work with at Turing. She is an excellent developer with an infectious personality. Jill has a great ability at keeping the big picture in sight while coming up with a reasonable plan to get there. I can’t wait to see where she goes in her career. Any development team will be lucky to have Jill as a member."

* Jhun de Andres

"I am so thankful for Jill. I'd like to think that she's played a huge part in me finishing Turing. I have some very fond memories of her helping me out with my module 1 assessment. She sat win me and literally walked me through everything. As her friend it's been super cool to watch her become the amazing developer she is today as she has grown so much. Jill is confident in her craft and always willing to help those around her. I think that those two characteristics are going to take Jill very far in her career as a developer. She's artistic and she thinks critically. I believe the technical term for that is "unicorn". In all seriousness, Turing wouldn't be the same without someone like her and I'm glad our paths crossed like they did."

* Robbie Lane

"Jill is not only a top-notch developer, she is an amazing person. While I have not had the pleasure of working with Jill on any projects thus far, I have been constantly impressed with the quality of work she has produced. It is clear she has the work ethic and the determination to be an excellent developer. She is team player and is always willing to help the group. She will be an asset to whatever company is lucky enough to acquire her."

* Torie Joy-Warren

"Jill is smart as hell and amazingly supportive. She’s been such a key part of our cohort cohesion. I’ve learned a lot from her design and cover letter skills and she’s helped keep me sane by reminding me that it’s okay to go hiking on weekends and that having a life (even while at Turing) is a good thing. She’s been a really positive influence on 1508 both academically and socially."

* Mary Beth Burch (from last module, but it gave me the feels)

“Thank you for being a reliable, Tuesday morning presence in my time at Turing. I appreciated having someone to be honest with about how hard it is to have a real life here (yay for life as a side project!). Even though you are working so hard, you manage to stay light hearted enough to keep the people around you laughing. I think, as you move into module four, that you’ll be a really important presence for women who might be coming into the program a little unsure."
