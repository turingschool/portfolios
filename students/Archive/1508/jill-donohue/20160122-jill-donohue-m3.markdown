# Jill Donohue - Module: 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

My goal in Module 3 was to take initiative in group projects and to gain the confidence to finally start to feel like a "real developer."  I used my time off to explore more front end languages and I finally found my back end love - Rails Engine! BRING ON THE JOB SEARCH!

### Attendance

I attended class every day.... except for the snow day but I was there in spirit and the afternoon.

## Work

### Team Projects

Below is a list of all projects and their scores for Module 3.

## The Pivot - Stalk Photos

#### Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

Ross Edfort & Jerrod Junker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jillmd501/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_pivot.markdown)

In this project I used Ruby on Rails to pivot my existing code into a new project.  We also utilized Paperclip, Figaro, and Stripe for the first time.

#### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* User Experience: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
* Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

#### Notes:

Not seeded with appropriate amounts of data. UI was otherwise generally good. There were issues with images overlapping buttons and other content which was apparently due to the person styling on a computer set up with different display preferences. App crashed when trying to load image from category page. Could not update user profile photo either.

#### Feedback from Ross

"Jill was an absolute pleasure to work with during the pivot. She was highly motivated to work, and remained this way throughout the duration of the project. Her insights were alway helpful, and she has a great collaborative work style. I would recommend that she keep her excellent work ethic and attitude through Turing, and into the workplace."

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)
* [Heroku] (trelora-leaderboard.herokuapp.com)

In this project, Amber and I implemented AJAX calls, JS, and background workers to create a streamlined dashboard for TRELORA.

#### Assessed By: Josh Mejia

#### Feedback from Amber:

"Jill is one of my favorite people to work with at Turing!  Her bright and positive attitude makes the long hours go quickly and her passion for the projects, and particularly design, is great to have on your team. She gives clear and concise feedback, is extremely direct with both clients and teammates and pushed our project further than I would have thought on day one. Having worked with Jill in almost every module on at least one project, it's pretty awesome to see how far she's come and how driven she is to do better on every assignment.  Overall, she's a bit of a bad-ass and I'm so glad I got to work on this project with her!"

#### Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3
* TDD: 3
* User Experience: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* Performance: 4

#### Notes:

Good to see us take on a challenge and finish with very little intervention.

## Personal Site

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jillm501/personal_site)
* [URL] (www.jilldonohue.com)

In this project, I used Rails to build a personal site to share with future employers and stretch my design legs.


#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended every Joan Clark Society
* Helped 1510 students with various design issues

#### Random Unsolicited, Yet Valued Feedback:

"Thank you for being a reliable, Tuesday morning presence in my time at Turing. I appreciated having someone to be honest with about how hard it is to have a real life here (yay for life as a side project!). Even though you are working so hard, you manage to stay light hearted enough to keep the people around you laughing. I think, as you move into module four, that youâ€™ll be a really important presence for women who might be coming into the program a little unsure."
