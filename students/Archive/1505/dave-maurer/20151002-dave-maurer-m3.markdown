# Dave Maurer - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came into the module initially wanting to prove that I could excel my second time through. I also wanted to find out
if programming was something I would ever truly be passionate about. Stay tuned, this story continues at the bottom...

N/A

### Work

Individual Projects:

####Resolutionary - Self Directed Project

* [Github URL](https://github.com/davemaurer/resolutionary)
* [Production URL](http://resolutionary.herokuapp.com)

Completion: 4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

Takeaways: I felt much better about how to approach the process this time around. I choose a different project to force
myself to build from scratch again rather than copy and paste a lot of the basics. I build everything myself, with help
in only one area: 1 - Testing twitter and overall approach to writing tests thanks to Sean Griffin.  All views were
built putting together basic foundation building blocks and customizing them myself.

####Rales Engine

A Rails implementation of the Sales Engine Model

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davemaurer/rales_engine)
* Production URL - not enough room on my heroku account. Sorry.

was really proud of test coverage. Said he did and felt a lot better about the project this time around.

Completion: 2 - 4 failures, 4 erros.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - 100 % coverage. Really good work
Code Quality: 3 - could have had a little more refactoring in favorite_customer and not enough to go on becasue of lack of completeedness.
API Design: 4
Queries: 3

Takeaways: I was able to accomplish the basic metric faster this time around, and learned a lot more about active record.
Still slower with the business intelligence side, but able to get more things working this time around. Only 7 failing tests on
the spec harness.

####APIcurious

The purpose was to build a clone of the chosen service's functionality. I chose Twitter.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davemaurer/githubber)
* [Production URL](githubber.herokuapp.com)

Completion: 2
Organization: 4
Test-Driven Development: 2
Code Quality: 3
User Experience: 2.5

Takeaways: APIs are easier now. Need more practice with them to get comfortable, but I can do what I need to do when
given enough time.

## Team

### Projects

Group Projects:

####The Pivot

The end goal was to apply another layer of functionality with multi-tenancy on an inherited
Dinner Dash project.

Group members: Dave Maurer, Jack yeh, Adam Carron

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamcarron/the_pivot)
* [Production](http://way-out-there.herokuapp.com)

Completion: 1: Team completed the user stories and requirements partially.
Organization: 2: Team used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.
Test-Driven Development: 1: Code coverage was below 70%
Code Quality: 3: What code was there was excellent, but it was clear that there were large gaps due to the missing stories. Their cart in particular had almost no code. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a higher grade with so many potential code monsters left unexplored.
User Experience: 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

Takeaways: This assignment was difficult as we were all figuring out the code together. None of us was particularly strong
in any area, so it was a challenge to implement every feature. This was a great learning experience, as it forced me to
be a part of every aspect of the app.

### Feedback to me

I've been asking a lot of instructors and students how they think I'm doing this time around, and have gotten overwhelmingly
positive responses. I still have some polishing to do, but as Jorge put it during a one on one, I am asking the right questions
more frequently, and my conversations don't involved questions from me like 'what is that', or 'how does that work', nearly as
much as the previous pass through M3.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I participate in every survey, and take the time to fully answer the questions with the intent
of impacting Turing in a positive way. I try to give positive reinforcement to everyone I come
into contact with, and recently have been trying to act as a sounding board for those who are disillusioned
or apathetic to the Turing culture. I listen, then give my honest feedback and perspective to try to steer
people back onto a more realistic view of the Turing world, which is a great community that, like all communities,
sometimes has growing pains.

### Playing a Part

I admin to being more selfish this time around with my time and energy, and I think that is in large part due to me
freaking out initially about not passing the module the first time, and anxiety about perhaps not passing again. I have,
however, tried to act as a voice for the good that Turing does, and provide a counterpoint to the perception held by the minority
of the student body that the school is out to get us, or it's us against them. This simply isn't true, but you can't approach it
that way. Only through listening first, then explaining honestly your point of view can you effectively change the opinions of
those who are on the path to the turing 'dark side'.  Sorry for not doing more, but I found this time around that I needed a
little more 'me' focus.

## Review

I came into this module for the second time wondering if I'd be able to pass, and contemplating whether or not I would ever
actually be passionate about programming. In retrospect, I feel I outperformed my own expectations (admittedly they were a
bit pessimistic) and am proud of my progress. Regarding the passion. I'm still not sure I will ever live and breath code,
but when I found myself looking for 'cool things' to implement in my personal project, rather than 'things that will
let me get a higher score', I decided that maybe this programming stuff is becoming more than just a career path, which is
a wonderful feeling.

### Notes

* Is in a good place now about programming and the future.
* Got a lot of benefit out of the pivot.
* Knows he wants to be with a company that will help show him best practices.
* Getting better and better at programming everyday.
* Knows one of his weaknesses is still doing extremely complex things. Feels he can still do it it just takes longer.
* Repetition is key to remembering and learning
* Can learn what he needs to learn. Can find the answer and doesn't always need to ask someone.
* show an upward trend of completion. We need to be sure that it is sustainable and things can be done on a deadline.
