# Erik Butcher - Module 3 Porfolio

## Individual

### Emphasis Areas

Previously, I have focused on specific facets of the curriculum and projects, eschewing a more holistic development path or appearing uninvested or inattentive. While there were still a few trouble spots this time around, I have received feedback from the past few weeks that indicate that this is improving, but still far from ideal.
In addition, in an attempt to be self-reliant I was reluctant to ask for assistance when it would have been helpful or in some cases necessary. While the improvement in this area is not as strong, it is there, and I may now understand why I developed this problem in the first place.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on time, with no exceptions.

### Assigned Work

This module I completed the following:

#### Self-Directed Project: Roundaroute

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/with-a-k/roundaroute)
* [Production Website](https://roundaroute.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

In this two-week project, I created a service that allows users to generate a closed path for running or cycling from a location and a distance (in meters). Users log in with Twitter accounts, and routes are displayed using the Google Maps interface.

The project was evaluated with the following scores:

* Completion: 3- "Bare minimum of what was set out to be done. Skirting the line of 2 and 3."
* Organization: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 2
* Performance: Not Installed

I only had one month of free Skylight, and that's gone already; that's why the Performance score is Not Installed. Overall, I'm confident that Roundaroute went better than my previous self-directed project, but I may have fallen into the same trap as that one did in terms of commitment vs. delivery.

#### APICurious

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/with-a-k/git-gud)
* [Production Website](https://git-git.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

In this one-week project, I created an application that uses the GitHub API and OAuth strategy to display a user's GitHub feed and information when they log in with their GitHub account. The project was given the following scores during its evaluation:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 2.5

I'm very happy with how this turned out. UX has consistently been a weak area for me and I'm still not completely sure how to improve my skills in that area, but I also strongly improved my other weakest score, Test-Driven Development.

#### Pivot

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Drew242/the_pivot)
* [Production Website](http://technically-employed.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this two-week project, a team consisting of myself, Rick Bacci, and Drew Conly reworked Drew's Little Shop of Orders / DinnerDash project from module 2 to be a job search platform. The project was given the following scores during its evaluation:

* Feature Completion - 1
** Team completed the user stories and requirements partially.
* Project Organization - 4
** Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development - 3
** Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
* Code Quality - 2.5
** With so many missing features, there were definitely missing code monsters which would have been what made the code hairy.
* User Experience - 2
** Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

I am disappointed in myself for the lack of ownership I displayed during this project. While it likely is not entirely the source of the problems with the finished product, it is definitely the source of some of them.

## Team

### Feedback

I used an anonymous feedback form to gather feedback from other members of the cohort.

Common threads from the feedback I received this way include:
* Concerns over my ability to focus, but notes that indicate this is improving.
* Indications that I should be more aggressive in terms of self-challenge.
* Noticeable mastery of CS concepts and anything else I have passion for.
* Enthusiasm for problem-solving.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

1505 is not a cohort I understand very well - I feel uncomfortable around most of the people in it, for reasons I can't quantify beyond "they're unfamiliar". I haven't seen anything from anyone else that I feel overly concerned about from a programming standpoint, but nothing is quite standing out, either.

### Playing a Part

I participated in many events outside of the normal framework of Turing. I attended Denver.rb meetups and participated in the Lulzbot/Aleph Objects tour on field day (but didn't go to Devil's Backbone because I couldn't get directions.) I participated in the improv classes the week those were held, and I would continue to attend should the opportunity to do so arise (or organize some myself).

## Review

### Notes

* Goal was to work on being more a part of the group.
* Had trouble with the personal project getting stuck. Taking a step back and evaluating the value of what you were struggling with is worth it.
* Think taking on more would be a good thing. Has leadership skills, but has fallen out of practice and thinks that it would be very helpul to try to bring that back.
* Great improvement with TDD
* Still wants to work at attaining more proficiency in ActiveRecord
* Still room to improve organization skill. Break things down. Set small, attainable goals.
