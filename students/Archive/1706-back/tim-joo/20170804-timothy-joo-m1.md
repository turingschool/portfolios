# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My goal was to learn the fundamentals of Ruby and Object oriented programming. I don't believe I'm completely successful in achieving my goal, but I've certainly come a lot closer than when I started.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with classes and conceptualizing how they communicate or call on each other for different behaviors. Classes are very fundamental to OOP so by not understanding classes, I had issues picking up the projects we were assigned.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I'd say Credit check because it was one that I was able to wrap my head around and figure out with some help. My least favorite would be Battleship due to no interaction pattern to act as a guide.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned which concepts in class I didn't fully understand. I figured out my areas of weakness and learned to work and practice with those concepts to get a better understanding.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned to be a bit more assertive about things that are established in the DTR meeting.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite gear up was the Strengthsfinder session. I've heard so many good things about strengthfinder and it's great to get an opportunity to work with staff who utilize it for professional growth. Least favorite? Don't think I had one.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I contributed to Turing by learning about each individual in our cohort. The Turing community is special because of it's members willingness to connect and work with our peers. Being actively engaged in learning about other people makes for a stronger community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Mentorship.
