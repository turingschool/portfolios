>* I felt like I learned a lot in this mod and took on features that I was initially not sure if I would be able to accomplish. This mod has helped to build my confidence as a developer and I am proud of some of my work.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
[https://github.com/yoasyo25/apicurious]
>* It was really cool to use the github api, since github is a site that we use everyday, and learn more about authentication and api consumption in the process.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
[https://github.com/bretfunk/rails_engine]
In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
>
>*  I learned a lot about using ActiveRecord and SQL quires and this was a really good project to learn about creating internal APIs.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/samanthagongora/turing_professionals)**
This is an app for Turing students to connect with one another post-graduation

>* I become more comfortable taking risks and finding external resources to get a feature that we had not been thought in class working.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/mdevoe12/youth_sports)**
This is an app that helps to connect athletes, coaches, and recruiters.
>* This was my first time working on an already started code base and I appreciated the opportunity to jump into an existing project and make good contributions to the app.
