## Areas of Growth

What did you struggle with most this module?


  I didn't find the MVC very intuitive.

  I really liked writing pure Ruby and abstracting into Rails was not a comfortable transition for me.

  A big hurdle was that I didn't innately grasp how SRP applies in the MVC. It took quite a while for me to stop seeing it as just one big mess and to start seeing each individual piece. And that made my life difficult; without understanding the responsibilities of each component, I couldn't grok the architecture overall.

  This is a challenge I think I'm going to keep running into - I want to understand the plot before I try understanding sentences and words. But the plot reveals itself through sentences and words. While I understand intellectually that just learning the mechanics and syntax will make it easier to understand the overall architecture, that's just not my first nature. So a big lesson for me this Mod was that I need to be mindful about the fact that (1) I'm working against the grain my natural inclinations, and to be kind to myself when things are clicking and (2) I need to actively put myself out of the comfort zone and into mechanics-land whenever I can.


  Relatedly: Troubleshooting continues to be a battle; as Sal said the other day, "Oh, you thought you knew what the problem was? That was your problem." Yes, that's my problem. I need to continue to cultivate curiosity about error messages (i.e."fascinating").

  I continue to feel a real aversion to any and everything front-end. I'm just going to give myself that permission for right now.

What areas did you grow in most this module?

  ActiveRecord initially put me off. But after spending some time sandboxing, I'm less intimidated. I'm having an easier time thinking in terms of tables and parsing how to access the outputs I want. I'm looking forward to doing more of that.

  I felt more comfortable working on my own in the second half of the Mod. I'm *not* an introvert and I have a hard time tunneling into problems on my own. But I think I started to strike a better balance of working solo and collaboratively in Little Shop.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/boveus/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project, use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

Role: Brandon and I paired the whole time on the Trips iterations.

Goal: Struggle through Sinatra? Struggle through not understanding the MVC at all?

The best part of this project for me was getting to the end and playing around with the analytics queries.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JunePaloma/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

description: Create an app to record your ideas. Host your app live on Heroku. Users can create, edit/update, show, and destroy only their own ideas.

Goal: I didn't have a goal for this project, which was probably a mistake. Job Tracker was such a deflating experience that I was just hoping to get the essentials out of the mini-project that I hadn't grasped up to then.

Reflection: All my projects up to and including the mini-project were total garbage fires. If I remember correctly, my feature tests were the only things I felt remotely ok about. Sometimes learning is ugly.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mimilettd/little_shop_of_funsies)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

description: In this project youâ€™ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

Role: I worked with Ricky on user MVC set-up and authentication, I worked alone on the earlier admin authorization stories, I worked with Mimi on fleshing out admin authorization for viewing orders, I worked mainly alone on analytics with help from Andy and Ricky.

This project went really well, I thought. (With the exception of my lack of styling contributions.) I finally started to feel comfortable with the MVC; building out the analytics with its own controller/PORO/view really helped me to understand how to move data through class methods across the app (which hadn't been making sense). And helped me understand how to present that information with only one instance variable in the view(!!!!!).  I don't feel like I can write an essay yet, but I feel better about writing paragraphs.  Building out the higher level controllers (like for Admin, Analytics / resources without models) helped concretize the role of the controller, and brought the flow of information through the App into sharper relief for me.

## C: Final Assessments

How did you do on written and timed independent?
Was this a representation of your best work?

I never feel like I'm doing my best work at Turing; I only ever feel like I'm barely not drowning. But, I had less water in my lungs during the final than I am accustomed to.

## D: Module Outcomes

This module was hard for me and I appreciated the 1:1 help from both of you. I felt very supported and didn't worry that I was going to fall through the cracks, which I think I easily could have if you weren't both so awesome :-) Thank you!

### Self-Assessed Outcome

I'd promote myself but if there is any extra work that you think would be helpful for me to complete before moving on, I'd be super receptive to that.

(PROMOTED, PROVISIONAL, RETAINED, or EXCUSED)
