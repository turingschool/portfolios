Areas of Emphasis

    <What did you set out to accomplish this module?>

    To continue learning what I don't know about computers.

    I was most excited to learn more ActiveRecord and to gain the tools for consuming APIs.

    I also wanted to make a point of working more independently; which didn't go super well. The notion of Programming Like God made a big impression on me and made me resent that I don't have better frontend skills.

A: Individual Work & Projects

    APIcurious (Optional)

        <Description>
        Consumption of GitHub API
        <Takeaways, your experience>
        This project went medium-well; definitely helped me conceptualize the process of hitting an endpoint, parsing the JSON, and wrapping the resulting data in ruby objects.


    Self Directed

        <Description>
        Feedback App
        <Takeaways, your experience>
        Not TDDing creates a bit of a mess. Aside from the MockAuth difficulties,  not having a better knowledge of CSS felt like a real obstacle.

B: Group Work & Projects

    Rales Engine

        <Description>
        Provision of API end points
        <Takeaways, your experience>
        This was fairly straight forward. Main take away was that we should have written more model tests.

    The Pivot

        <Description>
        Took the brownfield for a single tenant e-commerce site and pivoted it to become multi-tenant.
        <Takeaways, your experience>
        Definitely gained an appreciation for the trade-offs involved in architectural choices and the fact that sometimes there's not one good choice.

C. Gear Ups

    Link To Gear Up <3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

    Having trouble remembering specifics from the gear-ups, but I've mainly continued to ponder how to communicate about emotionally-charged topics in impersonal terms that don't shut down dialog. Listening is probably 80% of the work there. And 100% of listening recognizing the other person's experience as being their own.

D: Community Participation
Community Contribution Option

        <Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
Posse

        <Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
        We did essentially nothing of value.
        <Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
        I would prefer not to have posse time.
        <How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>
        I've been in touch with one of our mentors, and that's been useful.

Playing a Part

    <How else you've contributed to the community>
