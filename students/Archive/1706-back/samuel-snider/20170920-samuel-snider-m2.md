# (Your Name) - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to understand the elements of each lesson in this module. I think I have been successful at least in the basics of them (going back through my CFUs, there were few questions I had to look up). I was very committed to learning more about my machine, and setting it up for the most effcient clear workflow possible. I've practiced typing a half hour a day in addition to all of the practice I get coding. I rarely leave the keyboard with my fingers, but I still have a long way to go in learning vim, setting up my keyboard shortcuts, and setting up my bash profile and other 'helpers' on my system. I also set out to start working with some other languages on the side to stay versatile 

## Areas of Growth

I struggled most with how to manage my time toward the beginning of the module; what videos to watch, what concept to nail down, and how much time to devote to projects and homework. I feel more comfortable now towards the end of the mod in these areas, but no where near secure. I want to continue to grow in this area.

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really feel good about blogger, mix master and job tracker, though I was just following a tutorial for most of them. I feel that this is where I really started to learn what mod 2 is all about.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(description)
A sweet application with all the points and rewards you will ever need.

(your goal for the project)
Work on my understanding of rails routes and methods, and complex links.

(reflection on project)
I think the project went well, I devoted alot of time to a side project that I'm still developing, but I'm proud of how my website functions, and think it looks at least semi-decent.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mimilettd/little_shop_of_funsies)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(description)
A shop for all your onesie desires, with authentication and authorization, sales analytics, cart and order functionalities. Uses Custom routes and paperclip to to attach pictures to items.

(your goal and role in the project)
I developed the custom routes, orders, and their join table order items. I implemented paperclip to store picture as attachments on items.

(reflection on project)
I set out to have a project I was proud of. I'm very proud of my project, and worked extremely hard on it. I am very happy I got such a great group of students here to work with.

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
I think the written went well, I didn't really feel like I wasn't sure about any of the answers (except maybe RRC). The timed was kinda crazy, I got stuck and reset an hour in, just copying over my story one test. My joins table wasn't establishing a relationship for some reason. I was still able to finish with time to spare though. I think I really need to practice keeping a clear head in stressful situations
(was this a representation of your best work?)
Yes, the second time through the timed assessment and written went very well, and I felt like it was kind of 'light' compared to mod 1.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

(anything else you'd like to share about this module?)
I was really worried the first couple weeks, but now I'm realizing I was in a good spot then.

### Self-Assessed Outcome

(PROMOTED, PROVISIONAL, RETAINED, or EXCUSED)
Promoted- maybe a 'self inflicted' provisional developing more complex routes (with actions and methods), and practice with authorization and authentication.
