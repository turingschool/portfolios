# Samuel Snider - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> <What did you set out to accomplish this module?>
I wanted a good understanding of all the lessons in this module; some new, professional looking projects to add to my portfolio; and a expanding of my knowledge in a language other than ruby.
While I feel my css, and html understanding is where I would like it to be, I feel my understanding of javascript is lacking.

>* This module was very different from the other modules, and having to adventure out on my own with lots of concepts was daunting at first, but more rewarding once applied.

>* <Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* My implementation of the homepage functionality of github
>* I learned alot about using Faraday to make URL requests, and how to use data in those requests. The power of APIs was lost on me until I saw how much data is stored on github and the limitless science that could be applied to this data.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* Gods and Legends
>* Building a Postgresql database with Deities and Mythologies, establishing relationships and using api calls to look up books based on their characteristics.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Creating a API to simplify the Black Thursday project, and therefore making the data easy to get and manipulate for anyone.
>* This was my favorite project, I feel I really understand complex SQL and active record calls now.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Creating a multitenency upgrade for a brownfield project. Added features such as OAuth, new user roles, vendors, vendor item and order analytics, two factor password reset using twillio
>* I really learned so much about the importance of good testing techniques, and DRY as well as SRP code. It will save your co-workers more than a few headaches down the line.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
I think that I need to focus more in gear ups about solutions, and managable goals to be pusing for those solutions. Too often the high level stuff interests me and gets me thinking, but it stops before I arrive at an implementable, attainable attack plan for how to change things about myself or those around me.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* <Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

#### **Posse**
  >* We did code wars practice with Ruby and JS
  >* That we did stuff
  >* As much as could be expected

#### **Playing a Part**

> Tried to help out more, got a little bogged down this mod.
