# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to focus on getting here on time, communication, and ending the mod excelling at JavaScript. I wanted to get a good start on my Job Hunt. I would say I accomplished the punctuality and communication part of my Goal, though I do not believe I am as far along in JavaScript or my job search as I set out to be. I am going to make sure in the weeks following Turing I focus on getting to this Goal. I will do this by having a detailed schedule that I make sure I adhere to. 

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
[Pending based on requirements] Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
Code Organization and Refactoring
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed the extra hour I recieved to try to do a refactor.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I spent the hour re-organizing my code into different files, and small, resuable methods.
* What did you learn?
I learned that the refactor should always be coming- I should not wait until the end to tackle the bulk of it.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest challenge?
Technical vocabulary is something I understand, but haven't become fluent at when it comes to explaining technical concepts.
I am putting together a written study guide for practice acquiring this fluency.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked that I knew exactly where I needed improvement.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
The challenge is not 'solved' as of yet, and maybe it never will be; its something I will always be able to get better at. That being said, I will work at practicing applying my technical knowledge to communication in a technical interview.
* What did you learn?
Practice, practice, practice.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
A simple way to create, edit, and delete dom elements.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
We didn't really find simple solutions, since we didn't employ a framework or library other than jQuery.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked that we got the pieces working, and that some pieces were easier that they appeared to be- like the search bar.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
I learned all about JavaScript, being essentially brand new when I started this project. I learned more about using jQuery and AJAX. I learned all about express, and remembered how raw SQL queries work.
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I would spend more time planning the project in terms of file structure and organization, we got it done but it was rather unwieldy
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
It was enjoyable to divide and conquer work, and assist or switch with responsibilities as needed.
## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Starting to work with React was a very large challenge this module. I did power through it and now understand a lot of what was a foreign langauge to me at first. I feel far more confident with it now, and plan on continuing to build my proficiency with React over the coming weeks.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked the outcome, the persistence I had with it paid off and I feel much more confident with it at this time.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
There were many approaches I took to taking on React:   using a react tutorial, reviewing the lesson plan, ordering a react book off of Amazon, using experimentation and stack overflow. 
* What did you learn?
All about beginner React, and how to develop skills with a new library.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
growstuff

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
finding a problem I could solve- I tried Spree, Mastodon, Steam-Link-SDK, and our original repo before finding something I wanted to work on and had the ability to work on.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I found something. I am currently working on adding to the codebase

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed finally finding a site I wanted to and could contribute to.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
HAML, SDKs, and Rails projects.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
Katelyn pointed out that I have a tendency to breeze through the instructions, and not revisit them throughout. I am going to try to apply a 'slow-down, revisit' technique for any project or instruction that I receive on my job hunt.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I did enjoy it, I think the time to plan it should be scheduled closer together, and that it should happen more towards the beginning of the module. I enjoyed working with the FE students and think we gave a good presentation, and developed a good conversation with our audience.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I was bad about giving back to the lower modules this inning. I really was pretty overwhelmed with all the work we had and didn't leave nearly as much time as I wanted to pair with the lower modules.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Paired Programming.
Breaking down a problem.
TDD/B

## Professional Development
