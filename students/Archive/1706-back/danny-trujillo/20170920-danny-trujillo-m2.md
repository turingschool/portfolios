# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

    * I set out to accomplish a greater understanding of Rails. I definitely have learned a lot about how that
    framework works and how to push ruby online using rails. I was also successful in learning a lot of other
    helpful tools including capybara for testing and RSpec in general.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
    * I struggled the most with keeping up with all of the new information. Before Mod1 I had done a lot of preparation
    including the second shift program. This let me have a good head start which kept me a little ahead throughout the Mod. This mod was different in that it was all brand new. I definitely struggled to keep up and had to put in a
    lot more work. I learned to take the pre work extra seriously before Mod3 and to seek out help when needed. It is
    much better to ask someone about what's not making sense instead of trying to figure out on my own.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

    * My favorite project this mod was the gif generator. Since it was an independent project I was able to learn
    every aspect of what was going on. My least favorite project was probably bike share. I was pretty lost for most of
    it and didn't have the time to figure it all out before the project was due.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

    * I learned the most from my independent projects. I was able to put the pieces together of the MVC model and
    learned how to do model and feature tests throughout the projects. I also learned to properly timebox some things
    in order to be able to get through the projects.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?
    * The paired projects had a ton of material. I learned a lot about styling since my groups were definitely focused
    on making them presentable. I was also able to see how other people approached similar problems. This was helpful
    in gaining a deeper understanding of how things communicate across the application.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
    * My favorite gear up was the group think one. It was very well directed which spurred a meaningful conversation. It
    was also an interesting topic that is prevalent in most professional environments.

    * My least favorite was the empathy and privilege only because it felt very similar to one we had in Mod 1. I think it is an important topic and one that should be discussed, I just feel the conversations that were had were ones I had already been involved in previously.     

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

    * I think just being present and willing to help with any questions anyone had from Mod1. I could have been
    more proactive in that effort.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

    * Next mod I think it would be good to put myself as available for pairings with Mod1 and 2 students and to start
    attending more organized Turing meetups and events to get more involved with the community.
