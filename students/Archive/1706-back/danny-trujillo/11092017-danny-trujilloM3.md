# \<Danny Trujillo> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>
    * This module I was hoping to further my knowledge of building Rails applications. I wanted to understand more about tools that are able to be utilized such as serializers and decorators as well as gain knowledge about what APIs are how they are utilized. I was also hoping to gain a little understand of front end technologies that can be used in conjunction with Rails to build more displayable applications.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
    * A working mirror of a github profile by using the github api and reconstructing my own profile page.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
    * I thought this was a great introduction to what api's can be used for and how to access the information you need. I learned a great deal and was also able to learn some more about styling in order to get the page to look how I wanted it to.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>
    * This project was to be an online marketplace for a currently operating greenhouse. It allows users to create baskets of produce and purchase those. It also consumes the nutritionix api and allows for the display of nutrition info about certain categories of food.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
    * Timing was the biggest struggle for me. I had a much grander vision of serving up my data as an api and consuming with a technology I've never used before (react). While wasting a few days learning as much as i could about react and having to abandon that plan, I left myself with very little time to get a working application put together. I also ran into issues with the api i decided to consume. My takeaways are to have a much better plan that allows for success. Taking on too much without a proper schedule and plan leads to a not very successful project.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
    * This was a project that was an api creation to endpoints that were business intelligence for the data we were serving up.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
    * This was one of my most positive experiences here at Turing so far. I think it touched on many different important concepts and I was able to learn a lot about apis, ActiveRecord, and Rails applications in general.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>
    * This was a brownfield project that was for adding new functionality to an exising application while maintaining test data and existing databases.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
    * I found this project particularly challenging. I think a lot of the project was focused on maintaining old test data. I don't think that was supposed to be the goal and I found it frustrating that so much time was spent doing that. There was a very interesting piece that we worked on at the end which was consuming an api page with jquery. Unfortunately we were only able to spend the last afternoon with this piece.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()

    * The Gear ups this mod were interesting as always. The tragedy of the commons is a cool website that shows how segration occurs. It was a fascinating look at the tendencies of people even when they don't relize what they're doing. It was also a good demonstration of the need to be engaged in making changes if anything is going to be different.

## D: Community Participation


#### **Posse**
     * The posse was a good outlet to relax and also learn some interesting things. We had numerous show and tells as well as ways to meet mentors and and be engaged in the community.  

#### **Playing a Part**
    * I've tried to be available for anyone in lower mods that need assistance. I've been able to answer questions regarding past projects and explain different concepts to fellow students that are jsut learning the concepts.
