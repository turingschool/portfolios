# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

My biggest goal I set out for this module was to try and stay 2 steps ahead and to have a good understanding of database relationships and queries.
I felt that last module I was constantly behind so this module I got my jump start with rails during the week break between modules. I read through the curriculum
and did a few online tutorials to get a good grasp on fundamentals before we started. I believe I was successful with my approach because I would come into class and have
my understanding of how certain concepts worked, but then would get clarification during the lesson that day. This helped me feel more comfortable and gain more confidence
in what I was doing day to day.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled most with implementing migrations in Rails. I could draw the schema but wouldn't know how to reproduce that through the command line.
It wasn't too much of a struggle with a bit more practice. I would also a little hazy on how normalized a database needs to be. I'm unsure if it's best to have more normalized
data tables or normalize to a certain point then stop.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Job tracker was my favorite project this module. I felt as if that's when I felt comfortable using Rails. It gave me a complete grasp on the fundamentals of Rails and left me exploring other advanced scenarios in Rails.

My least favorite has been Little Shop. The only reason is I just feel a bit disconnected from it. My guess to why that may be is we've been trying to work more as if we weren't in the same room all the time, so responsibility for user stories were spread across the group members, as opposed to sitting in a room and knocking them out together. There are good learning lessons there, but it feels a bit underwhelming.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

The most valuable learning lesson I had during my independent projects was taking a user story, translating it into a test, and building the application through TDD. It's an awesome feeling to create an entire Rails application without opening a browser. I now have a firmer grasp on TDD and why it's important in Rails applications.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Git workflow and agile practices was the biggest take away this module. My confidence level is a complete 180 from the end of mod 1 to mod 2 using github and agile project
management tools as a channel to communicate with my team.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite gear up this module was the one lead by the mod 4 students, 'The Robots Are Coming'. I like being able to hear from others outside of the 1706 people and getting to know
other peers across all cohurts. I also love the discussion of AI and regulating it. Conversation around technology and society are important conversations to have as technology begins to take over more tasks that, as a society, we do day to day.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I volunteered to be on a Q/A panel for a Try Turing event. I remember doing Try Turing and having a lot of questions and it was felt good to reciprocate that back to people who are thinking of making a career change.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'm signed up to do a lightning talk for day 1 of the new module. I'm excited to give a talk on the first day because I hope to get the ball rolling for other peers in my cohort to get out in front of people outside our classroom and talk publicly.
