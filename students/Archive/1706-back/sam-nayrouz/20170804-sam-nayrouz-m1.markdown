Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to have a solid understanding of Ruby fundamentals in order to be
comfortable and have a solid foundation for future modules. I believe there are
still a few things I need to instill, like creating a hash within a hash, and
more practice with enumerable's. I'd also like to be more comfortable with seeing
code and understanding the interaction, as opposed to relying on a spec to
understand. All in all, I'm happy with what I've accomplished in mod 1, but I
know I'm going to do solid work between mods 1 and 2.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I found that my struggles arose from not enough repetition of a particular. For
example, I know what methods do and how they behave, but I would struggle realizing
which methods to use when implementing the code. I also struggled with TDD and
understanding how to translate TDD into implementation.

What I learned was to keep powering through my walls by utilizing my resources
or asking someone else to explain something to me. I found that people have their
own ways of remembering certain things, and that it's good for me to hear it from
someone else. I also learned that no software engineer is perfect and that I will
continue to struggle even when I'm employed. It's good to for me to write down what
I do know and work with that, and then utilize my resources to see what I can
learn to help me complete the task at hand.

Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was Battleship. It was exciting for me to sit and think about
all the possible outcomes of battleship, then write that into code. I felt that
during Battleship everything I learned in previous weeks, finally came together,
and it felt great. It was great hitting a wall and knowing exactly what was wrong
and utilizing the correct resources to overcome that wall.

My least favorite project was Enigma. I felt as if I wasn't fully capable of doing
it because my partner and I were struggling in the same areas. I actually enjoyed
breaking down the logic the most with Enigma, but it was still a struggle at that
point to implement it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that there are a lot of great available resources that have been paved
by earlier developers, to help me get the answer to the question I'm looking for.
I also felt as if whatever I was building was mine and it was my story to tell,
which was an exciting and motivating feeling.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I've learned how to communicate with both sides of the spectrum. I've also learned
how coding can motivate a team to work towards goals. One thing that's stood out
to me is that I'm the type of pair that want's to take control because I
immediately want to start a project and break it all down as soon as we get it.
Sometimes I need to slow down and do that with my pair so that we're on the same
page moving forward during testing and implementation.

Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite gear up was the one the mod 4 students put on, Coding Schools or Coding Fools.
It was a great conversation around why we're here, why employers may be hesitant
to hire a coding school grad, and the future of coding schools. I felt as if it
was very relevant to this moment in time and it helped me prepare for why an
employer may not want to hire a coding school grad and how to overcome that
objection.

My least favorite gear up Debugging the Gender Gap, and not because I don't believe
women are less superior then men. That's silly. They're a lot smarter than men.
I believe bringing up the topic of diversity in the work place is something no
one can ever truly understand unless they are a minority. Having been told I was
hired because I checked a few more boxes for HR made me feel like I wasn't good
enough for the job responsibilities. I thought the video was actually really great
in addressing the gender gap in tech, but I'm sure all females will say they want
to be hired because they're a qualified engineer, not a qualified woman engineer.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I gave a second lightning talk to follow up on Allison's professional development
course. The talk was about how to utilize Stack Overflow so that the employers
who use their recruiting tools notice you and your contributions. I think having
a great LinkedIn page is nice just to have, but as a software engineer, we have
a story to tell and Stack Overflow allows us to tell that story with their
job tools. I also dove into the similarities of the Turing community and the
Stack Overflow community. Many people consider SO a Q&A forum, but really it's a
community of engineers pulling together to help each other out. So once in a while,
try to contribute what you may know instead of just taking what's already there.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to give more lightning talks and work on my presentation skills in front
of the school. I haven't presented anything on over a year and I'd like to sharpen
those skills. I'd also like to volunteer on the weekends for Try Turing events.
That's where I knew I wanted to come to Turing, so now I want to give back.
