# Liam Barstad - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I wanted to completely hone in my professional skills and ability to be reliable. Although I had
difficulty with this early in the mod, by the end I felt like I was able to keep on top of my workflow, and comfortable

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Mix Master

* https://github.com/liambarstad/mix-master
* http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started

This was my first project using rails and heroku (to which it is currently deployed), and it helped me gain fluency navigating between routes, controllers, models, and views in rails. The most important thing I learned, however, was the method by which to test an app in RSpec and Capybara. This helped me immensely.

#### Gif Generator

* https://github.com/liambarstad/gif-generator
* http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project

For this project, named gif-generator, I learned how to authenticate users and admins in rails. I also learned a lot about activerecord and erb forms by incorporating the favorites table and functionality. I got my first taste of using APIs by integrating the GIPHY API. Lastly, I reviewed styling in HTML and CSS and added styling and accessibility to make a (relatively) complete website.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Bike Share

* https://github.com/boveus/bike-share
* https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

Creating this project showed me a lot about how to accomodate a git workflow for a larger group and how to partition time. Conceptually, it was also the first time that I tried my hand at activerecord methods and controller setup in Sinatra. This will very hopefully be the last time I ever have to set up a controller in Sinatra.

#### Umami

* https://github.com/dphilla/umami
* http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop

Umami is a one stop shop for all manner of salt and salt accessories. This project cemented my knowledge of authorization, complicated activerecord queries, and erb forms. As well, I got the opportunity to use materialize, implement APIs like Stripe, and use helper methods and before actions in the application controller.

## D: Professional Skills

I overhauled all aspects of my personal life. From my scheduling methods, sleep appropriation, study habits, and more. I also learned to analyze the kind of personal relationships that will distract me and inhibit my personal growth.

### Gear Up
#### Johari Window

* https://github.com/liambarstad/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md

I liked this gear up session the most because it provided me with a very insightful and detailed understanding of my performance in a team up to that point. There were many words that people used to describe me that I was pleasantly (and otherwise) surprised at. I felt good about the perspectives I gained.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### Posse Feedback

We didn't end up doing much in posses this inning at all. The only session where more than three people showed up was the first one of the mod, and that was mostly for introductions. That being said, I ended up playing cards with whoever did attend, and I would consider that my favorite part of the experience. The people I did end up playing cards with, however, were good connections that will benefit me throughout Turing.

#### Other Feedback

This module, I attended social gatherings, workshops, extracurricular Q&As, and generally felt like more of a part of the Turing community. Providing help for Mod 1 students on their Black Thursday projects also gave me a great sense of accomplishment and I felt rewarded for having been able to be useful.
