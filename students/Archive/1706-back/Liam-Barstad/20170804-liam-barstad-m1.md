# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  When I started off the mod, my goal was to become natural with the Ruby language,
syntax, and style. And, even though I usually only get 3s in those areas, I would say that I
generally succeeded. I can now reliably code in ruby, and use coding as an outlet for creativity.
I am now looking forward to next mod, and discovering the implementations and applications
(literally and figuratively) of ruby and database design.
  This module, I struggled most with professionalism, both with my code and with myself.
Reigning in my coding style from something like a shotgun to a ballpoint pen was difficult,
and a process that is in no way finished. Fortunately, I now feel as though I'm not
blowing holes in the canvas every time I try to paint something. Personally, I struggled
with being on time and punctual. This has been a recurring theme in my life, and I
finally decided that I, no matter what the circumstances, am not going to be that person any more.
I have been making progress, and I feel as though (and hope that) I will be a different
person by the end of this program.

## Projects

  My favorite project so far has definitely been Black Thursday. It is certainly
the project that I am most proud of. But that aside, my partner Aaron and implementing
the prompt itself taught me something very valuable. When trying to analyze information
from multiple different classes and sources of data, my tendency had always been to
consolidate a method that pulls information from all over into one class. If it got
too big, I would split it into helper methods, but then I would be left with a bunch
of methods with no clear purpose, operating inefficiently and in a way that would make
it difficult for myself or others to improve upon. What Black Thursday taught me was
the technique of splitting up the component parts of difficult and far reaching methods
into the classes that handle the appropriate data and have them communicate with each
other. It took me days to get Iteration 4 of Black Thursday completed, but after looking
at Aaron's code and the way he utilized this technique, I am proud to say that I got Iteration
5 to pass (just about) all tests within 6 hours of its conception. It is so much easier to keep
track of what a method does when you can look up every logical component by class, and
it runs faster too.
  My least favorite project was Battleship. I did enjoy creating it, but I didn't finish it.
I didn't know how to use the technique I outlined above, and I created long, daunting,
and indecipherable chains of helping methods.
  The projects that I completed myself gave me insights into my own personal work flow
and habits. In totality, I still feel like I need to work on allocating my time
appropriately. I have succeeded on individual projects this mod, but I have also
failed. And so, I look forward to the individual projects of next mod, so I can isolate
my problem areas and snuff them out.
  I learned the most from paired projects, and I would prefer them over individual
projects any day. My partner Aaron during Black Thursday, for example, taught me
how to use github satisfactorily. Hence, it now feels quick, easy, and natural to
make commits regularly and branch, push, pull, etc. In Enigma, I learned how not to
communicate effectively, and I made and observed mistakes that I have since drew wisdom
from.

## Community

  During Gear Up, when we were describing our strengths and our aspirations to peers,
I felt that I got better at articulating myself professionally. At first, it felt
awkward and forced. But, as it started to become more natural and fluid, I appreciated
the practice, and the opportunity to reaffirm my goals.
  I really didn't contribute enough to the Turing community this module. Next module,
I want to attend more school events and groups. I recognize that networking, and the
connections I make here, will contribute immensely to my career and my direction.
Participating in the community will also help me get the most out of the program, and,
being typically antisocial as I am, I need to learn to bounce ideas off of my peers.
