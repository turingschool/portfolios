# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I wanted to be able to build the basic components in a rails app, from memory, so that I could have enough freedom to play around with extra features/concepts at the end of mod2/beginning of mod 3.  I believe I was successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with ambition, when alone.  In mod 1, I would be working from 6/7am - 8/10pm everyday, but this mod, sometimes I'd get off around 4pm.  That freedom was deadly to me, but vital to learning about myself.  By the end of the mod (last 2 weeks), I had fixed this, and I'm back to my mod 1 self, where I have that work ethic again, but wow, it was difficult to work on unassigned stuff when I was a little burnt out from mod 1 and wanted some rest.  I had finished the required assignment, I understood what was going on, I wanted to go home and sleep.  Mod 3, I'm sure I'll continue my habits from the last few weeks of this mod/mod 1, but I'm also aware of my tendency to hang myself when given free time, and I'm better equipped to deal with it.  

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
favorite project: MADLIBS! I had a blast with madlibs, and I'm continuing to add to it.  My ideas tend to get a little ahead of my ability to implement, but this was the project that emphasized my need to slow it down, and focus on the task at hand.  In that respect, and it's inherent humor and entertainment value, I believe that project was successful, even if it wasn't the project I wanted to turn in, at the time.  
least favorite: job tracker - I don't think the concept was very interesting, and I'm not the type to be deterred by a difficult coding issue, but instead by the material.  In that respect, however, it taught me to come up with a way to keep it interesting, even if the subject made me want to gouge my eyes out.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
FOCUS! latch onto 1 big idea, and 2 smaller ideas, then implement those TO COMPLETION before diving into anything else

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Patience.  Working with others, in 4 person projects has taught me that different people have different speeds, at which they code/understand concepts, and I need to be patient and cooperative.  In bikeshare, Mike and Ash were a tad quicker to the draw on their ActiveRecord knowledge, and I had to be patient, and understand that it may take a bit for me before I got the hang of things.  Feeling like I wasn't contributing in that environment, dealing with that frustration, and then figuring out a solution to deal with it (breaking off/studying after we had all gone home/creating problems for myself to solve).  In little shop, I was on the other end of the spectrum, where I was quicker in the group, and had to temper frustration and learn patience in regards to other's not grabbing concepts/coming up with solutions at my rate.  It wasn't terribly significant (the rate), but enough to wear at you after a period of time together.  I had to remember that I was in that position with bike share not even 5 weeks ago, and I'm by no means an expert, and different people learn different things at different rates.  They may be teaching me in mod 3.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed the adjective one, Johari's window.  It was interesting to see the divide between what people thought of themselves, and how others saw them (myself included).  I think that's something that we all need, as a way to keep our realities in check.  While it's nerve wracking, I think it's one of the more vital gear ups we have here.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I helped out with a few mod 1's this semester, came in on Saturdays to go over their projects with them. I was posse leader, and while helping out with coding was an occasional contribution, more often than not, I was counseling them, or actually just listening, to their concerns, life problems, and difficulties they expressed.  I made sure that they always felt safe asking for help, and helped to pair them up with people who matched their personalities/coding type.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I want to be SAB rep!  I have a few ideas on how to better incorporate some of the feedback, our cohort has given, into the Turing environment.  I also want to continue being the person people can come to when they have issues, and I hope to do an awesome thing for Halloween!  (There's a full size skeleton at TJ Maxx I've had my eye on!)  In all seriousness though, I think the great thing about Turing is the companionship, and acceptance, that we all have a capacity for, is shown in spades here.  I'd like to be a part of that.  Oh! And I'm interested in finding out more about working with code for those with cognitive disabilities, etc.  I think that is something I'd like to pursue, and share with the class.
