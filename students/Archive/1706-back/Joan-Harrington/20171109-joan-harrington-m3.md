## Areas of Emphasis

* What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I had 1 goal in mind for this particular module, which was to find which area of programming I wanted to go into, and study it enthusiastically.  I believe I've accomplished that goal.  I love DBA work, and not only have I gotten in contact with a few mentors, in the field, I've started to study SQL in my own time, plan on reaching into Python over the break, and am thoroughly enjoying what I'm doing.
My next step is to format my final project, so that I can create separate schemas for each client submission, and the client can only see their database, no others.  I also would like to create a separate rails front end, so that the rails app,  I currently have, exclusively handles the JSON, similar to the structure when working with node.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

 **[APIcurious]() (Optional)**
* Consume an API, and mimic the site!
* I consumed the APIs of Github, Spotify, Twitter, and Google to practice.  I thought it was great practice, and gave me the freedom to explore a variety of types of APIs.  Most are still on my local - but I showed them to Cory

 **[Self Directed](https://github.com/sidewinder2020/Bike_Redux)**
* Used DataGrip to import a large (68 tables/5 schemas) database, and turn it into a clean 13 table/1 schema database, through the use of views/large queries.  Used raw SQL to query business intelligence analytics, and rails to build API endpoints.  Consumed with Jquery/JavaScript, AJAX calls, and Google Charts to present in an attractive manner.  Also, created custom rake tasks to seed the large db to heroku.
* My experience was great! I know it might not have followed the guidelines as closely as other projects, from within the cohort, but I learned alot about myself, my interests, JavaScript, and SQL.  This is probably the most interesting project I've worked on at Turing, and something I'd like to come back to and build on.  

## B: Group Work & Projects

 **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/sidewinder2020/rales_engine)**
* Build an API
* This project absolutely built my confidence.  I came into mod 3 a little unsure how I would do, but then this project solidified a few things I was shaky on.  I'll be honest, this project was 85%? me, but I didn't mind too much because it was the self-reassurance I needed.  My biggest enemy is anxiety, and this went a long way towards helping that out. Also, it's where my love story with SQL began... *sigh*

 **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
* Brownfield Project - turn a small 'Little Shop' into a multitenancy app
* This was the project that was hardest to get into.  There weren't a lot of opportunities to put our group's spin on it (which, to be fair, is much more reminiscent of real world scenarios), however that led a lack of morale, all around.  It would have been fine, had the project imparted more new concepts on us, however the challenge wasn't an essential component.  I understand the need for this type of project, I absolutely do, but I personally didn't take a lot away from the project.  The only thing that was reinforced was sometimes you are assigned something, and you aren't always going to be a fan.  You are not allowed to argue with your boss, you won't always 100% of the time like what your doing, but you do it anyway, and you do it well.  In that respect, I understand why we had a project like this, and I respect that decision, and I'm almost grateful.  But...our project was haunted

| **Queries** | 3 | N/A | N/A |
*only a 3 on queries for Rales Engine, b/c I left a map in one, and I should have refactored a bit more

## C. **Gear Ups**

* [Link To Gear Up]()
I believe the Gear Ups were essential this mod, as they were directed towards finding a job, which, I'm told, is the point of the program.  But in all honesty, setting up resumes, tips for reaching out cold, and setting up personal stories may, for others, be redundant, but I appreciated the singular aim that the gear ups seemed to represent this mod.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
 * SAB (and see below in 'Playing a Part')

#### **Posse**
  * Our posse went out for beer.
  * The beer.  And the people.
  * Actually, it did help.  I learned how to talk to someone, about code, without the code in front of me.  I'm not even kidding, this has been something I've struggled with, especially when explaining a higher level concept to a lower mod posse member.  I had to keep it engaging, understandable, and everyone's right when they say you have to understand a concept thoroughly in order to teach it.  I had to know what I could cut, how to break the core components down, and make it relatable.  I didn't even realize this had happened until one of my cohort mates made a comment about my ability to explain things, and how dramatically it's improved, and others agreed.

#### **Playing a Part**

* SAB - created pairing groupings - helped lower mods, and some of our own cohort, frequently (I'm often one of the first ones here @ 5/5:30am), and work as one of the support columns, emotionally, for the mod.
