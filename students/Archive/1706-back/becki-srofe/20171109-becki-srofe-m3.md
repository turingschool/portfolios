## Areas of Emphasis

> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>

This module I wanted to solidify what I learned in mod 2, learn how to build and consume API's, and most importantly gain confidence in my ability to enter the job search.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
>* \<Notes>

I feel like I met my goals. My resume is done and I have a few promising job leads, I am confident that I can get more. I have some studying to do over break and then I feel like I will be ready for interviews. The main goal of mod 3 is to build and consume API's and I feel very confident in my ability to do that. I also feel like I am leaving mod 3 with a much better understanding of what I am looking for in a job.
-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

I really enjoyed API curious. I am not very good at making the front end stuff and this project really forced me to dig into not only consuming an api, but making my page look a certain way. It was frustrating trying to get the api call to work, but once I got it, it was very rewarding. I was very proud of the way my github clone looked.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

I really enjoyed this project. I started it in mod2 and wanted to keep working on it but have never had the time. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish in the time that I had to work on it. It does almost everything that I planned on accomplishing for the time I was given and I learned how to send email through rails and monitor the performance with newrelic. I would like to continue working on this project.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

Rales engine really made me thing about not only Active Record and SQL but also about routes. My partner had a really solid understanding about routes and I learned a lot by working with him on this. I also discovered that I am much better at SQL than I am at active record. I worked really hard at learning SQL over break, so that was nice to know.



> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

This was the most frustrating project that I have worked on at Turing, but valuable. I learned a lot about how important it is to plan out your project before you start. We made some decisions that at the time seemed good, but we didn't fully think about how those decisions would effect other parts of our project and we ended up having some really late nights trying to fix those things. I also learned a lot about working with data that is already in production and how hard it is to change your schema without affecting that data.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>

Microagressions- While this gear up did get somewhat heated, I really enjoyed it. There were some valid points brought up that I had not thought about before. I enjoyed hearing about others had handled microagressions against them.

Tragedy of the Commons- I thought the simulations that we used in this was really interesting. This presented a concept that I had never thought about before. It made me feel like I was much more able to change things as only a single person.

Cold Outreach- I think this gearup was one of the most beneficial from all my time at turing. Cold outreach was not something that I was looking forward to doing and the individual feedback that I got from the mod 4 students was excellent. I left the gearup feeling confident in my ability use cold outreach to make connections.



## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

I was the posse lead for Vaughn posse.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>

  As a posse lead, I wanted to make sure that this time was valuable to everyone in the posse. We started by having everyone share projects that they had done from the early mod that they were proud of. Then we talked about what we wanted to get out the time. We decided that we wanted to use the posse time as a down time after coding all week. We played a board game every week. This led to a much needed break and a lot of community building. It also helped mod 1 and 2 to have someone to come to when they were stuck and I paired with my posse members on several occasions.


#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>

I volunteered as a TA at a Try Turing event and joined the Pahlka Civc Tech group.
