## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I didn't really know what to expect going in to this module, so I didn't have very specific
goals in mind when I started. I wanted to feel confident with all the material that I
was supposed to learn and develop a good ruby foundation. Knowing that this was going
to be a very demanding program, I wanted to set up a routine that I knew I would be
able to sustain for 7 months. I wanted to come out of mod 1 with a better idea of what
jobs are out there for software developers and just a better sense of the tech world in
general. Also, knowing that networking and connections would eventually be very important
to finding a job, and knowing that this is a weakness for me, I wanted to start getting
practice by getting to know people outside of class while at Turing.

I do feel I was successful at most of these things. I feel that I have learned most
of the ruby skills I am supposed to have learned at this point and I have also learned
how to figure things out for myself when I don't know something. I am not scared that
I am going to "break" my computer anymore. I also feel I have settled into a routine
that I feel I can manage, although it did take me a few weeks to get there. I have not
forced myself to meet new people quite as much as I had hoped and I will definitely try
to join some meetups or other groups next mod.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The thing that I struggled most with was being OK with struggling and trusting the
process. I am used to being able to figure things out pretty quickly and not
having to struggle too much. That was definitely not the case, especially for the
first couple of projects. For both Date Night and Complete Me I felt like I was
banging my head against the wall for days at a time and not getting it. That led
to a lot of anxiety that I wasn't going to finish the project and a lot of self
doubt about my own abilities. However, it always seemed to mostly come together at
the end. I also noticed that most people around me were banging their heads too,
so maybe it wasn't me, but just the way the program was designed. When I figured
this out, it helped reduce my anxiety; however, struggle and uncertainty are still
not something I feel good about and something I know I will have to continue working on.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My least favorite project was definitely Complete Me, followed by Date Night. I think
that I disliked Complete Me because I was kind of over working with nodes and trees and this
was another week of that on a harder level. I really struggled to wrap my head around the concept for
both of these projects and there were times in both projects, but especially Complete Me, that
I got completely stuck and had no idea what to do. I also thought I understood recursion after completing
Date Night and then found out that I didn't understand it nearly as well as I though I
did when trying to apply it recursion to Complete Me. Thinking that I understood recursion
was a huge win for me after completing Date Night, so it was a huge letdown when I realized
that I didn't really understand it nearly as much as I though I did.

My favorite project was Battleship followed by Black Thursday. I was initially excited about
Battleship because it did not involve nodes and traversing trees. It seemed like a much more
concrete problem to solve, and when I read through the spec I already had a strategy about how
I wanted to approach it. While I certainly struggled with different things during this project,
I felt like it was the first project where someone didn't have to walk me through a big chunk of
it and I never really hit a wall. It was the first project that I really felt ownership over
and that I had done it myself. I liked Black Thursday because it seemed like a very real
world problem and after some initial struggles, I felt like my partner and I really grasped
the concepts we needed to, and I felt confident that I could explain and defend why we made
all the decisions that we did, which was a nice feeling.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned how to use google and stack overflow when I got stuck. I learned to reach out
to others when I was so stuck that I didn't even know what to search for stack overflow.
I learned that it is important to communicate with classmates that are working on the
same problem and look at their code because I found it was easier to write code to solve the
problem the way I was thinking about it, then it was to try and read someone else's code and
figure out what they were thinking and what their approach was.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

The biggest thing that I learned was how I approach problems. It was really hard for me
to complete the DTR for the first paired project because I just didn't know enough about
myself as a developer to answer the questions we were supposed to answer. By working with
a partner who approaches problems in a completely different way then I do, it made it
very clear to me what my problem solving approach is and that is now something that I
can articulate to other partners.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was the developer identity classes on how to update social media
profiles. I liked it because finding a job when I graduate is something that is always
at the back of my mind and this was a great practical way to start setting myself up
for success. I have not really used linked in before and didn't have much of a profile,
and I never would have thought about creating a twitter or stack overflow account. I
thought the Gear Up provided lots of great advice on how to set up those sites.

My least favorite Gear Up was probably the first one on growth mindset. The only
reason for this is because I have been trained on growth mindset several times in
my previous job. It was however a great reminder.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I cleaned the kitchen when it was my turn and I was an active member of my posse.
However, I would say that most of my contributions were to my own class. I tried to
help out people when they were struggling with something that I thought I could help
with. While I did not plan any class gatherings, I did attend several, and I think
it helped build the community and camaraderie among members of our class. I was also
part of the Friday lunch roulette group and the board game group. Additionally, I
responded to almost all survey requests from instructors and SAB.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Next module I hope that I can help some mod 1 students in the same way that I was
given help this mod. I would also like to be more active in some of the Turing student
groups.
