# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I want to learn javascript and how front end and back ends interact.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

There were a lot of steps involved in the logic to get the color and actually change it.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was challenging but very doable, so it was satisfying.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I set up a good file structure and then pseudo coded what needed to happen and then just started doing one at a time. I looked up how to do some regex stuff.

* What did you learn?

I learned that I have a good problem solving process.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

My biggest challenge was the first question on finding the bug in the rails code.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked that even though I hadn't looked at ruby code in awhile I was able to figure out what was going on.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I just started looking through the code for stuff that didn't look right.

* What did you learn?

I learned that I actually know a lot more than I think I know.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The biggest challenge was trying to learn jquery at the same time as I was trying to build a project in jquery.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I think we just took it one card at a time. We worked together to set up a basic file structure and made some decisions on style things and then just did one card at a time.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was nice to know that I have the skills to build a thing when I have no idea how to do it when I started.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

jquery, node, express

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I think I would have spent a little more time learning jquery before jumping in and starting.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

Eddie and I were paired on a project in mod 3 so we were already used to working with each other. It was nice to have someone to problem solve with where I didn't have to explain all the code first.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Trying to get authentication to work was by far my biggest challenge.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I found some tutorials on different ways to do it and then picked one that I thought was doable. I would get so far and then get stuck and try something else. I eventually found something that I was able to make work, but it took me about a week.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I like that I got to design my own project and I gained a lot of confidence.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Auth0, react, knex

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

PokmonShowdown

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The biggest challenge was that I did not understand how the Pokemon game is played. Without understanding that, it was not possible to refactor the tests.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I asked my teammate who knows a lot about Pokemon to explain the rules of the game and the how different items and moves effect turn order.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was interesting to see what it is like to work on a codebase with people I don't know.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

eslint was the only new concept I learned about. Most of the new things that I learned were Pokemon content.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I received a lot of good feedback about the scope of my project and how to narrow it down and what should be done first before other things are attempted. I followed the advice and it made it easy to add features that would have gotten in the way if I would have tried to implement it all at once.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

In earlier mods, I was really looking forward to teaching a gear up, but when the time came I had so much other stuff that I was doing that I did not enjoy the process very much. I didn't have the time to put into it and it just seemed like one more thing to do. We had mostly mod 1 students in our session and I enjoyed teaching the class and talking about different experiences with them, but the actual process of trying to put the gear up together was not very enjoyable.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I was part of Pahlka group, an active member of my posse, and paired with lower mod students on several occasions. I think this is required part of the turing experience because we rely on the community to help with different issues at different times in our Turing journey. We need to continue that chain so that the students behind us have that support as well.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Obviously I will take with me the knowledge of how to write a rails app. I will also take with me a process driven problem solving approach. Most importantly I think I will take the confidence that I can learn a new language and solve problems that I might not know how to solve when I started.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
