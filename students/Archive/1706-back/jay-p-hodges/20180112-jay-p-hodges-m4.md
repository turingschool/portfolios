# B4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

My focus for this inning was to continue branching out from Ruby, hoping to add an additional number of skills to my resume before graduation. Between learning JavaScript throughout the mod, learning Docker as part of my capstone, as well as continuing to practice with Python, I feel as though I achieved that goal.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

  Same issue I seem to have pretty consistently on assessments. I managed to deploy the functionality that I wanted, but did not get as far into the refactoring process as I would have liked.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

  Honestly, it was undoubtedly the most fun assessment. As much as being a frontend developer wouldn't be my first choice, there is something that is just immensely gratifying with having the results of your programming be so obviously in your face like swapping between colors. It certainly beats watching green dots as your tests pass.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

  I went with my normal incremental approach, with essentially just creating a single monstrous function before breaking it down into more manageable parts.

* **What did you learn?**

  To continue practicing JavaScript so that my programming speed can continue to increase.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* **What was your biggest challenge?**

  My biggest issue was simply that I didn't remember enough of the basics, such as HTTP response codes and the 4 pillars of OOP.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

  I have been through a lot of technical interviews, it was pretty standard but helpful to get back in the flow of things.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

  Just attempt to be as thorough as possible, essentially the shotgun approach of providing as much detail as possible in an attempt to hit the points the interviewer wants.

* **What did you learn?**

  To remember to brush up on the basics for both programming and networking in order to be better prepared for interviews.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

  Overall just programming in JavaScript, it is such a different language than Ruby it was certainly a shock.  More specifically it was probably just doing CSS again to start. I clearly had not done it enough previously so I had to relearn a lot of it.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

  By continuing to work at it till I managed to finagle the thing into working.


* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

  That by the end I had an appreciation for JavaScript and what is possible using it.


* **What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?**

  Usage of asynchronicity in programming, the nuances between using fetch or jquery get, and how to manipulate the dom.

* **If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?**

  Being more aware of the different approaches you can take in JavaScript, and the tradeoffs between them.

* **What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?**

  Worked out great, since we both had different strengths and were able to help each other in different areas.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

  Just learning Docker overall. I certainly didn't have a good enough idea of what exactly function it performed before going into the project, so as I learned more about what docker can and can't do I had to adjust the goals.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

  Spending a lot of time watching videos and going through classes on Docker and Docker Swarm. There wasn't really much of a shortcut, in the end it was simply time spent that allowed me to continue working through issues.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

  The ability to try something new and step outside of my programming comfort zone.

* **What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?**

  Containerized code deployment, linux programming environments, and deployment options of node based projects.


## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* **What codebase did you contribute to?**

  The Ruby Gem Faker.

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

  Finding an approachable open source repository that I could make some form of meaningful contribution to.


* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

  To continue searching until I found something that I was able to contribute to.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

  Having to track down a comprehensive list of Princess Bride quotes.

* **What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?**

  Advantages to a well documented codebase, why you should organize you open issues, and the best ways to solicit assistance on an open source code base.


## Feedback

**What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?**

Honestly nothing is sticking out in my mind despite thinking this over a bit.

## Gear Up

**Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?**

It was an interesting experience. Due to everything else occurring there probably was not enough time assigned to it, but we still managed to put together an interesting presentation. The challenges were probably trying to carve out time to spend additional time working with my group in order to get it done at the same time as a lot of other things were going on. Presenting to the class and being able to discuss the subject matter with them was rewarding though.

## Community Involvement

**How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?**

By continuing to try to be a supportive and helpful member of my cohort and community. By helping when it was asked, and just being there when it was needed. I presume it is required because Turing is a community based organization where, in part because you really can't get through this course without the help and motivation of others.

## Going Forward

**What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?**

Basic programming principles that are transferable throughout technology, how to be a more effective member of a team, and how to best support those around me.

## Professional Development

* 30-day post-grad job search action plan: [Action Plan](https://gist.github.com/jayphodges/2171075f8f67e734b78e9f369fd8a422)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
