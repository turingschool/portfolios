# Jay P Hodges - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> **What did you set out to accomplish this module?**

> I set out to start trying to branch out from Ruby/Rails and start to try to apply my programming skills to other areas, as well as continuing to work on my foundational skills.

>* I thoroughly enjoyed most of the material this mod, as well as getting to try out some Python and hardware at the end of the mod. Learning JavaScript continues to be a struggle though, but I plan on spending a good portion of my break continuing to work through it.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/jayphodges/gothub) (Optional)**
>* **GotHub: A Github clone.**
>* Had several issues throughout, I had initially started with a Reddit clone that I was unable to manage to get to work, so I went with github. It was an interesting in applying the OAuth, but the project overall was unfinished.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/jayphodges/network_monitor)**
>* **RubyPyMon**: A remote network monitor utilizing a Rasberry Pi running a Python script on that pinged several hosts and uploaded the data to RabbitMQ, which was then accessed by a Rails front end to display the data.
>* I enjoyed making the project, learning Python definitely added a bit of interesting challenge as well as enjoying working with actual hardware. I plan on continuing to refine the project as I go on.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/jayphodges/rails_engine)**
>* **Rails Engine**: API based ORM
>* I enjoyed this project for the additional practice with ActiveRecord and rails, as well as enjoying making my first API.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/jayphodges/the_pivot)**
>* **The Pivot**: A multi-tenant Music Shop with multiple admin levels to administer storefronts.
>* It actually was an interesting experience through all the requirements for this project. Luckily the group was good and worked incredibly well together so we were able to get through most of it without incidence.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
> The gear ups this mod were certainly interesting and thought provoking. It definitely made me reconsider a lot of things. Also, the mod 4 lead gear up I attended on learning an additional programming language was helpful in determining what I want to learn.
## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Primarily attempting to be an active member of the community and assisting and pairing wherever I can be helpful.

#### **Posse**
  >* For the most part we just discussed our week and assisted each other with things that were blocking our progress and trying to be supportive.
