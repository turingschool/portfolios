## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

For my first module at Turing I started out with a pretty simple goal, to feel comfortable programming. I have played around with programming for years in various ways, but always felt like a caveman with fire as opposed to any sense of competence. At this point I have both helped to create, and created myself, a number of complex programs that have greatly increased my confidence in my programming abilities. Moving forward I feel I am completely capable of creating programs of ever increasing complexity.


**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**

I struggled the most with what was essentially “not knowing enough.” Clearly it was by design that when a project is assigned you generally don't know enough offhand to complete it, and have to work towards a full understanding in order to complete the project. I definitely struggled with the initial hump on most of the projects, since I tend to want to have a full understanding of something before I work on it. I have had to get used to pushing forward with what I can do and knowing I'll work my way toward the rest.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

Favorite projects from this module were BattleShip and BlackThursday. BlackThursday was enjoyable because it was a well structured project that slowly increased in complexity as you progressed through the iterations. It started off relatively simply, but by the end it was a giant project with a lot of working between classes in order to find information, with a clear real world purpose. BattleShip was my second favorite in part because it followed by least favorite project, CompleteMe. I enjoyed how BattleShip, while relatively straight forward, had a wide variety of ways it could be implemented, with advantages and disadvantages to each technique. CompleteMe was my least favorite due to the inherent complexity of recursive functions, trying to wrap my mind around them was a challenge throughout the project.


**What did you learn from your independent projects?**

Time management and effective googling of programming questions. Clearly, also a lot of Ruby.


**What did you learn from your paired projects?**

How to work with different programming styles and how to effectively split work between a team.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**

Least: working styles
Most: community gearup

I would have to say my favorite gear up was the last one presented by fourth mod students. It was a discussion based gear up that they were able to drive very well by dividing themselves between the groups. My least favorite would probably have to be the one about working styles. It just felt a bit odd having to divide everyone by social ability, and made the following conversations a bit awkward.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

I did my best to be supportive and uplifting to those that needed it, although I did definitely start the module out of my element. That paired with the fact that I just didn't start wildly confident in my coding abilities. In my prior job I was generally the one teaching and fielding question, and I just didn't feel capable of doing that for much of this module. At this point I am glad to have come a long way in both being able to ask questions, and to be able to answer them.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I would like to continue putting more and more time and effort to being a productive and helpful member of the Turing community. Doing my best to assist not only those in my cohort, but all of Turing.
