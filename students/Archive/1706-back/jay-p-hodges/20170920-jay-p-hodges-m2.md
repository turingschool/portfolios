# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

To create an actual web application, and to combine what I know about ruby with what I learned of HTML and CSS in order to create a compelling and interesting app. Also, to continue to strengthen my foundational skills.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**

Just with trying to learn so many different things at once, ActiveRecord, CSS, HTML, rails, routes, controllers, etc.. I just learned to continue focusing on spending additional time practicing, and ensuring I am touching a number of concepts when I practice.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

Most favorite: Little Shop

Least favorite: Bike share

Little shop I enjoyed because we were finally able to bring all of the skills we used and apply them to a full project. The size of the project allowed the entire group to touch upon everything and really served to bring everything we have learned this mod together.  The least favorite was Bike Share primarily because I simply didn't much enjoy just how brutally manual Sinatra is. It almost seemed unnecessarily complicated.

**What did you learn from your independent projects?**

Rails basics, essentially just how much you can do with just executing a few commands. Actually though, independent projects definitely helped push my programming skill by forcing me to make things work and the ability to try a variety of techniques to solve problems.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?**

The group projects definitely helped me strengthen most of my skills. There was so many things to learn this module that being exposed to the tools and techniques that other people had discovered was incredibly interesting. As well as enjoying being able to share the things that I discovered.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**

My least favorite was probably the one regarding the Agile programming manifesto. It was an interesting concept, but it seemed the emphasis might have been in the wrong areas. My favorite was probably the johari window. You do not normally get that much insight into how other people see you, and getting an opportunity to do that was enlightening.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

By doing my best to be a good community member and contribute where I could.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I feel as though would continue benefiting focusing on some of the things that we went over the mod. I would like to continue working on the skills we learned and be better prepared to help the lower mods.
