-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/mikeyduece/api_curious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description> Consume GitHub API and attempt to replicate site.
>* It was a lot of fun and very interesting. I definitely spent too much time
going down a rabbit hole on the commits to get the info I wanted. I think I was overthinking
it. And that I for sure need lots of practice in styling a page

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/mikeyduece/metube)**
>* My attempt at cloning Netflix with youtube videos(bc of copyright issues with distributing
copyrighted content)
>* I did some cool things, but I didn't come close to doing everything that I wanted.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/mikeyduece/rails_engine)**
>* Black Thursday on rails.
>* I had a lot of fun with this. Especially bc I got to work with a friend of
mine and I was able to finally use AJAX to make a call on one of my internal api's.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/JunePaloma/pivot_project)**
>* Brownfield project, adding on to previous inning's LittleShop project
>* This was interesting. Definitely makes one think about the initial setup of
a project

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/katiekeel/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1710-inning/group_five.md)
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>
I love this. This is something that I still struggle with. I have an insane fear of rejection and even though I'm not going to meet many of the
people that I may reach out to, I still get a pit in my stomach about it. It was
very informative and led by my friends which made it alot easier to participate.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
I wrote a blog post and submitted it to my instructors for feedback/proofreading.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  LOL! What posse?! Lieterally no one showed up.
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  Other than hanging out with someone that I would be hanging out with anyway?
  Nothing.
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>
  Not at all.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>
  > I've tried to make myself available to lower mod students and any repeaters.
  As always, I could for sure do more.
