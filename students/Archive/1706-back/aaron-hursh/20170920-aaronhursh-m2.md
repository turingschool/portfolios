## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

	I wanted to build on the skills that I accumulated during my first module here at Turing. As far as technical skills are concerned, I wanted to use the foundation from Mod 1 to drive my exposure to rails and a detailed understanding of web applications. I came in understanding that Mod 2 would be more tutorial heavy and expecting to exercise less logic, but I wanted to maintain a broader perspective and not get too caught up in the specific memorization and syntax (though both are of course imporant). Linking the growth and experience of this mod with those of the first would allow me to emerge a more holistically driven programmer and - i think, at least - give me an experience that will better serve me moving forward. I think it took every day of these 6 weeks, but I do feel successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

	This being Turing, no experience is without struggle, and I experienced my fair share this module. I think the greatest struggle was in adjusting from the specific function like logic of the first mod to the more vague, serpentine logic of web-framework development. Error messages no longer explain the exact problem within the code. Procedural dev steps can so quickly and easily accelerate from the mundane to the onerous and even oppressive. From a practical standpoint, the tutorial heavy nature of the curriculum laid a sort of educational trap. I can see how easy it would be to go through the motions and feel successful while completely missing the actual learning and absorption that should take place, and I struggled regularly to keep myself from falling into that trap. Fortunately, as I now fully believe is generally the case, the struggles led to a great deal of growth. I developed a new and more nuanced sense for higher level logic - the kind at play in a web-app. I learned how to track down potential sources of error without necessarily having a test error to guide me. And finally (and perhaps most importantly), I developed self-accountability and learning and process skills that will be invaluable in my life and in teh dev world.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

	I enjoyed both of the group projects this mod, Bike Share, and Little Shop immensely. Because they utilized 4 person groups, I was able to develop group workflow and agile skills that I would not as vividly experience in a pair or alone. I also greatly enjoyed putting together products that have an actual end product that can actually be experienced outside of a command-line rake test. I think my least favorite project was probably blogger because it felt the most tutorial-like of all the tutorials. I should say that I don't think this is necessarily the fault of blogger as much as it is symptomatic of the task being our first real rails experience.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

	The individual projects (or tutorials) were my place to learn core syntax, tdd, and some nuance in the rails web framework, activerecord, and sql. For at least some of the mod it was often difficult to feel the growth, but as the module entered its final two weeks, I really feel like the work I had put in on the independent projects crystallized.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

	The paired projects were an experience that helped me to learn many of the same things that the independent projects did, but also some more general project management and strategic skills that I'm very excited about.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

	I really enjoyed the group think gear up as I felt it is an incredibly important subject and really enjoyed discussing the issue of groupthink with peers from my own mod and Mod 3. That said, my favorite gear up was the community (mod-4 lead) gear up on AI and automation. This has been a personal interest of mine for several years and I really enjoyed the discussion. I didn't really have a least favorite this mod - all the discussions I had seemed productive and worthwhile. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

	I made a concerted effort to aid the new and repeating mod 1 students this mod. I really enjoyed helping them work through problems and the challenge of helping them to learn. I think I participate honestly and productively and supportively in all my gear-up sessions and day-to-day Turing life. I think I have been able to offer support to my fellow students when needed.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

	I want to continue to offer my assistance and encouragement or support any time I feel it is needed. I would love to help people in the ways that I have been helped.
