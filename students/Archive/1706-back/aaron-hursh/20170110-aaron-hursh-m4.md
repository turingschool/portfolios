# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Wanted to get a really good handle on JavaScript basics, both on the front and back-end. Specifically, I wanted to learn JQuery, React, Node/Express, etc. More generally, want to prove to myself that I can learn new languages and apply my process to something completely foreign. 

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

I don't remember, but probably probably the part that required regex.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I really enjoyed the challenge of tackling a problem with JavaScript.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Fortunately I had spent a good amount of time working on process (for JS dev) during quantified self, so I felt like my approach was to simply follow the (albeit minor) convention I had picked up and work through the problem using that process.

* What did you learn?

Learned that I could write some JS that does a thing!

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest challenge?

I would say the biggest challenge is overcoming mental stress

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Really enjoyed the challenge and practicing interview techniques. I liked building the poker app architecture.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I just slowly ramped up and communicated heavily with Katelyn. I wanted to think out loud and explain how I think, instead of just spitting out an answer.

* What did you learn?

Learned how to communicate in an interview like setting.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Probably the filtering on the foods table.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Lots of googling and, more importantly, some really deep collaboration with my pair on the project, Brandon.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Really enjoyed diving into JavaScript and getting a feel for the different conventions.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Object Oriented JavaScript, Asynch JS, MVC in JS/Express

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

Not much on this project. I think things went really well. Might have done some wireframing, though.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

I really enjoyed the pair experience on this project. Brandon and I exclusively coded as a pair, and I think our understanding of JS and our finished product were both much better for it.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Learning an array of entirely new technologies while trying to build an effective product. Specifically, learning React-Native and Redux were the toughest parts.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I spent entire days only learning and not actually making any commits to my codebase. This really helped me avoid some of the pitfalls that come from jumping straight into things blind. I also just pushed through struggles and used repetition to build muscle/brain memory on things (especially with redux).

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

My favorite project thus far at turing. The freedom to explore new things and put your process to the test was just a massively rewarding experience. 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  React-native components (like flatlist)
  Redux (actions, reducers, types)
  Koa (specifically async await)

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

OpenFoodNetwork

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Getting a feel for HAML and CoffeeScript and the scope of a big Rails Project.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Just blunt force combined with process. Trying to track down the issue and not getting too hung up with things I didn't understand.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Thought it was a really nice challenge on tackling a huge, unfamiliar code-base. Felt great to successfully solve the problem.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Some minor haml and coffeescript, some exposure to angularjs, github contributions

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

Brandon gave me a lot of great feedback. He made some good suggestions about job-searching that I will definitely employ moving forward.

## Gear Up

I thought the Gear Up was really interesting. I learned a lot about open source, and really enjoyed helping other folks learn too. I enjoyed practicing teaching in front of a group and leading discussion.

## Community Involvement

I try to pair with folks that are having issues whenever I can. I helped with beryllium. Community involvement is so important because it allows us to give back. We have recieved so much help ourselves and it is important to see Turing as a community and be an active contributor ourselves.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Process, Growth-Mindset, Passion.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md): https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YW1odXJzaEBnbWFpbC5jb20

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
