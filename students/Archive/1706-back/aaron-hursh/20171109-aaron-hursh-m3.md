# Aaron Hursh - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> Technically, I wanted to become familiar with api creation and consumption, as well as push the boundaries of my skills by seeking out new and unfamiliar challenges. More generally, I wanted to continue to grow as a student and developer by continueing to cultivate a personal commmitment to a growth mindset and perseverence and dedication.

>* This module was a reall challenge but also an incredibly productive learning experience. I am now comfortable building and consuming APIs and, more importantly, have built skills that allow me to learn and deliver on new and unfamiliar areas with less support. I now know that I can approach a challenging and foreign topic, and work had to meet that challenge, and ultimately be successful.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* Mine was a github clone - an opportunity to work on consuming an external API.
>* API curious was really interesting as an introduction to API consumption. It was a challenge, not only in the backend consumption, but also in CSS practice.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I made an app called Citizen Sentinel that is a legislation tracker, consuming the propublica API. Users can follow issues and bills of their choosing and build a connection to the legislative process.
>* This was really a challenge, but also extremely rewarding. Technically, I learned a lot about API consumption, U/I design, and dev ops. Specifically, I had some really valuable learning experiences with the API consumption and its relation to site design and user experience: External data doesn't always organize the way you expect or would like, and this project was immensely valuable at teaching me to organize and manipulate external data in a productive and usefull way. I think even more valuable to me, though, was the experience of being wholly in charge of product design and experience of building expectations and the scope adjustments I had to make. My ability to understand scope and organize a project are much improved as a result of working through this project.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Myself and a partner built out various business intelligence endpoints.
>* I found this project to be both challenging and rewarding. I really enjoyed flexing logic skills via SQL and ActiveRecord for this. I thought this project went really well. Myself and my partner worked well together to produce a product that effectively delivered on exptectations and offer both of us a positive experience.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* This project was a brownfield code experience building on an existing little shop e-commerce platform.
>* This was perhaps one of the most challenging experiences I have had at Turing to date. The experience of brown-field code work and the simulation of real world experience was very different from anything else I have done to date. Consequently, It was also perhaps one of the most valuable learning experiences for me to date, both technically and in a more general sense. Technical highlights for me include user login and authorization organization, twilio implementation, and database management (non-destructive seed manipluation). More generally, the experience of site design and dev-ops were immensely valuable. Struggling with production bugginess tough me so much and I think has given me a really solid foundation to build on moving forward.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> My favorite gear ups were the parable of the polygon and the Mod-4 directed session on Block-chain. The former was a really powerful experience with visualizing cultural/societal bias and I felt that our discussions were very productive and enlightening. I also really enjoyed discussing the political and socio-economic implications of block-chain.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I really enjoyed pairing with students to help them through issues. I found that it was a clarifying and rewarding experience. I will aways deeply value the help and guidance I have received from more experienced students, and want to pass that along to anyone else I can.

#### **Posse**
  >* Our posse is very informal. We gather to discuss our projects and personal work, share ideas, and build relationships.
  >* I really enjoy passing along advice and guidance to folks in earlier mods in my posse. When I started, the upper mod students in my posse were not very involved, and I feel like our posse has done a really good job of changing that and helping to foster an inclusive and constuctive environment for new students.
  >* I have begun to build on mentorship skills and learned a lot from those in Mod 4 and front-end.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I try to make a concerted effort to be an active and positive force within the community. That has taken many forms, but I really enjoy helping others work through technical problems, building comradarie within the mod, and offering emotional support.
