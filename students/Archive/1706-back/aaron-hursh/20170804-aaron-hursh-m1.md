## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

When I began this mod, I had a few goals in mind. Specifically, I wanted to build a strong understanding of basic Ruby syntax and a readable and ordered style. I wanted to learn about how Ruby works, and in a more general sense how computers work. I wanted to test my logic skills. I wanted to explore my creativity and build effective projects that successfully meet expectations and execute tasks. All of these goals would fall under my umbrella goal - I wanted to push my limits and test myself, building on and replacing (if necessary) my existing understanding of the learning process. I think I was largely successful at meeting or making strong progress towards these goals. Specifically, my knowledge of ruby syntax and style has improved dramatically. I now have a basic understanding of how ruby works. I have been exercising logic skills to such a degree I would have thought impossible. Most of my projects have been successful, (I feel, at least). Finally, I have discovered a new way to learn by embracing struggle and doing my best to build a growth mindset.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Well I struggled consistently across the mod - but not in a bad way, for the most part, as each struggle brought with it immensely valuable growth, even if it didn't always seem like it at the time. Each project pushed me to the edge and I regularly felt like an imposter. But when gifted perspective, looking back at those struggles, I am able to see all the growth that came of them. I can see the evolution of my syntax/style skills, the development of my problem solving skills, and perhaps most importantly, a personal character growth that I cherish. Far and away the biggest struggle for me was Battleship. I made some ill-advised design choices early on that crippled my ability to address basic functionality and organization. I poured a week of my life into the uncooperative little thing and came up short. At the time it was devastating. But with time - just as I experienced with lesser struggles this mod, I was able to appreciate the experience for what it was - a learning experience. I feel like I emerged from that struggle stronger technically but also personally.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects were Date Night and CompleteMe. I really enjoyed the (sometimes painful) process of wrapping my head around abstract concepts and developing concrete logic and code that was representative of those concepts. I also have enjoyed parts of Black Thursday for its structure and more comprehensive/expansive scope. My least favorite project, if I had to choose one, would be Battleship - not because I struggled, but because the REPL made TDD difficult and I have somehow grown to really enjoy writing tests (well played, instructors).

What did you learn from your independent projects?

My personal projects were the foundation of much of my growth this mod. I think I developed a decent understanding of syntax and style as well as improved logic/problem solving skills. I learned how to be self-sufficient and push through difficulties and feelings of cognitive isolation.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Paired projects were education in the same way independent projects were, but with the added experience of collaborative development and all the complexities that are involved. I learned to be flexible and how to work together to leverage strengths and cover for weaknesses. I did much of my version control learning on these, too.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear up was the first, on growth mindset. I think it laid the foundation for an attitude that is essential in this industry and personal development and life in general. I had not been exposed to the idea prior to coming to Turing, and I wish I had been told about it many years ago. It resonated with me strongly and I am a bit of a growth mindset evangelist now. I didn't have a least favorite Gear up - I got something out of each session. I did struggle with the story telling gear up as I was suprised to learn that I am not very good a telling my story. That said, i didn't dislike the session at all. Rather, I found it illuminating and now know just what I need to practice.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I think I was supportive of my fellow Mod 1 BE students and always willing to help with technical or personal issues. I have built relationships with students from other mods and hope that I have had a positive impact. I have participated in my Posse and helped to give it some direction.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Next mod I would like to continue to be a resource for fellow students, just as I depend on them for guidance and help. I would especially like to offer pairing help to incoming Mod1 students and make them feel supported and welcomed in the community.
