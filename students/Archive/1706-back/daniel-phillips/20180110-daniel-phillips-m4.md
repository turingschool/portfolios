I received some great feedback on my JS assessment.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I really loved developing this session. Teaching is really fun, and it was great to have chance to do this in a new context.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I worked with several Mod1 students this mod, which was really fun and interesting.

## Going Forward

1) finish my capstone
2) be the best Junior Developer EVER.
