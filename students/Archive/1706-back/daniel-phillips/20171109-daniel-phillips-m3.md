>* \ One of the biggest takeaways for me this module was learning the fact
that there are problems to be solved and the most important skill I can develop
is my own process in solving problems. Josh really drove this home in the first
week or two when he talked about how "no one is going to pay you to follow
a tutorial", and that people will pay you to solve real problems that they have.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\The cold outreach gearup was excellent. Katie, Jimmy, Ellen, and Des did an amazing job of engaging and walking people throught their processes for outreach

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \lead posse spike session for the mod1 students on hashes.

#### **Posse**
  >* \Golick Posse was pretty low-key, used time for working with lower mod students often
  >* \Highlight was definitely having Regis come in to talk about contributing to open-source
  >* \The Turing Alums in the posse's have been a huge help

#### **Playing a Part**

> \ This mod, I spent more time helping mod1 students, there were 2 students I
met with on a regular basis from around week 3 to 5. I felt like it was a good
experience, not only because I felt like I helped them, but it also helped to
solidify what I know about those concepts.
