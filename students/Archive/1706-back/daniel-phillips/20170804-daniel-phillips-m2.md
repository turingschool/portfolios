# Daniel Phillips - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn the fundamentals of building web apps with
Sinatra and Rails, and to learn as much about working in Ruby Web Frameworks
as possible.

## Areas of Growth

I really struggled this module. Mostly, this was in the area of time-management.
These struggles really came to a head with some family issues that arose
early in the module, and with getting sick over the weekend before
and into week 5. These factors really challenged my ability to put in the
time to focus on each of the incremental things we we're learning, and added
a lot of extra stress to an already intense schedule.  

I think I grew in terms of my ability to learn and solve things on my own (and
with by developing my google-fu). I think that the cycling through of tutorials
really helped to force me to really reckon with my ability to ensure that
I learned things and to fully realize the steps I need to take to get myself to
the point where I felt comfortable (enough) with a certain topic.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiekeel/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Sinatra app analyzing bike share data.

Goal: Contribute effectively and learn how to work with Agile Workflow

I felt really good about my work on this project. I felt like I really had
the opportunity to deep dive on ActiveRecord queries on this project.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dphilla/net_work)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

An app for keeping track of networking contacts when growing a professional
network.

Goal: build out a rails project with more associations and queries than I used in the
past. Also, use this as an opportunity to get better with styling.

I was sick for much my available worktime on this project,
so, I tried, but I did not get a lot done--not even close to what I
had planned to get done. This was the most frustrating part of this
module for me, mostly because of the circumstances and how far I felt like it put
my learning behind.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/swdonovan/scoots_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

An online Scooter Shop

Goal: to really get comfortable with some of the newer topics, Mostly
sessions, building a cart, namespacing routes, etc.

I felt like by the time this project started, I was already behind in class.
This affected how well I felt like I was contributing, but by the end I felt like
I was contributing more and I felt happy with my work with my team, by the end.

-----------------------

## C: Final Assessments

I did fine on the written assessment, mostly because I feel like I generally
have a grasp on the theoretical topics that we've been covering in class.

The independent assessment was not my greatest work. I think my poor showing
here was a reflection of my priorities in the last few weeks. I have felt
behind for a few weeks and was behind on the Mini-Project, so I feel like
a lot of my focus has been on making myself really familiar with rails-specific
topics: routes, route, form, and link helpers methods, Authentication
and Authorization, building a cart, and understanding and
getting comfortable with syntax and Test-Driving those issues.

This left some bigger gaps with ActiveRecord associations and query methods,
both of which I felt like I was starting to have a better grasp on in the
beginning of the mod, but then fell off after the focus had shifted.

This was not my best work, and I feel like I could review ActiveRecord
query methods, and SQL, much more.

-----------------------

## D: Module Outcomes

Because of the some of the presses on my time, I really felt like I fell behind
this module. I was not where I intended to be by week 6. While I still feel like
I learned a ton, I didn't land where I wanted to.  

### Self-Assessed Outcome

PROVISIONAL or RETAINED (Honestly, not sure which would help me more)
