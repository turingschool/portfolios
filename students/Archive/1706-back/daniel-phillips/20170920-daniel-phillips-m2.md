## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn the fundamentals of building web apps with
Sinatra and Rails, and to learn as much about working in Ruby Web Frameworks
as possible.

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I think I grew in terms of my ability to learn and solve things on my own (and
with by developing my google-fu). I think that the cycling through of tutorials
really helped to force me to really reckon with my ability to ensure that
I learned things and to fully realize the steps I need to take to get myself to
the point where I felt comfortable (enough) with a certain topic.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I probably struggled most with negotiating certain aspects of group dynamics as pm on little shop. The most valuable
lesson from this is probably when to let things go and when to address things.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Miniproject! Great to have time to devote time to working on your own idea.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

How I tend to understimate the time certain features will take to build.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I like the GroupThink Gear up. Lots of widely applicable ideas there.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I spent a lot more time helping mod1 students this mod than I have any other mod, which has been a great opportunity
to get to know people in other coohorts.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Get more involved in posse-related activities.
