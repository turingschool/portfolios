# B4 Portfolio Brandon Stewart

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I hoped to have a good understanding of the DOM and JS.  I accomplished this and also learned new tools such as React.  I feel much more comfortable with front-end technologies now and would be comfortable working with them in the future.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
The JS assessment went pretty well. The biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to pull out all of the individual words from the file.  I feel like the regex that replaces all the non-letters with spaces worked pretty well.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
It was challenging and scoped in a way that made it doable in 3 hours. I feel like the objective and problems to solve were clear.  
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I did an iterative approach using console logs to build out functionality one piece at a time. I feel like this was a pretty productive approach.
* What did you learn?
I learned that text input sanitization is really difficult.  Regex makes it easy to do, but they are kind of hard to implement.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
It was difficult to stay focused during the object oriented example using the elevator.  I kind of felt like I was a little all over the place.  Without code it is hard to talk about something like that, but I think I did well.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I like that it was like a real interview.  I enjoyed the challenge.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I do interview prep on my own now and then to think through potential interview problems.  I feel like the preparation was key.
* What did you learn?
I got a lot out of discussing the elevator problem.  I appreciated thinking through that sort of problem with another person.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Getting the rows to sort using a regex in JS.  It was very challenging, but I feel like we had a really good solution at the end of the day.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Aaron and I paired on it and threw a bunch of ideas out.  We finally figured out the regex approach that was really good.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed that it reinforced the concepts of the DOM and how to manipulate it.  I felt a lot stronger with JS after the challenge.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Manipulating the DOM, using object oriented JS with ES6, using the CSS grid system, adding dynamic CSS to improve user experience.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I feel like me and Aaron paired a lot, but it was a good thing in the end.  I think we might have been able to pair a bit less, though.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
It was great.  Aaron and I work together really well.  

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Getting a handle on organizing a react app was difficult, but doable.  The hardest part was handling SVGs and making them behave in an actual random way.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I did another iterative approach.  Once I got them to display on the page, I just kept adding them in until they behaved the way I hoped.  It was similar to a console.log approach, but instead of observing the console I was observing my app.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed that my app was more than a simple CRUD application.  It had some unique aspects that allowed me to be creative.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
I got a very good handle on how to deal with react and create an organized react app.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
https://github.com/openfoodfoundation

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Looking through Angular, Coffeescript, and HAML was very difficult.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Aaron and I just sort of figured it out.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I really gained confidence contributing to the open source repo.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Angular isn't so bad.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I appreciated that Lauren motivated me to work on my original idea for the capstone to push myself rather than improve one of my old projects.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I really enjoyed doing it.  I feel like it was a meaningful experience for everyone.  I wrote a ruby script to randomize some output.  It turns out the .sample method is not very random at all, but it made for a really fun experience.

I also think our ice breaker went really well and people were very engaged.  I may use that technique in the future.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I participated in the Pahlka civic tech group.  I lead my posse and provided a lot of mentorship to the folks in my posse.

I helped several mod 2 and mod 3 students with projects and troubleshooting here and there throughout my mod.

I mostly lead the community gearup my group gave.  

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

An appreciation for DOM manipulation
JS fundamentals
Technical interview abilities


## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
