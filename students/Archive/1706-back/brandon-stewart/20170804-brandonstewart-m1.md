# Brandon Stewart - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

- I wanted to gain a solid foundation for ruby programming and understand
Object Oriented programming principles very well.  I feel like I succeeded
in both of these goals.  I also succeeded in a goal that I did not set out to
achieve at the start of the program which was to become better at working
with other programmers.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

- I struggled with the idea that I don't have to finish everything and that there
will always be more work to be done, so I have to intentionally take time off
and make time for myself.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

- My favorite projects were jungle beat, date night, and complete me.  I really
enjoyed the challenge of creating a mental model of a data structure and implementing
it.  I didn't enjoy battleship as much since the idea of what a Battleship game
was already clear, so it was just a matter of organizing my code.  I had to
think about how to organize the code, but there wasn't that element of mapping
out a data structure or something similar in my head.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- I learned the value my time and got an idea of how I can best structure my
free time and work time to achieve optimal results.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

- I learned how to think through a problem with someone.  I also learned that
code will become cleaner through a paired work session since both people have
to understand it.  I also learned much more about git and github and their
workflows by using it with my pairing partner.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite gear up was the video about debugging the gender gap.  I feel like
we could have had more time for discussion, but I enjoyed the video.

My least favorite gear up was about introversion vs extroversion.  I really
enjoy the concepts by themselves, but I don't think that the conversation was
as in depth as we could have gone.  Having 5 minutes to discuss things like
how introverts and extroverts have behaved in turing and our lives in general
seemed like too big of a scope for the conversation.  I feel like this gearup
could have had a more specific scope to guide the conversation in a particular
direction.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I gave a lightning talk for my class and have mentored a few people who are
starting 1708 BE.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I am greatly looking forward to mentoring 1708 BE folks and providing them advice
and help with object oriented programming principles and helping them figure
things out.
