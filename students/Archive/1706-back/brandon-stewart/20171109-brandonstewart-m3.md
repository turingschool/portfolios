>* \I became much more comfortable writing a robust, well-tested, and DRY application.  I also became much more familiar with how to apply concepts such as DRY, LoD, and SRP in a practical way.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/boveus/APIcurious) (Optional)**
>* \ I ingested the Spotify API to get a user's top 20 songs, top 20 artists, and get the beginnings of a playlist generation thing.  I may pick up on this project and finish it.
>* \ APIs are hard to consume.  It really gave me an appreciation for how to use service objects when consuming an API.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/Turing-Civic-Tech/pahlka_organization)**
>* \I ingested the GitHub API to pull out various information about a GitHub organization.
>* \It was interesting using a background worker and deploying the redis background worker to Heroku. I also learned how to use google charts pretty well.  Overall it was fun making a useful app using the knowledge I gained consuming APIs.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/boveus/rales-engine)**
>* \We created API endpoints and used ActiveRecord extensively.
>* \This really solidified my understanding of ActiveRecord and made me more confident using AR in general.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/boveus/umami-brownfield)**
>* \This was an app that added multi-tenancy to an existing web application.
>* \I learned that it is hard to work on brownfield projects.

> Evaluation comments:
\I don't have anything to add beyond what was already discussed during my evaluations.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\I don't have links to specific gearups.  Overall, the most impact the gearups had for me were the things that were more specific and actionable.  I got a lot out of the job tracking idea using Trello.  I have a job tracking Trello board that is very useful.  I also thought that the resume/elevator speech session was great and would like to see more of those.  

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \I presented a 1 hour spike during posse time about git/github workflow for M1 students.  I also paired regularly with M1/M2 students to help with Ruby / Rails stuff.  I made a single open source contribution to a security resources repo (https://github.com/vitalysim/Awesome-Hacking-Resources)

#### **Posse**
  >* \I lead the git spike and also got two mentors to come and offer career advice to my posse.
  >* \I enjoyed the (minority) of people who were engaged in the posse, but for the most part people were not engaged and it was concerted effort to get people engaged.
  >* \I learned a lot about organizing a group, since I became the posse lead.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \I have been involved in the Turing Civic Tech student group.  I made my personal project for that student group and it should give us a good foundation for actually being involved in civic tech.  I really enjoy the self-organizing aspect of the group and how everyone involved is actively engaged.  I feel like this sort of student experience that I hoped posses would be like.
