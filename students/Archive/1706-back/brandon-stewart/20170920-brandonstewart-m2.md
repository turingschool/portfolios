## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to gain a good enough understanding of rails and web development in general to be able to create a web page using rails.  I wanted to understand HTML and rails web applications well enough to design them on my own.  I feel like I was successful in this goal and feel very comfortable in doing these tasks in the future.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled initially with a lot of the material since I wanted to understand everything that was going on with rails and web applications in general instead of just memorizing things.  This required a steeper learning curve and I didn't feel like I had a good grasp on things until about week 4.  It would have been easier to understand things holistically had I not attempted to understand each individual part in depth and instead learned how the whole was working before going in depth for each component.

 I eventually learned how things were working holistically, but I think that it took me longer than it should have.  There was a side benefit to this that I feel like I have a greater understanding of the entire web application now that I dug into each component in depth.  I am not sure if I would repeat this approach to learning if I were to do it again since there seems to be pros and cons to it.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I didn't really enjoy bike share.  I felt like learning Sinatra didn't benefit me in terms of understanding rails.  I also didn't feel like the concept of AGILE or what the role of the team's project manager was supposed to be were explained very well.  This resulted in unclear expectations for how AGILE workflow would work and what, exactly, the PM of the group was responsible for.  

My favorite assignment was probably the rails mini project.  I feel like I learned a lot from it, even though my project was incomplete.  I think that it would have benefitted me to scale back my goals so that I could have met the 3-4 day timeline for developing my project, but I appreciated the idea of coming up with my own project and specifications and implementing it.  I would have appreciated some sort of feedback on that project in particular since there were a few design decisions that were questionable.  This is partially on me since I didn't reach out to any instructors for help, but I was assuming we were going to do a project review like we did for other projects.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned about how to think about a database schema before you start you project and how to set yourself up for success later on.  This really came into light as I tried to manage the various relationships and pull data from them after I set up my schema.  I began to appreciate the AGILE approach to database development, since determining my entire schema before setting everything up lead to a lot of pain points later on.  If I were to do that project over again I probably would have gradually added columns and tables to my schema rather than set them all up from the beginning.

The other thing I learned from my personal project is that it doesn't particularly matter how efficient or well thought-out the backend of my website is when I am showing it to a small number of people.  While an especially bad backend can cause performance issues at scale, no one will really notice if the backend is not 100% optimized when giving a friend or family member a demo.  This is most likely not true when it comes to expanding to a large scale.  I would appreciate some sort of mechanism for testing our projects with scale, so that I can appreciate how those small performance modifications can positively impact my project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

My paired project solidified my understanding of git workflow.  I became much better at managing my git workflow with others.  I also became a lot less afraid of merge conflicts and have begun to embrace their inevitability rather than work to avoid them.

I learned a lot about how to deal with varying workstyles of other programmers.  I feel like I am pretty good at pairing in general, but pairing in a group of 4 people has its challenges.  The idea that you can't please all the people all of the time really came into perspective for me.  I began to understand that, if I make a decision, it won't necessarily be supported by an entire group, but that it is OK (and inevitable) that people disagree with my decisions.  There is a balance between compromise and sticking to your guns and it can be very difficult to strike, but I felt like I got a better understanding of how to do that.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My least favorite gear up was on AGILE.  I felt like this would have been a better discussion if it had focused on the principles of AGILE rather than the social issues and lack of diversity in the initial composition of the founders of the AGILE movement.  I didn't gain a better appreciation for AGILE after our discussion of it.

My favorite gearup was the Johari window gearup.  I feel like it was very valuable feedback and really facilitated us giving eachother feedback.  I think it would have been even more valuable if we had introduced it earlier in the program and had people give feedback to eachother in more regular intervals.  It would be even more interesting if we could see the progression and changes in how we are perceived over time.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I have paired with mod 1 students very regularly and have participated in two spikes.  One was on Git workflow and another was a live coding event that I assisted Mimi on.  Other than those formal sessions I have offered my time on dozens of occasions to pair with mod 1 students to help them with their projects.  I also paired with a mod 2 front end student for a rails project which we both got a lot out of.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to offer the next round of mod 2 and mod 1 students assistance with learning rails and learning ruby.  I would also like to offer spikes for mod 2 and mod 1 next round.  I feel like spikes can be very valuable, but it is difficult to find a time to actually give them.  I think it would be great if we could have a designated time for students giving spikes and allow students from throughout the school to sign up for and attend them.
