## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  One area that I wanted to work on was obtaining a feeling of confidence in myself. This isn't a problem that is exclusive to code, it is something that I struggle with in most areas of my life. I wanted to get to a point where i can actually tell people that I am a developer and not feel like I'm lying to them. I can say that while I did not accomplish this goal, I did make great strides in these last couple of weeks. Performing really well on a challenge was key in starting this snowball. From there I just had to remember that I needed to have a stronger positive self-narration.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

There were quite a few things that I struggled with this Mod, all of which had the common thread of being related to my personal life. The chief crises were that I had quit smoking after smoking for 10 years and became irritable, My boyfriend broke up with me on the first day of Mod 2 because I had spent too much time on school, and one of my good friends from home committed suicide in the middle of the Mod. Throughout all of this, I had many moments where I came so close to giving up. Rather than giving up though, I decided to throw myself into Turing and my learning. This provided me with a much needed distraction from my personal life. From all of this struggle I learned the value of having a skillset that I can devote myself to.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project was the rails mini project simply because of the freedom we had in designing our projects. This mini project gave me an opportunity to start working on something that I had wanted to work on. Having a grade attached to your personal project was great for me because it gave me additional extrinsic motivation to get it started.

  My least favorite project was bikeshare, and I want to stress that it was not because of my teammates in any way. Rather I still felt so new to web development that I constantly felt like I was a hindrance to my team. I ended up having to find creative ways in which I could contribute while also not getting in the way of the team as a whole. It was an interesting feeling that allowed me to learn about how to contribute when you're not an expert.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned that I have been craving a certain degree of creativity in projects. It was really refreshing that my instructors not only allowed us to design our own projects but they helped us shape them into something that satisfied the requirements of the project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned that I am a very easy person to pair with. The role I carved out for myself in both of my group projects was to be a sort of mediator. This was further supported by the fact that in both my teams I had the most strngths that correlated with the "relationship-builder" theme. I ended up becoming a bridge between everyone's different work styles and held our group together. In order to do this, I needed to be observant of everyone's ideas and emotions, to have strong active listening skills and then a strong skillset revolving around synthesizing ideas and paraphrasing them in a way that the audience would be able to digest.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite Gear Up was the GearUp revolving around empathy and privilege. I appreciate that I was able to learn something new about privilege, the lens in which we see our ancestors. It was also refreshing to see a discussion about privilege that didn't involve a privilege line.

  My least favorite was the discussions we had around feedback. There are two ideas present/absent in those discussions that really bothers me. The first is that there seems to be a presupposition that feedback will be required in every group/pairing. That is a dangerous assumption to make since I don't want to go looking for or simply fabricating flaws. The second is that there's no separation between technical feedback and interpersonal feedback. Technical feedback being feedback related to hard skills and interpersonal being related to soft skills. I can safely say that I am still not comfortable providing technical feedback, but I can provide interpersonal (yet there doesn't have to be a need for interpersonal feedback).

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I joined the LGBTuring slack channel as well as the latinx channel.
  I attended an LGBTuring meetup hosted here at turing.
  I volunteered to speak to high school students about the joys of coding.
  I am going to be volunteering at rocky mountain ruby.
  I met with a mentor and we discussed many different approaches to diversity advocacy.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to join SAB and represent our cohort. This is something that I would never have done while I was going to college or high school, which is why I want to do it now.

  I want to attend at least 3 meetups next mod.
