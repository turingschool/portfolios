-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description> APIcurious was a non graded project designed to make us comfortable with the process of consuming an API. I used this opportunity to learn about the github api.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience> I definitely remember having an a-ha! moment where the api consumption clicked. It was a very powerful moment because it essentially demystified api consumption. This is the most beneficial thing that I can do for my learning, demystifying something that seems so "magical". 

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description> The self-directed personal project was an opportunity to create a project from the ground up and implement an idea of your choosing. I decided to implement my idea of a digital business card. 
>* \<Takeaways, your experience> I definitly ended up with a great appreciation of front-end developers as having to style my own work was a bit of a challenge. I also learned alot about scope and what it takes to actually ship something. In a conversation with Cory, I came to understand that there is a sharp difference between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Without that solid understanding of the difference between the two, I would have been stuck in a phase of idea generation as opposed to actually implemented any of those ideas. This helped me stay focused on what was essential to getting the project off the ground. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description> Rails Engine was a project where we got to flex our ActiveRecord muscles and rebuild a project from mod 1 using ActiveRecord. We worked in pairs to accomplish this task, and I partnered with Brandon Stewart. 
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a good project to establish my confidence in Mod3. Going into a new module comes with a certain level of anxiety around how well a person can succeed in that environment. For me I was unsure whether or not I would be successful. I was happy to know that I was able to contribute equally to the project that Brandon and I worked on. Furthermore, if I'm being completely honest, I have looked up to Brandon as a great programmer since Mod1. To have him validate my work, and praise my contributions was especially nice. 

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description> The Pivot was a brownfield project where Mod 3 students took a code base from Mod 2's Little Shop project and then implemented a set of new features. One caveat was that the groups did not get to work on their code base from Mod2, but rather they would adopt a new code base and work within the confines of that codebase. 
>* \<Takeaways, your experience> My biggest takeaway from this project is how important a good team that communicates well is. This was a really challenging experience because we had to preserve the features that existed prior to receiving the code base. While this was a challenge, if I did not have a group that was so great at working together it would have been a much bigger challenge. I am really grateful that I had the team that I did.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\My biggest takeway from the Gearups this module is that soemtimes the best solution to a problem is the dissolution of that problem. Back when we had the MicroAgressions gearup that my Module had, there were so many things that I wanted to say to both sides. However I myself realized that since the discussion had abandoned any semblence of rational disourse, my contributions would only add gas to this fire. The best thign that I could do was to remove myself from that situation, for my own emotional well-being. I have begun to extrapolate this lesson to other areas of my life, and it has helped me maintain a rational state-of-mind in heated moments. 

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \ I was SAB Rep for 1706BE. 

#### **Posse**
  >* \ We took the time to destress and reflect over the week. 
  >* \One cool thing that we did during our Possee was to have one of our mentors come in and talk to us about how the industry has evolved over the course of the past few decades. This was especially cool to hear because it was a theory heavy conversation. 
  >* \When I was researching how to port my app to a mobile platform, I posted in my posse channel about different options i could take. I ended up receiving alot of good advice from different mentors. 

#### **Playing a Part**

> \I've been part of the Queer Qoders group here at turing.
