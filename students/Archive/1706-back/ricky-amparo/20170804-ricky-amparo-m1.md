# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

    My priority, going into Mod 1, was to gain a better understanding of the coding language I was being taught.
  I wanted to understand the fundamentals that make a great software developer. To that end, I put most of my energy into working on the projects, studying for assessments and gathering as much as I can from classes. I feel as if I was successful in my goal because I now feel as if I can call myself a junior developer. While it has only been 5 weeks since I started this experience, I have been able to learn much more than I thought was possible.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The area that I struggled the most with this Mod has been reaching out to the Turing community. There are so many wonderful activities and clubs happening at Turing. Yet, I didn't participate in any extracurricular because I thought it would be detrimental and distracting to my goal of learning the fundamentals. Additionally, it typically takes me some time to become comfortable with a new  environment and start opening up to those around me. For Mod 2, I want to shift my mindset around the community because I don't want to miss out on finding something that I could really enjoy.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was definitely Battleship, for two reasons. The first because it was a project that I had in my AP Computer Science class, 10 years ago and so it was a great callback. The second because it was a clearly defined project that you could interact with. It was nice to be able to show this project, as an example of my growth, to my friends and family. A sort of tangible indication that I was learning.

  My least favorite project was the Sorting Suite, primarily because it was hard to focus on it with the thought of Black Thursday coming soon. I found myself reading through the Black Thursday Specs while I was working on Sorting Suite.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned that I need to start them as soon as possible. By the end of this Mod I found myself having much more initiative when it came to these projects. It's as if I learned, from experience, that I would get eventually get stuck and need as much time as possible. I also found that I performed better when I didn't feel the pressure of having to finish by the next day.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I need to be patient for the first few days of a pairing. I found that the most turbulent times with teammates was during the beginning of our projects. After reflecting on this trend I realized something that I should have been thinking about from the very start: any new pairing needs an adjustment period. No one can expect two different people, with different learning and working styles, to be able to sync up in a day or two. Moving forward I will remind myself of this lesson any time that I doubt a new partnership.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was debugging the gender gap primarily because it provided me with the social context of the software developer world. While I understand that this context was displayed through the lens of gender disparages, it's lesson can be applied to other social lens such as race and sexual orientation. It was refreshing to be able to have these kinds of conversations and I would like to continue engaging in them.

My least favorite Gear Up would have to be the Gear Up lead by the Mod 4 students. I appreciate the effort that they put into organizing these Gear Ups as well as the subject matter that they wanted to address. I did feel that it could have been handled with clearer direction. There were moments where the same group of people were talking and I wanted to hear from others who hadn't spoke. Additionally, the turn and talks combined with the multi-questioned prompts made the moments where we did have to speak confusing. That being said I did appreciate their honesty and candor. The facilitators did state that this session was not necessarily a session to "cheer lead" for Turing, but to rather objectively examine the culture of Coding Schools.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

The most I contributed to the Turing community was to deliver my lightning talk about something important to me and to be as vulnerable as I was. I stated earlier that I did not engage as much as I wanted to with the Turing Community, that I had blinds on to be able to focus on learning to code. Moving forward, I want to start peeling those blinds back and contributing from this community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

There were plenty of ways that I have thought about engaging with the community. One idea I had was to start a philosophy lightning talk group, or even just a meeting. Another would be to simply joins pre-existing groups and contribute that way. I certainly don't want to limit myself in what I can and cannot do at Turing.
