## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I struggled to some degree on every project, but I learned a lot in the process.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erose357/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

Learn what it is, then create a linked list that makes cool noises

Notes:
9 tests, all passing
Working through end of iter 2 + prepend
Methods are fairly clean, talked about how to refactor & extract

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
5. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/erose357/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Recreate the board game Battleship in Ruby using a simple REPL interface

Notes: Runs from battleship file, can enter coordinates, quit also works
Used multiple classes that make sense and interact logically.
Some improvement on naming possible
26 9 tests passing For the most part saw a lot of methods that were smaller and had a more isolated task
Some pretty long methods still exist

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
4. Git Workflow

PASS: Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.
4. REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
6. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In the past, I've had bad experiences with group projects.  I enjoyed both of the group projects
this module.  I had great partners and I learned from both of them.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DesTodo/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Create a program that translates English to Braille and back again

Translates from English to Braille and back
Lines are truncated to 80 for up to 160 characters
Multiple test files, converter test is broken down into incremental tests
Multiple errors when running the test files Code is broken into classes Methods and variables are named so as to tell a story One super long method in Converter, but were able to speak to how they wanted to refactor this


1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).
4. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.  


#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtruong2/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Learn how to work with large data structures and more complicated class relationships

Notes:
Through Iter 3
Testing:
109 tests & assertions
80% coverage
Used based data, some fixtures for more isolated functionality i.e. merchant
Testing off MerchantRepo for the Merchant test
Ruby Style:
Variable names do not illustrate what they are holding (i.e. a, x)
Talked about how to break long method chains into methods on related classes
find, find_all, map, each
Convert row to hash, then hash to Merchant info
Many methods that use multiple enumerables
Reaching through multiple classes to run methods

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
2. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
4. Functional Expectations

2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3
5. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

"Not yet."  This is my new motivational phrase.  My experience at Turing, so far, has been incredibly frustrating, but rewarding.  I frequently remind myself of the "yet" mentality and the idea that I just need to keep working at it.

#### Video: "How To Get Better At Learning Hard Things"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I am more aware of my cognitive resources.  I've known for a while now that I can only effectively do one thing at a time and now I know why.  I also know why I like to eat mountains of ice cream on the weekend - my wife still doesn't approve.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I believe this lesson was a reflection on how to maintain a growth mindset and understanding different personality types.  For growth mindset: "not yet", compartmentalize, and celebrate the small victories.  Regardless of personality type, it's important to have an open mind and discuss with your group partner/partners how you can best work together.


#### Turing Citizenship #3: Public Narrative

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)

I don't like talking about myself, but I understand why it's important because of this gear up and other similar sessions.  This is an opportunity to challenge my self consciousness and build confidence.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I want to be part of the solution, not the problem.  I have to police myself first and make sure I'm not subtly contributing to the negativities highlighted in the video because that is the culture I grew up in.

#### Gear Up with M4 Students: Lending Priviledge

* [GitHub URL]()

Because it was in the same day this gear up became an extension of the Debugging the Gender Gap gear up.  I was not familiar with the term Lending priviledge before this gear up, but it's a concept I'm familiar with and something I've tried to work on as an adult.  In my previous career I did my best to support one of my coworkers who was being treated differently because she is a woman.  It was difficult and I'm glad I did it, but in the future I want to be able to do more.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I don't feel like a did very much to support the community.  I did clean up the kitchen once and make coffee a few times.
