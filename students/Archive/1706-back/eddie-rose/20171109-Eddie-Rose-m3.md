## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to become more comfortable working with APIs, both consuming and providing, and to improve my understanding of SQL and ActiveRecord.

>I'd like to build a Rails back-end API providing data to a JS front-end.  I'm looking forward to learning JS.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/erose357/apicurious)
>* In this project, weâ€™ll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.
>* Learning Oauth was cool, this project helped me understand POROs and services

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/erose357/project_manager)**
>* I wanted to create a collaborative construction project management app
>* I learned I had no idea of the scale of this at the beginning.  I want to keep working on this over time.  I need to spend more time on front-end, I lost a lot of time in styling

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/blsrofe/rails_engine)**
>* In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
>* I really liked getting more practice with ActiveRecord and SQL in this project, I want to spend more time on both.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown](Microaggression)
This gear-up made me more sensitive to other people's experiences and how it can influence their perspective.  Also to be more careful in my speech, some terms and phrases considered to be normal can be offensive.

> [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown](Tragedy of the Commons)  
I was out sick this day

> [](Cold Outreach - led by Mod 4)
This was a great gear-up.  Cold Outreach gives me anxiety and this provided me with ways to make cold outreach more comfortable
## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**


#### **Posse**
  >* Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module
  >* We paired up with other posses to practice sharing our personal stories
  >* How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?
  >* I really struggle with the new posse structure, but it has helped me meet students from the other mods.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I paired/helped lower mod students from time to time
