# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?  
I'm really looking forward to learning JavaScript and gaining a better understanding of the front-end

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/**fail**) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

```
## Rubric

- Did not do story 3
- Would move `getRequests.topColor()` in `document.ready`
- `appendSwatches` is pretty long and doing more than just appending, I would break that down into smaller functions
- Code is easy to read and understand and the beginning of organization is there but need to continue

### 1. Completion:
  * At a minimum, developer completes challenges 1-3 and deploys to GitHub pages in the allotted three hours.

Below Expectations

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

Meets Expectations

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

Meets Expectations

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

Meets Expectations  
```

* What was your biggest technical challenge?  

   time - when I'm writing the code I like to think through why I'm doing it, so I've struggled with the timed assessments my entire time at Turing 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?  

  I like being given a problem and building a solution.  It's gratifying when you make it do the thing.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  

  I started at the first step and came up with a rough idea of what it would take to accomplish it.  Then I started with the simplest problem I could solve first and as I solved each problem I moved on to the next.
* What did you learn?  

   1. Try to work faster  
   2. I lost some time at the end trying to format colors so they could be posted back to the the API before I realized I already had an array I just needed to change the return of one of my functions.   

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (**pass**/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
```
## Rubric

This assessment is intended to ensure that each student has the fundamental knowledge to graduate from Turing and give each student a sense of what a technical interview may entail.

The bar for "meeting expectations" for this assessment is as follows:

### 1. Professionalism

Student arrived early / on time. Student came adequately-prepared (i.e., with a writing utensil) and looks presentable.

*  Above Expectations

### 2. Communication

The student engages in a reasonable amount of eye contact and nonverbal communication. The student can clearly articulate their response to the question and shares their thought process in a logical, well-organized manner. If the student is unclear about something, they ask for clarity or feedback from their interviewer.

*  Meets Expectations

### 3. Technical Accuracy

The student answers the questions with accuracy. If the student does not know the answer or is making an educated guess, they communicate this to the interviewer.

*  Above Expectations

### 4. Technical Detail

Student is specific and detailed when responding to questions. The student gives approproate examples to support their responses. When students contribute their opinion (both positive and negative), they demonstrate they can think critically and understand different perspectives on a topic.

*  Above Expectations
```
* What was your biggest challenge?  

   I get really nervous during interview situations
* What did you like the most about the challenge?  

  I really appreciate the practice, I don't think there's any other way to prepare because of the nerves factor
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  

   I always have to try to relax as much as possible.  When I'm nervous I can't think straight and I have trouble processing the questions.  It's hard to recreate that nervous tension, so this was a good opportunity to practice working on those emotions.  
* What did you learn?  

   I did better than I thought I would.  I'm also going to continue studying based on the questions asked in the assessment.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?  

   getting a better understanding of DOM manipulation and getting the jQuery listeners to fire when I wanted them to  

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  

   trial and error, and inspecting the elements on the page  

* What did you like the most about the challenge?  

   the front-end stuff is more gratifying because it's less boring to my wife when I show her something I'm  excited about accomplishing  

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?  

   DOM Manipulation, first insight into how async works in JS

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?  

   I would worked to understand JS promises better I also would have exported and imported functions differently.  As the project got larger it became difficult to jump around to different files.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?  

   I had a great partner and we worked well together.  Both of us prefer to work alone most of the time, but when we started working on a new piece that was just introduced in class or either one of us was stuck on something we would work together to figure it out.  

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?  

 Â  time - learning a new language and implementing it and the new framework with a new ORM really pushed me to timebox and create a balance between studying and implementation

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  

  1. In the beginning I worked on basic Python syntax, I was worried this cost me too much time, but I think overall it was beneficial because everything I saw after that point I could at least recognize without to much extra effort.  
  2. Simulaneously, I read as much as I could comparing what seemed to be the two most commonly used web frameworks for Python and I decided to use Flask.  I did the same for the ORM and settled on SQLAlchemy.  
  
  3. Then I worked through a few tutorials and got base functionality up and running and started building the app from there.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?  

   I realized that syntax isn't as big of a hurdle as I anticipated and I was able to translate concepts I learned in Ruby and Rails over to Python and Flask

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?  

  I'm not sure how to answer this, my goal with this project was apply concepts to a new programming language and environment and improve my understanding, here are some things I'd like to improve in the project
  
  1.  refactor and DRY up the code especially in my routes  
  
  2.  work on a better understanding of Python modules and break out the models into separate files
  
  3.  finished creating table relationships in the ORM and write more complex queries

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?  

   openfoodnetwork.org

* What was your biggest technical challenge?  

  wrapping my head around a single codebase that was larger than all my projects put together 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  

   I looked around at the directory structure of the app then I decided to try and target the problem from the issue and narrow my focus on anything related to that

* What did you like the most about the challenge?  

   It was intimidating and I'm glad I challenged that and it built my confidence a litte even though the problem we solved was simple.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?  

   1. sometimes abstraction gets overwhelming, but it's still easier than working with gigantic files  
   2. writing a good PR  
   3. I want to contribute more to open source in the future  

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?  
   
   Be confident that you are competent.  I know I've learned a lot here at Turing and I'm going to work to continue developing these skills.  

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?  

   I did not enjoy the experience of planning the gear-up, it felt very distracting.  It was valuable though, I learned more about open source, some of the ethical dilemmas around it and more about licensing.  It made me really happy that the students who attended felt it was valuable because that was my biggest concern.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?  
   I tried to help lower mod students and work with others in the cohort on problems they were having.  Going forward I would like to continue helping newer programmers and working through problems together.  

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?  
 Â  1. breaking larger problems into smaller pieces  
   2. reading docs and improving my understanding of the technologies I'm familiar with and learning new technologies more quickly  
   3. improving my ability to write code that's maintainable
