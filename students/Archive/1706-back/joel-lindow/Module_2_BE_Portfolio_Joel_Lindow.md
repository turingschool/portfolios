## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had many individual projects in Module 2. Although many of them were not graded they still provided great vehicles for learning. Here are a few I completed:

#### Robot World

* [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/robot-world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/robot-world)

A CRUD intro using Active Record. NO RAILS. This program introduced me to C.R.U.D. as well as a lot of styling concepts. Also an introduction to MVC.

There was no eval and there were no scores for this project.

#### Comic Book Collection

* [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/comic_book_collection)
* [Heroku Link](https://stormy-falls-74498.herokuapp.com/)

A Rails project using Schema Designer. We also used one-to-many relationships and many-to-many relationships. This project allows a user to add books, create books, build a collection and much more. Allows an Admin user to be able to delete books that are inappropriate as well as use a dashboard to view information about the site as a whole.

There was no eval and there were no scores for this project.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We did 2 large graded projects in module 2. Both of them were great learning experiences.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/JoelLindow/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

This project required us to import large CSV files to seed our database. We created an app that allowed for the management of statistics involving:
* Bike stations
* Bike trips
* Weather

Also, it provided a dashboard where statistics for all provided data could be viewed in a condensed format.

##### Eval scores
1. Functional Expectations
* 3
2. ActiveRecord
* 4
3. User Experience and Conventions
* 3
4. Code Organization/Quality
* 4
5. Testing
* 4
6. Working Collaboratively
* 4

All feedback was overwhelmingly positive. I was told that deliberate practice in a few areas would help and that I was on the right track. I was told I offered good communication and teamwork as well as contributed to a lot of issues throughout the project. I was also complimented on my CSS styling, as it was all new to us at this point.


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/katiekeel/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Building a Shop. Basically E-Commerce. This should use the following features:
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Carts
* Orders as well as past order history
* Sessions
* Encrypted Passwords

## D: Professional Skills
We did a lot of personal development this module. I took each lesson to heart and encouraged others to do the same.

### Gear Up
#### Being an Ally

I enjoyed this session. Although I think that a lot of the articles portrayed ugly stereotypes of white males, I still tried to look at it from a perspective of someone else who might have had bad interactions. I do feel the session was somewhat unfairly targeted at one people-group, while telling us to not target ANY people group at the same time so it was a bit of a contradiction in ways. However, it conveyed the importance of safe places for people of all demographics to fail, converse and grow together to better interact with society as a whole. It was a positive session, despite a few ugly things.

#### Feedback II Reflection

A great chance to do group feedback on a big project. We got to discuss the struggles and wins we had as a team. We also got to offer each other feedback on how to grow in some areas and stay on track with others.


#### Feedback III

I paired with a front end student named Laura. We got to talk about how we receive feedback and how we can learn to use feedback better. We talked about being aware of our triggers and how to be aware of things that might trigger others. It was a great session of discovery.

#### Using your Strengths as a Team Member

A session where we were able to talk about out group project one more time. A chance to recognize our own strengths and each others strengths using the Strengths Finder assessment. My whole group enjoyed this conversation and were able to recognize shared strengths a few of us had.
