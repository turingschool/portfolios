# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * Firm up concepts I was struggling with in Rails.
  * I feel I did. I'm still wishing I was stronger in 1 or 2 things, but I'm really excited about what I've been able to lock in.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * I struggled with Plugging in code for Authentication and Authorization
  * I learned how it works. I feel really confident in the logic and I can debug other peoples code pretty well but personally still struggle with it as far as the code goes.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  * The Ruby Mini Project was my favorite. It was a fun change to try building something out from the ground up.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  * I learned how to crud things out pretty well and explore deeper concepts on my own or figure out who I needed to ask for help and the best ways to ask.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  * Great work tools like Waffle
  * Good Agile practices
  * How to exploit each individuals tasks.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  * My favorite was the Gear Up on Group-Think. Because it gave people a chance to voice their concern about some of the group think that takes place and is forced on other right here at Turing. It was a very positive session
  * I didn't have a least favorite. They were all equally valuable.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  * Helping Mod 1 Students with project contents
  * Running a spike session for Mod 1 to learn about basic test driven development and building classes
  * Joined a 15 minute Q&A session with Jeff and LinkedIn about Student Life
  * Evangelized the group-building power of WrapUp sessions

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  * Continue to help lower mod students visualize concepts they might be struggling with
