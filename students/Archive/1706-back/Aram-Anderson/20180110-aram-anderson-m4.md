# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

Mostly JavaScript and applying for jobs. I feel like that went okay. I learned some JS and got a job.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Cleaning the input data. It was gross.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Getting through it once it was done.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I used a gross regex.

* What did you learn?

I learned a bunch about regexes.


## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass.

* What was your biggest challenge?

Describing the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked the debugging challenge.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I just kept talking till I got there.

* What did you learn?

Probably don't just keep talking. I feel like it would have been better if I just said what I do and don't know.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Backend JS. I feel like it was hard to translate many of the concepts I learned in Ruby/Rails into JS and Express.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Just work. I kept at it till I understood it.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I like front end JS. I'm not crazy about the BE.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Promises, DOM traversal, and JS abstraction.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I would try to understand the backend a little better than I did.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was good. We mostly worked independently and split the project into two.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

I did it in Elixir/Phoenix, and I had never done any functional programming before.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I took a couple days out of the project work time and did a Udemy course to learn how it worked.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I learned a ton. I feel like I'd really enjoy continuing to learn functional programming.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Data immutability was hard and interesting, not instantiating objects to hold on to state, and using plugs.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

Open Food Network.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Finding the file in the codebase.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Doing global finds with terms in the dev tools in Chrome till we found something.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was pretty satisfying to see the PR get approved.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

HAML, Spree, and that too much CSS abstraction is not always a good thing.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

To give myself more credit and be less self deprecating about my abilities. I'm trying to do that, and I'll keep trying to be conscious of being more positive about myself.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I did enjoy it, but I feel like there was totally inadequate planning time and resources given to us to accomplish it in a good way. We aren't teachers, and an hour to plan this was just far too little. We could have done more planning outside the allotted time, but we also had a million other things to do that were actually requirements to graduate, so the gear up planning never felt like that high a priority. I feel like a couple more hours of scheduled time to plan would be really helpful, as well as maybe a lesson on how to plan for non teachers.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I did pairing quite a few times with lower mod students.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Technically, I feel like there are a ton. Understanding programming, for starters. I'm going to a Rails shop, so Rails will certainly be a tech skill I'll use.
Knowing how to find an answer for a technical question is something I've learned.
How to network and connect with people in my industry is a big one as well.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md): I already have a job, so I'll be taking 2 weeks off, then going to work. That's about it. 
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
