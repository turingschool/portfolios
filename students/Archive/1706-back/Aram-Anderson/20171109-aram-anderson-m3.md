# Aram Anderson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  To gain confidence and skills in more complex uses of Rails. I feel like learning APIs was the main thing I really wanted to get out of this mod (both production and consumption). I feel like that was successful, and I learned a lot about APIs. I feel confident in their use.
  I also learned a lot more about ActiveRecord and SQL than I knew before, which was really helpful. Doing the queries in Rales Engine was a great learning experience.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |

| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

  I learned a lot about myself as a programmer in this mod as well. I think many of the projects zeroed in on my weak points, and this mod gave me an opportunity to evaluate how I can improve on those weak points. Organization and process were the biggest areas for improvement that I faced, and I feel like I really was able to improve that process.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/Aram-Anderson/api_curious) (Optional)**

An app that consumes the GitHub API to reproduce the main profile page of GitHub.

This project led me down quite a few rabbit holes. The functionality remained simple, but I really tried to refactor the code I had into the smallest pieces possible, and make them as flexible as possible. I learned a lot from that project with regard to consuming external APIs.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/Aram-Anderson/job_hunt)**

An app that helps users to track the job search process. It pulls in data from the Glassdoor API to give the user an analysis of the company they are looking at, and the Watson API to give the user an analysis of the job description. The Watson analysis gives the user keywords that are in the job description, allowing them to scaffold a cover letter addressing the main points.

I feel like I learned a lot about where my own weaknesses lie, and what I can do to address those. The first project I started out with was an ambiguous and conceptual idea, and didn't have a lot of concrete ideas that were actionable. I feel like that's a tendency I have. When I was building custom furniture, I would do the same thing, but it was a little easier to work out in that context. Once I made a pivot to the project I completed, I went in the complete opposite direction, and built out the entire project in Waffle and kept to strict TDD. I feel like that was a great lesson for me, and resulted in the project being much more manageable, and far less stressful to complete.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/Aram-Anderson/rails_engine)**

A Rails API backend that serves JSON responses based on ActiveRecord queries of sales data loaded from CSVs.

This was my favorite project. I found the idea of using Rails as a backend API only was really interesting. I'd like to learn a lot more about front end so I can implement Rails as a standalone backend and build a separate front end app. I also really enjoyed building the queries, as that was a return to some of the logic work that was such a strong part of mod 1.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/Aram-Anderson/the_pivot_redux)**

The aim of this project was to take a brownfield app written by someone else, which did single tenancy e-commerce and turn it into a multi-tenant e-commerce platform.
This was, by far, the hardest project I've done while attending Turing, but also one of the most valuable. I'm not proud of the outcome, but I am proud of the lessons I learned through the process. Learning how to do handrolled authorization for multiple permission levels for different users was sometimes frustrating, but a great learning experience. We ended up building out a PORO that handled all the permissions, which was a little ugly, but worked well. The biggest challenge we faced was keeping a green test suite on the existing functionality as we made the necessary changes. Because we were adding new relationships where existing models were now dependent on new models, our changes caused problems throughout the test suite. Additionally, we inherited a code base with a test data creation strategy that was highly inflexible. The group that built the original project had essentially created a very complex version of factory_girl in a helper file in the spec directory. Eventually, we decided the upfront cost of going in and rewriting the tests to use factories would be worth it, and we did that.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I feel like my role in this gear up was mainly to listen as it was addressing a topic that I, given my demographic, tend not to experience. I felt like it was a good gear up, but I had to leave a little early. Apparently, I missed some of the more intense discussion on the topic, but I did enjoy what I was there for.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I paired with several mod 2 students on learning rails/sinatra, as well as a little bit of pairing with mod 1 students on vanilla ruby. I would have liked to do more, as that's really helpful for me to remember ruby concepts I haven't explicitly used in a while.

#### **Posse**
  The posse I'm in was pretty scattered this mod. Usually when I would go to the meeting time and place, there would be nobody there. I feel like I would enjoy a more structured posse experience based around a common interest or project more than the random assignment we have now.
  The general theme of my posse has always just been a place to sit and talk about the Turing experience and how things are going. That's been good, but like I said above, I'd really prefer a posse based around learning something outside the Turing curriculum.
  We've had a couple of chances to talk to mentors about employment, which was helpful.

#### **Playing a Part**

  Outside of pairing, I feel like I was able to help some of my cohort mates, as well as ask for help from those people.
