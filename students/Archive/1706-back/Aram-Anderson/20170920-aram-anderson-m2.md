# Aram Anderson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

In looking back at my mod 1 portfolio, I wanted to help people with developing a personal site. That didn't really happen, and I think that just didn't stay as a priority for me, or for many of my classmates. I feel like just staying on top of the workload ate up more time than I thought it would.

It's really general, but I think I set out this mod to understand how ruby relates to web apps, and how using ruby in rails is helpful. This larger idea is still something I'd like to explore in much more depth, but I think that will take time. I know that rails is mainly using ruby to accomplish what it's doing, but it's such a complex set of interactions that I feel like it will just take time to get a handle on what's happening under the hood in rails.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with the memorization. In looking at the above answer, I think the real world result is that there is a lot of magic I don't understand in rails. That means I don't understand the logic, and using rails at this point is mainly just memorizing how to interact with it. I don't yet feel like I understand rails well enough to work through patterns of logic, but I think with time I'll get there.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I liked little shop the most. I think it was interesting getting into the sessions stuff and implementing the cart. I think I just liked little shop the most because I feel like it was the project I learned the most from.

I didn't like blogger much. It just felt like I was parroting a tutorial without understanding what I was doing at all. I know that's part of the process, and especially in rails that knowledge comes through repetition. But even so, the process felt tedious.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that styling is hard. I feel like that's something I'd really like to get better at.

I also learned that rails is chock full of rabbit holes to go down, and it takes effort to avoid them. I found myself wasting hours trying to figure out how to implement something, even if it wasn't necessary, just because I knew it could be done. I guess the main takeaway there is just learning to stay on track.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

There is a great deal of value in having a well thought out workflow and using the tools that help implement that. We were mostly good about sticking to that workflow, and it was clear when we went off track. The only merge conflicts that we ran into could be traced directly to straying from our workflow.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was the Mod 4 led gear up on transhumanism. I think I just really like that one because it spawned a lot of interesting conversation. I think one of the more interesting sides of tech (and least talked about) are ethics. I think a topic like transhumanism makes those conversations unavoidable, and I think that's a good thing.

My least favorite was the session on agile. I just feel like I didn't get much out of it, and I'm not sure what I was supposed to get from it. I feel like agile is a good idea, but it strikes me as strange to think of it as something with any more importance than a workflow. It's pretty weak as a philosophy, is totally focused on programming as a commodity, and lacks an ethical agenda of any kind. That's obviously just my opinion, but I just see it as a guideline for a workflow.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Not as much as I should have. I did a good amount of pairing with mod 1 students, and I paired with people in my own mod.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I've been looking into putting together a hackathon. I still feel like that's something I'd like to do, though it will take a lot more work to make it happen. I'd really like to see something that targeted needs in the nonprofit community, and made some connections for both the nonprofit sector and the coding sector. I feel like that's a huge need in the nonprofit world, and open source could be a good avenue to make that connection.
