## Areas of Emphasis

I feel like the I set out to learn quite a few things. In bullet points, I think it was something like this:

1. Learn about pure ruby fundamentals.
   * Syntax and style
   * Structure
   * Data manipulation
   * Conventions
2. Learn about programming in the bigger sense
   * Algorithms
   * Program architecture
   * Logical deconstruction of problems(for lack of a better term)
3. Learn about the programming industry

I think those were the big areas I had in mind coming in. I didn't really know what to expect in a lot of ways, because my familiarity with the subject matter was pretty shallow to start with.

My struggles this mod were mostly around rethinking the way I approach a problem. TDD has definitely been a difficult area for me, but I've come around. TDD offers some huge advantages.
Outside of school, it's been a struggle trying to create a reasonable balance between the demands of the program and the demands of my outside life. I'm still working on that, and really hoping that in the reset between mods I'll be able to create some specific ways to do better.

## Projects

My favorite project this mod was Complete Me. I found the data structure really interesting, and it was cool to learn more about using hashes on that one. I really enjoyed learning about recursion, and I feel like complete me gave me a much deeper understanding of how it works.

I think my least favorite was Black Thursday. I really liked the project itself, but it was very frustrating dealing with csv files that didn't actually correspond with each other. It just meant that there was one "right" path to take through the orm, even though logically a different way would have worked if the files had lined up.

In my independent projects, I learned that I need to be more organized. I feel like my approach tends to naturally veer toward scattershot. I kind of like that, but I feel like it's most certainly detrimental to my progress. I learned that having a clear path and micro-goals is extremely helpful for me, and I'm making strides to incorporate that strategy in my work.

In the paired projects I learned that I really like pairing. I was fortunate in that both of my paired projects set me up with partners I work really well with. I came into the program fairly worried about the paired portion of the work (group projects in college weren't my favorite) but in the end I feel like I got a lot more out of both projects because they were paired.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I really liked the gender gap gear up. I think it highlighted some very important issues which many in the tech community don't put much thought into. It was also moving to see how these issues manifest in the real world, and impact real people's lives.

I think my least favorite was the strengths and storytelling gear up. I find the idea of "personal branding" pretty gross. I'm a human being, not a product. It's very likely just a semantic hang up on my part that's behind that feeling, and I can own that. I also know the core of the gear up is something I need to do, and I probably just need to get over myself.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I did sessions going through a small project with some other people from the mod during lunch a few times. That started out with another person just asking me about one of the independent assessments we took. A few people ended up being interested in what that looked like, so we just did kind of a live code thing and went through it.
I hope that was helpful for others, but it was actually very helpful for me. It really cements things for me when I have to explain them, and I'd like to try to do that more often.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I've offered to help people get personal sites up using jekyll. I'd like to do that. Much like the previous section, I feel like it would help me to help someone else go through that process.
