# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

- What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to have a good understanding of Rails basics at the end of the module.
I think that I was successful in this. I feel confident that I can build a basic
Rails app quickly and properly. I enjoyed diving into the things that we learned and
supplementing it with outside resources.

- What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think that the biggest struggle for me this mod was adapting to the larger groups. I learned
that the best way for me to work is to be assigned things to do, and go do them. I noticed that
my experiences working in a group differed vastly between groups. In the first group that
I was in I was struggling with a feeling of not working efficiently enough, and I had
to learn to let it go a bit and work with the group.

## Projects

- What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was Little Shop because it was a smart way for us as students
to apply what we have learned. I thought it was cool implementing things such as
authentication, authorization, and carts. My least favorite project was Bike Share,
because it was written in Sinatra. I was excited to dive into Rails by that project
but we had to do that large project before we got hands on with Rails.

- What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that I can confidently build a basic Rails app with CRUD functionality.
I took my own lesson from last mod and was able to more efficiently attack these
independent projects.

- What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I need to figure out my best way of working in a large group. I enjoyed
Little Shop, but still was trying to figure out how to work as efficiently as possible,
which is not in everyone's interest because we are learning.

## Community

- What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was the Johari Window one. I enjoyed that gear up because
it was interesting to see what people thought about me in our group work experiences.
My least favorite was Groupthink. I had trouble reading the article because of the
author's writing style and mistakes. It also felt like the lesson was not fully
fleshed out.

- How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I made myself available to people both in the cohort and in the cohort below me for help.
Brandon and I put together a git workshop that we presented to our posse and a few people
from outside of the posse.

- What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to take part in some of the events. Possibly get onto a panel, participate
in the code fair, and demo something at demo night.
