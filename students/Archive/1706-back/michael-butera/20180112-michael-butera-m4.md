# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to focus on learning a new technology and trying to expand my breadth of knowledge.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Using fetch.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I enjoyed getting to show that I had an understanding of a technology that was brand new to me.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I read documentation and incrementally worked on building up my fetch function.

* What did you learn?

I learned that I can do something in a new language and know how to apply techniques that I learned in Ruby to other languages.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

Getting into the technical nitty gritty about langauges.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked that I got to practice talking about technology and prove that I know what I am doing. I enjoyed the bug fix portion.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I don't really understand this question. I talked about Ruby as much as I could.

* What did you learn?

I learned that I need to study up on how to talk about Ruby and OOP at a lower level.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Working with a new technology. I had issues with organization because I started writing code before our lesson on directory structure.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I started to refactor the code that I had wrote.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Learning from making mistakes.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

JavaScript, DOM manipulation with jQuery, API calls with JS

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

Waiting to write code until we learned how to structure our directories.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was fine. We did a good job of splitting out the work and then pairing on things that were giving us issues.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Getting Spark and Hadoop to work on a single macbook.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I had to dive deep into configuration options but was unable to get it working. I had to pivot and use LightFM to do the machine learning portion of my project.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

The ability to work on something that was not taught here.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Spark, Hadoop, Python


## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

Pokemon Showdown.

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Getting my Node.js updated to a current version.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I googled for instructions on how to update Node.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked contributing to an existing codebase. It felt good to know that I can do that now.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Contributing, JS testing, layout of a JS application.


## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

To work on my communication a bit. I made sure that I stayed up to date with Lauren during my capstone when I needed to reduce scope or pivot.


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I did not enjoy leading a Gear Up. There is a lot going on during Mod 4, and spending time doing something like that felt like time that could be better spent doing work on projects, cover letters, and applications. There was not a lot of time set aside to do it which made me understand why the ones that I attended prior to being in Mod 4 did not feel like they were done whole-heartedly. The actual session was fun though. I usually don't like to speak in front of people and I think that getting that chance to practice was good, and I think I did well.


## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I was supportive of my cohort-mates when they had issues that they needed help with. I think it is important because it teaches us skills like empathy.


## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Building APIs, pairing, and testing


## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://gist.github.com/ButeraMV/735f60f0c63a5d2b922fabf7bb8e50b5):
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.

Ever since I was a kid I have been interested in technology. I've been a PC gamer since you could install games with floppy disks. After my childhood I followed many paths and wound up spending some time in the Navy. After that I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and have worked many different jobs. My most recent job was locksmithing, which was fun because it was problem solving. I was teaching myself programming while I was there and decided that I wanted to be able to spend a whole work day coding, so I applied to Turing. Now that I completed my learning there I am ready to use and sharpen my skills working for a company.

* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
