# Michael Butera - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I set out to get a better handling of Rails and database management.
I was able to sink a lot of time into working with external APIs which was fun and
something that I have been wanting to do since I have been seeing a lot of jobs
that ask for experience in working with APIs.

>* I enjoyed how we got to split into different areas of interest this module.
I felt that I was able to contribute to work often and meaningfully this module.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* This project was to introduce us to consuming an external API. I consumed GitHub's
API and built a dashboard display with user information after logging in through
GitHub OAuth. I learned a lot about using documentation and Postman to form API calls.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I set out to build a crowdfunded book publishing service. I found that the project
was bigger than I thought that it would be. I learned how to manage issues that came
up and design that was needed but I hadn't originally thought about. I got to work
with the Stripe API which was something that I have been wanting to dive into.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Rales Engine was the project that introduced us to building out an API. This
project was a great pairing experience for me since Aram and I have similar grasps
on the concepts and work similarly. I learned a lot about keeping an API RESTful
in this project since there were so many routes that we needed to hit.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* The Pivot was a painful but great project. I learned a lot about managing
issues that come with inheriting an existing codebase. Working in a group on a
project that had so many requirements was a good experience due to my team
composition. We all understood each others working preferences and were able to
split work and pair in an amount that I felt was most efficient. We were able to
get the project to a point that we were pretty happy with, and I feel that we
did pretty well.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I helped Brandon lead a Git spike during posse time and paired with a few Module
2 students.

#### **Posse**
>* The best use of posse time was probably the session that we had the Git spike.
I feel that to maximize posse time next module we will need to discuss what we can
do over the break. Meeting a few new people and then trying to talk about what we
are doing after a session or two doesn't seem to be effective.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I try to make myself available to people in and outside of my cohort for help
with code and for moral support.
