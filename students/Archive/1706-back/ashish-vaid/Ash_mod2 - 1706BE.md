## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

The focus of mod 2 was to introduce us to the Rails framework and developing and deploying web applications. I was excited that this module would allow us to create simple, yet functional projects with a real world application to them. Throughout this experience, I've come to better understand the underlying logic and complexity it takes for an application to be effective, especially as I browse other sites for either classwork/homework, or personal leisure. Additionally, as a repeat student for this module I wanted to make sure I focused on the main topics which weren’t as clear to me as the first time I went through this module. This included join tables/many to many relationships and Active Record.


## Areas of Growth

(What did you struggle with most this module?)

Styling was difficult for me when we first received the pre-work for mod 2. I had watched a few tutorials related to this prior to coming to Turing so I knew the very basics, but I knew that styling and front end development wasn't a strong interest area for me; however, I know and understand the importance of having a functional knowledge in this area so that any project I may work will have at least some basic styling incorporated and not be visually too unappealing.


(What areas did you grow in most this module?)
After repeating, I now feel absolutely comfortable implementing full CRUD functions for a resource. There were a few lectures in particular where we went through that were extremely beneficial. These included some of the extra Active Record / SQL exercises we did compared to my previous experience.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/sidewinder2020/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment]( https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

(description)

(your goal and role in the project)

Goal was to better understand Active Record this time through and seeding data pulled from a CSV.



(reflection on project)
I felt we had a very good group dynamic and there were no issues with regards to personality conflicts. We were all committed to wanting to do well on this project and willing to come in to Turing campus over the weekend in order to work together. I really appreciated my fellow team members’ willingness to do this since they likely had family or commitments to their significant other during that time.



#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/vaidashi/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment]( http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(description)
A place to store your ideas.

(your goal for the project)
To effectively implement authorization and authentication.

(reflection on project)

I was satisfied in how I approached the project in that I was able to focus on CRUD practice and implementing authorization/authentication. However, that did make my efforts to style the site a last day endeavor and therefore it reflects that.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/vaidashi/uncle_franks_emporium)
* [Original Assignment]( http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(description)
Ecommerce application.

(your goal and role in the project)
To try and understand PORO’s better through the cart implementation.

(reflection on project)
Good team project. Unfortunately, my cart knowledge didn’t improve.

## C: Final Assessments

(how did you do on written and timed independent?)
(was this a representation of your best work?)

Yes, I did extremely well, especially compared to my previous attempt at this.
