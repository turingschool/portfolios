# Matt DeMarteau - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn how to build a web application in Rails and to become familiar with routing and Rails conventions. Also to learn how to test web applications.  Knowing there was a lot of information presented in Module 2, I wanted to focus on staying organized and working efficiently to complete all assignments on time.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed many individual tutorials and projects that proved to be very useful for building database-backed web applications in Sinatra and Rails.  There was a lot of information presented in Module 2 and it put great responsibility on the individual to keep up with all the work.  

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/robot_world)

__Project__ I created a Sinatra app from scratch. This app is a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. I programed the CRUD functionality for robots so that visitors can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot.

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

__Project__ I created an app to keep track of songs, artists, and playlists.  This tutorial reinforced my ability to create models with CRUD functionality and taught me skills necessary to create a functioning app in rails.

**Goals**
* deploy an app to Heroku
* write model tests using RSpec
* write feature tests using RSpec and Capybara
* use branches and commits to develop git workflow
* model one-to-many data relationships
* model many-to-many data relationships
* use factories to create objects to use in tests
* use partials and helpers to tidy up views
* model one-to-one data relationships
* use polymorphic associations to associate an object with one of several other models
* implement authentication using Twitter OAuth
* write controller and view specs

### Rails Mini Project - Gif Generator

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/gif_generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

__Project__ I created an app where users can "favorite" gifs. Admins can generate gifs by entering a one-word search term in field and then clicking "generate gif". Regular users are not able to create a new gif in the database. Gifs belong to a category (category is the original word that was searched for by the admin).  Categories can be created and destroyed by a logged-in admin user (regular logged in users cannot create or destroy categories)

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Through group projects, we explored best practices in agile project management and collaboration.  I had a great experience in both of my group projects and was proud of the projects we delivered.  I believe my experience pairing in Module 1 led to this success.  In both groups we had great communication and collaboration between team members.  We made sure to work more as a group instead of individually.  Both groups also agreed to bring up issues directly and frankly, but to stay mutually respectful by creating a safe environment for others to express themselves.

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

__Project__ In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.  RushHouh is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. It is important to note that we will not be creating this JavaScript. Instead we will simulate the process of gathering and receiving data, which we will call a payload. Our job was to build an application that can accept the submission of these payloads, analyze the data submitted, and display it through a HTML interface..

### Little Shop of Orders - No Refunds

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rdavid1099/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

__Project__ In this project we used Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.  Our group choose to make a platform to sell vacation hot spots.

It was evaluated with the following results:

* Feature Completeness:
* Views:
* Controllers:
* Models:
* Testing:
* Usability:
* Workflow:

## D: Professional Skills

Throughout each module we have workshops with the Community Affairs Manager, Employment Coordinator, as well as the Partnership Manager to effectively prepare for our career.  I really enjoy this part of the module because it gives us the opportunity to work on skills that translate directly to the industry.  The program stretches us to become better version of ourselves, which in turn makes us better programmers.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This workshop really reinforced and gave me the confidence to know that I am not alone in my struggle to take on all these new topics.  Turing is an intense program that really pushes your learning skills to the limit.  I really enjoyed Kathy Sierra's video when she repeated that no one is a unicorn, we all have to work hard to get what we want.  It was very interesting to find out the limit of knowledge that was discovered in the studies she talks about.  So many times at Turing you feel that you have to remember everything.  I realized in Module 2 that there is definitely a limit.  

I pride myself on my Ruby programming and felt I had a great grasp on solving complex problems with Ruby.  During Module 2, after stretching myself to learn all the new topics in Active Record and not working much in Ruby, it seemed like I needed a quick refresher when I would, all of a sudden, switch over to Ruby.  It really taught me that I will never be done learning and getting better.  Although I have a good grasp on Ruby programming, I learned that it doesn't come automate.  I still have to use cognitive resources when I go back to Ruby.  This session taught me how making processes automatic and splitting up learning into small sub skills increases mental capacity.  Instead of getting great at everything all at once, perfecting one thing at a time, with practice, will prove the best way to become a great programmer.  Ta-Nehisi Coates' short article gave me reassurance that even when you don't see the light at the end of the tunnel, if you take small steps, keep fighting, and struggle long enough, eventually you will accomplish what you are after.

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This session was very beneficial to reinforce best practices when working with others in a team.  Team work is crucial at Turing and from the first pairings in Module 1, you learn how important team dynamics are to creating a successful product.  I learned how involved pair programming is from a bad experience that I was able to learn from.  After Module 1, I learned that you must address issues as they come up.  In a general work environment, you can usually avoid toxic people, or limit your exposure, and still get your work done. Pair programming is a much more intimate environment, where you really have to work well with others in the group.  You cannot let something go unsaid because your well being and commitment to the project directly relate to how much time and consideration you give the code.  If you are having problems with the group, it shows in your final project, where time tables are key and enthusiasm about your project bring better results. I really enjoyed our group discussions because we had one student from Module 1, and one student from Module 4.  I was able to give my experience to the Module 1 student and learn from an experienced Module 4 student.  It was interesting to hear how being a project manager increases your confidence in your coding abilities.  I want to push myself to be the project manager in one of our projects so I can gain the experience.  The video we watch was focused around, something I take very seriously, treating others how you want to be treated and giving others the benefit of the doubt that they are doing the best they can.  Many times in groups, we tend to think the other person is falling short and you are working harder than others.  It is important to step back and really appreciate others input and use what that are good at for the benefit of the group.

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Debugging the Gender Gap was a very interesting video that we watch during one of the sessions on Friday.  It is one of the most controversial topics in the industry and Turing is striving hard to make a difference.  I chose to be part of the group that tries helps Turing bring diversity into the program.  We broke up into small groups and had great discussions about the issue at large.  Since I am in the larger demographic, the discussion really brought light to the issues faced by the minority.  It is very hard to realize what is going on unless you are presented the facts.  We came to the conclusion as a group that knowledge is the only way to change the way the industry operates.  We discussed how much of what is going on is unseen, or unrecognized, by the industry because of subconscious programming influenced by the media companies.  It's hard to fault an individual for the actions brought on by generations of influence. Recognizing the issues and hearing first had from women in the industry is the only real steps to take towards change.  We discussed how important awareness is, and want to make it a requirement for every Turing grad to take part in an awareness activity outside of Turing.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/MDes41/45c4c8d50ded9e69912f16beb617c585)

This session with Lia was focussed around branding yourself and leaving yourself open to opportunities in every way possible. It was valuable to learn from her experience the best ways to stand out.  This is one area that I am going to focus on going forward.  I do not have a strong web presence and learned I need to be more active networking.  She went over all the major sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and great blogging sites.  I was interested in her approach to marketing yourself.  Companies really hire you for who you are and want to get to know you from your online presence.  I am going to go to more conferences, like she recommended, as well.  It is a great place to meet people and get involved with others in the industry.  

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

* After working on our group project, we had an opportunity to meet with Alison and discuss what when well with the team dynamics, what didn't go well, and other project management strategies we could focus on going forward.  I was lucky to work in a group where the project seemed to come together like magic.  We had no disagreements in the group that brought us down and seemed to have a relaxed, productive, working environment throughout the project.  One of the big reasons for the success of our team, was the great DTR we had at the beginning of the project.  Each team member took a turn to discuss their working style, the best way to communicate with them, and how they would like to be treated throughout the project.  It was a group consensus that each members ideas be respected.  We must support each others learning by mutual respect for each other.  This creates an environment where everyone feels safe to express their idea's, disagreements, or ask for help from other team members.  

* Along with a great initial DTR, our group came together at the end of the project to discuss what we could have done better and give each other feedback individually. We focused directly on how each member could get better going forward and what we could have done better.  The only thing that could have gone better was to make sure we address the changes to meeting times.  Because the communication and project went so well, we did not need to have group meetings every morning that we agreed to have at the beginning of the project.  Instead of getting together and deciding not to have at meeting, the meetings seemed to fall to the wayside and we worked on individual tasks.  This did not affect us in this project, but we made sure to take note that it could pose a problem in future projects.  I was particularly upset one day when I showed up for a meeting that did not happen.  I got feedback from the group that I must speak up during those times and address the group with my feelings.  I am a pretty easy going person, but realize after talking with Alison that something like this could cause problems in the future if not brought up right away  In a longer project, the same issue could happen again and again if not discussed.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Feedback for Dan Broadbent**
I really enjoyed working with Dan on our final group project for Module 2.  His experience working with others shows right away.  He is a natural at focusing on what needs to be done and keeping on track in agile development.  I can see from his work style that he has led many teams and knows how to work well with any team member.  I respected Dan’s ability to think outside the box and recommend creative ideas for the project that would make it better.  He is dedicated to becoming a great programmer and his previous business and technical experience make him an asset to any team.

**Feedback for Ryan Workman**
Ryan and I had to opportunity to work together on our second group project, called Little Shop, and were paired together multiple times in class to work through exercises or to evaluate each other’s projects.  I was immediately impressed by Ryan’s work and intellectually abilities. Ryan was our project manager for Little Shop, and time and time again his understanding of how the pieces fit together proved valuable. I appreciated Ryan making sure everyone was involved in the process because I know he was trying to stretch himself to be a part of, and build a more cohesive team.  He continually tries to do things better than the last time, and this project proved how he can bring a team together.  As far as I can see Ryan will make a great programmer and leader in the industry as he keeps asking for feedback and stays responsive to others he works with.

**Feedback for Ben Pepper**
Ben made me feel very welcomed to join the cohort at the beginning of the module, and we had the opportunity to work together on our first group project, called Rush Hour.  His natural ability to connect with others in the group, through respect and attentiveness, made him great to pair with.  Ben can handle any code problem or task delegated to him, as he did every night when we split up tasks.  I found him always available to reach out to when something came up, and thought his thorough communication with team members throughout the project led to our success.  Ben already has the skills necessary to work on any team and makes a great programmer as he continues his learning.  

**Feedback for Jean Joeris**
Jean and I worked together in a three-person group, on our first group project in Module 2, called Rush Hour. He took the the role as project manager and proved to be an outstanding leader.  From the very beginning of the project, I took note of Jean’s ability to stay receptive to others feedback and ideas.  When a team member was stressed or quite, Jean would notice right away and ask if they needed to switch roles or if they needed a quick break.  He valued each person’s input and treated each member equally when delegating responsibility for the project.  I have great respect for Jean in his ability to lead a team and really appreciated him asking at the end of the project how he could have done better.  I didn’t have much feedback to give him because I thought the communication and delegation of tasks was handled very professionally.  I know that Jean has the ability to lead teams through tough waters in the future, but this project seemed to come together in all ways.  

### Being a Community Member

**Feedback for Dan Broadbent**
"Matt - It was great getting to work with you on the Little Shop project and getting to know you better.  You are calm and collected and did a great job letting things go smoothly but also making your point known when there was a disagreement about where the direction should go.  You had a great understanding of the project and definitely taught us a few things about CSS.  You’re an awesome coder and easy to work with.  I’d be happy to have you in my group again."

**Feedback for Ryan Workman**

**Feedback for Jean Joeris**
"I really enjoyed working with Matt. He was very friendly and hard working. I really appreciated his willingness to not go on autopilot and question our design decisions. I believe the whole team was improved by this, as our choices became more mindful. There was no distance between him and the rest of the group, which was impressive given that he was new to our cohort. He  had a happy attitude the entire project, which was nice. I hope Matt continues to keep his cool level head, as it is a boon to any groups he is on"

### Playing a Part

* I came into this Module after a break and made it a priority to be part of the community.  Luckily for me, the cohort I came into was a very special group that welcomed me to a great team.  I really enjoyed our time outside of Turing, going to lunches and dinners as a group.  I was able to get to know everyone quickly which helped build strong teams when working on projects.

* I really like sharing what I have learned with others and signed up to help the Module 1 students whenever I had time.  This enabled me to meet the new students who just joined Turing and help them, when I could, with something that was new to them.  

* Friday spikes are when the community comes together and discuss controversial topics related to the industry.  I participated every Friday, because I enjoy coming together as a community and discussing hard topics with other smart individuals.  I also participated in every lunch roulette so that I could meet as many other Turing peers as I could.

* I was a part of the Bezos posse through out the module.  I thought this posse would be a good idea because of the community it builds working with other peers. We had the opportunity to work on a gem that would package Amazon's API key and do the setup work to make API calls to the web site.  I really enjoyed pairing with other peers from different modules to work on a product.

* I also stepped in on the Armstrong posse when they wrote a simple program to map a neural connection.  We met in small groups, using test driven development, to work through a problem.
