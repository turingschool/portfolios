## A: End of Module Assessment

Jeff Casimir  
Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

* Pretty decent with syntax and concepts
* Nervousness slows things down a bit
* Able to talk through / think through ideas on the fly
* Some struggles mapping out a pseudocode / concept
* Seems like good vocabulary/tools, but struggling to put together the story
* Connect with Dave Mauer -- similar situation
* Struggling with the abstractions

## Rubric

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This is a collection of individual projects I completed during the module.

#### Jungle Beats

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/Jungle_beats.git
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown

Jungle Beats was a project that taught us the fundamental data structures of computer science the Linked List. It also helped to teach us how to interact with the command line from within the program, 'BEEP-BOOP-DEE'.

## Assessed By: Mike

## Notes:
* Testing did not cover all cases with methods implemented.
* Effective use of iterative approach
* Pop method not functional, and to string method.

## Scores:


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion


* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter
* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/Event_Reporter.git
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

Event Reporter introduced us to CSV and HTML usage within Ruby. The concept here was to be able to sort through a database and return the searched information. It also taught us how to link up the program with a user interface. I throughly enjoyed this project and while I did not score all threes, I feel successful. One of my goals, was to complete it without pairing. The purpose of doing it this was to push my own learning by having to figure things out for myself. And I think that it was good thing for me to do.

Notes:


### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

### 2. REPL Interface
* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 7. HTML and Style
* 3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This is a collection of group projects I completed over the course of the module.

#### Enigma

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/Enigma.git
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

Enigma was awesome, I loved the idea of recreating the Enigma machine. It was super fun trying to figure out how to do that.

Assessed By: Jeff

Repo:

Notes:

* 28 tests all pass, one skip
* Tests are overall good growth, don't quite feel fluent/full, but good progress
* implementation is pretty good
* some over-use of instance variables
* a little bit of leaky abstraction when encapsulating functionality
* watch out for "code smells" that show you weakness

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

From Nick:
Robbie and I were paired up for the Enigma project in module one and even as we struggled to communicate effectively throughout, we managed to complete it. During the retro, Robbie was open and honest in discussing the issues he believed led to the communication breakdown. It was enlightening to hear exactly what I need to improve on in the future to be a better working pair and professional. I admire Robbie's work ethic and ability to stay focused on problems until they are complete. 
HeadCount built upon the lessons learned in EventReporter. HeadCount taught us how to import multiple CSV files, organize them into hashes and then perform statisical analysis on them.

#### HeadCount

* https://github.com/mscherer11/headcount.git
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

EventReporter on steroids,crack, and a little PCP.

Assessed By: Mark

Repo: https://github.com/mscherer11/headcount

Notes:
* test suite - 69 runs, 131 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97% coverage
* test harness - 1 failure, 0 errors
* generally good separation of logic across different classes and modules
* test coverage is adequate, but could use more edge cases and unit tests
* sanitation failures due to long method names


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 3: Five or fewer complaints



From Mike:
Robbie is a great partner.  During our Headcount project, he showed determination, organization, and teamwork.  He was constantly open to working when convenient for both of us, kept things light and positive, and was generally a team-player.On the final night of the project, he stayed well past midnight to finish when it was not required of him.  I think this shows a lot about his character; he is someone with whom you'd want to share a foxhole.  His attention to detail made him a great partner, and I enjoyed working with him on this project.  An opportunity for Robbie is to be unafraid to sketch out/whiteboard/conceptualize ideas before bringing them to the forefront.  Overall, I enjoyed working with him, and I think he will be successful at Turing and beyond.

## D: Professional Skills
This covers some of the concepts that we covered to help us work better within teams.

### Gear Up
#### There is an "I" in "Team"

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

This was a good Gear Up. I've been involved in a lot of different types of teams, and I think that reflecting on the various teams and how they worked was valuable. I think that this reflection helped me to determine which path I would like to take here at Turing and beyond. One thing I would like to add is that I think team work here at Turing involves me having to try to explore my feelings more, because we are all going through this process together and we should explore the areas that make us uncomfortable.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

While I appreciated the idea behind the gear up, I personally did not get a lot out of it, however I think that to subject is important and should be brought up especially for the new students. I felt like the core of the material was about not giving up (grit) and pushing through "bad" feelings and into success. 


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Strengths-Finder

LinkedIn profile:
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-smith-66108859
* I plan on updating it in the next module.

1) Completed the strengths finder quiz

* Over the course of the module, I had a one-on-one with Allison and also particpated in the strengths-finder group. I think that the strengths finder quiz not only helped to reaffirm some of my personal beliefs, it also helped to dig into some of the issues that could hold me back from having a productive career. While I don't necessarily like participating in these meetings, I recognize that growth comes from doing uncomfortable things and ultimately this will be good for my personal and professional life. 

Lia's First PD Talk
* We did not get any deliverables this module. However, it was nice to hear her speak on the topics personal branding and how Twitter and Linked In are used in the tech community. All of this stuff is pretty new me and a little overwhelming, while I am hesitant to create a Twitter account, I am open to the idea and plan on exploring it more here in the near future.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Anthony:
Anthony has provided me a lot of help over the course of the module. There were numerous times where I was stuck on a problem and ended up asking Anthony for help. Anthony was always more than willing to help me and he was very patient with me when it took me a bit to get the concept. I really appreciate the time he took to help me out. Aside from the academic help he provided, we also had some really good conversations during the module. 

To Nick:
Nick and I worked on Enigma together, while the project was successful we struggle with some communication issues throughout the project. I am glad that I was partnered with Nick during this process. After the project, Nick and I were able to maturely discuss our shortcomings and not only was Nick able to give constructive feedback, he was also able to receive my feedback. And this maturity is valuable in growing and becoming a better team member in the future. The feedback he gave me, has also helped me in the current paired project to be more aware of my communication shortcomings.

To Mike: 
Working with Mike has been a great experience. This whole process of learning at Turing has been very humbling for me. While working with Mike it was evident that he is the stronger partner and often times Mike would put the pieces together before I was able to. The reason I say this, is because I ended up asking a lot of questions and needing to be brought up to speed on what is going on. Mike was incredibly patient with me and took the time to explain things to me and ask me to elaborate on my thoughts. He did all of this in very nice manner and without a condescending attitude. I don't think just writing that in a sentence can do justice to the amount of patience that Mike has. I think that it shows a lot about the type of person that he is, that he can work in a team and not leave the weaker partner behind. It was also great for me to watch his brainstorming and organizational process, I learned a lot from just observing. My only constructive criticism that I have for Mike is that he needs to take more walks when he gets stuck on a problem, and to try to work on not letting the problem frustrate him.

To Brad:
Brad and I paired up a bit during Event Reporter.Pairing with Brad was very easy to do, and it is always nice work with someone who is humble and kind. I think that Brad's demeanor is something to be valued. I was trying to think of more eloquent way to put this, but I haven't been able to. So, with that said, it was just nice to be around someone with his characteristics. It made the brainstorming and working process easier.

To Noah:
It has been really awesome getting to know Noah this module. Everyday he has been positive and ready to work. Last night we were all in classroom B trying to wrap up HeadCount and it was great to see him rallying and pushing to get it done. We also shared some pretty sweet laughs too and I think that having his sense of humor around is a good assest to the community.

### Being a Community Member

Robbie is a great addition to any team. He has a very outgoing and helpful attitude. He has made this module great by reaching out when he sees you struggling and always has a suggestion of how to solve your problem. This collaborative nature is very welcomed in this feild and I will continue to collaborate and work with him in the future. - Dan Olson

Robbie and I worked together a lot on our projects and drills. He is really approachable and honest which made my first couple of weeks here much easier. Robbie helped me a lot at the beginning of the mod when I was timid approaching other classmates. He was always open on giving advice an helping me set up my pry/seeingisbelieving in the proper way. We also were able to bounce ideas off of each other during the Event Reporter project. If he doesn't understand a topic he is determined to get to the bottom of it before moving on to the next problem. - Anthony Ciccone

Robbie is a an intelligent and careful programmer, always willing to discuss a problem with his cohort-mates and work towards a solution. Definitely an asset to the community, of which he is a generous  member, once giving me a ride home in the middle of a rainstorm. It has been great getting to know him over the course of the mod. - Noah Berman

### Playing a Part

This module, I did not play as much of a part as I felt like I could. While my focus during this module was to lay a good foundational framework in programming, I attempted where I could to give back. Some examples include: replacing toilet paper when I noticed it was empty, replacing paper towels, replacing sugar when it was empty, picking up trash and/or dishes when I noticed that were left out. I also gave people rides home(when I drove) so that they didn't have to walk or use the bus..etc. For module 2 I would like to give back by pairing with new module 1 students.
