# Eric Wahlgren-Sauro - Module 1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

*This module, I set out to affirm my growth mindset as I start out on the journey of becoming a software developer. Since before my interview, I recognized that this would be one of the hardest things I've taken on. I worked my ass off to learn as much as I could over the last six weeks -- averaging 70 hours per week. Unfortunately, my results were substandard thus I'm opting to repeat this module. My weakest areas of performance were enumerables and breaking down problems into small logical chunks. I perform poorly when I'm not able to talk a problem out with another person. My greatest strength is my ability to collaborate with others on problems.*

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

*These projects were very difficult. I never gave up, but I frequently left confused as I went through each. I've learned a TON and can't wait to get back to it in 1610!*

#### Jungle Beat

* [Github URL](https://github.com/cews7/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

*The reasoning behind this project was to get students familiar with the concept of a linked-list and understand how they work by implementing one.*

**Assessed By: Jeff Casimir**

*Notes:*

* **28 tests, all passing**
* **good test progression**
* **good clean implementation**
* **look for opportunities to pull out small chunks of code into named methods**
* **overall good work**

*Evaluation:*

* **3:** Application fulfills all base expectations
* **3:** Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*The aim of this project was to get students comfortable parsing data from CSV files*

**Assessed By: Mike Dao**

*Notes:*

* **Tests do not run, export to csv and html doesnt work**
* **Program does crash during happy path**
* **No significant testing**

*Evaluation:*

* **1:** Application crashes during normal usage
* **3:** Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
* **1:** Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
* **2:** Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

*Enigma was what I'd consider to be a disaster. Neither my partner or I knew what we were doing throughout the project. We were both struggling to understand basic concepts in Ruby at this point in the module, never-mind the actual logic of the problem. Headcount was less challenging due to having a skilled partner. He drove and navigated most of the project. Despite our mutual success on the project, I still feel shaky on how to apply concepts utilized throughout the project.*

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cews7/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

*The aim of this project was to get us comfortable using hashes, and breaking down a hard logic problem into smaller steps.*

**Assessed By: Jeff Casimir**

*Notes:*

* **24 tests with 4 failing**
* **lots of tiny code smells to work on simplifying**
* **watch out for the little things like mismatching names (off_set vs offset) and indentation**
* **in the end it looks like a good learning project**
* **try writing code then throwing it away**

*Evaluation:*

* **2:** Application is missing one of the three operations
* **2:** Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* **2:** Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* **3:** Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

* **Team Dynamic:** Anthony and I worked hard on Enigma. We stayed late every night working on it and I never sensed we were on the verge of giving up. This was the result of plenty of laughter and seeing the context of our situation.*

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cews7/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

*The aim of this project was to gain proficiency working with large datasets, HASHES, and breaking down problems into logical components and much more.*

**Assessed By: Mark Miranda**

*Notes:*

* **Test Harness - iteration 0 through 5 passes with 0 failures and 0 errors**
* **Test Suite - 94 tests, 327 assertions, 99% coverage**
* **very consistent testing across repositories and models. easy to ready and understand**
* **great separation of responsibilities among private methods and modules**

*Evaluation:*

* **3:** Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6
* **4:** Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data**
* **3:** Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* **4:** Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:** Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* **4:** Zero complaints

* **Team Dynamic:** We were very cooperative and took everything one small step at a time together. If Alisher had an idea he'd share it with me before implementing most of the time. Likewise if I had an idea I'd try to share it before typing it out to respect the codebase. He navigated and drove most of the project. I lacked the confidence to drive most of the time and I probably should have more, but when I did drive I felt I understood what was going on in the project. Overall I'd rate this pairing experience a 10/10."

## D: Professional Skills
*The skills learned in this module included: learning how to structure a resume and LinkedIn profile, and learning how to make a successful team out of any team.*

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

*I realized I have serious pileup on B. Most of the time when I'm programming I feel like I have no idea what the next thing I'm going to type is. It's gotten better as the module has gone on, but by repeating I will move a lot more knowledge from B to C -- i.e. mastery.*


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Learning to Pair)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/cews7/headcount/blob/master/DTR%20Headcount.pdf)

*I learned the importance of creating a DTR with my teammate. It proved invaluable in setting Alisher and I on the right path in our Headcount project.*

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Jon Kimble**
* *Jon, you are team Zen in 1608. I always hear you laughing which lightens my spirits on hard days — oh, wait that’s everyday. You offered me excellent techniques in managing stress, I’m grateful for it.*

**Anthony Ciccone**
* *Anthony kept me in good spirits throughout the project. We had many struggles, but he remained determined. I specifically remember working on the encrypt method and how relentless he was in finding a solution. We stayed pretty late one night and I wanted to go home, but Anthony treated the task of teaching me how the encrypt method worked as a personal moral obligation. Once he figured it out, his excitement skyrocketed and it became clear how much he loved his work, inspiring me to work harder*

**Alisher Sadikov**
* *Alisher was an amazing partner for Headcount. He took his time in explaining every detail of his thought process to me, taking considerable energy at moments when I didn’t fully understand how a component of the program was working. I learned a ton in the last two weeks of this module as a result of his guidance. He made me feel like there was never a challenge too big for us to take on. Anytime I had a concern about how we were approaching a problem he always took my point-of-view into account. He is one of the hardest working people I’ve encountered at Turing*

**Susi Irwin: Imposters**
* *The imposters lunches since week one have given me great comfort in knowing that I’m not alone in this death march to coding success. Before I had my final  assessment for this module, Susi reminded me of familiar techniques to stay calm during the assessment. Although I did not pass my assessment her reminding me to voice my anxiety to Beth made me feel less alone as I worked through the material.*
### Being a Community Member

**Anthony Ciccone**
* *Eric was great to work with during the Enigma project and overall an awesome person to have in our Mod. I think we were both having a tough time grasping the concept at first for Enigma but were able to give it our best effort when making a final push to complete the project. Eric is always super communicative and honest. He always wants to understand the deeper meaning why to certain questions he has which often proved useful when I may have wanted to rush through a topic. Eric and I worked together on a lot of the mythical-creatures drills. He was great to bounce ideas off of and even screenheroing a couple late nights in order to finish them.*

**Alisher Sadikov**
* *I have really enjoyed working and collaborating with Eric, both within and outside the project we worked on. For our pair project Headcount, he was always on time and ready to put in the required amount of effort into a certain task we had to accomplish. In general, when I think of Eric the first thing that comes to my mind is how important it is to first formulate the right questions instead of trying to answer them. He has excellent communication skills and pretty good grasp of programming fundamentals, as well as classic and proven way of problem solving (such as whiteboarding algorithms and brainstorming ideas etc.) He is a very hard-working student and I guarantee he will soon become one of the top students at Turing.*

**Jon Kimble**

* *Eric, it has been great being in mod 1 with you! It is inspiring to see your positive attitude, growth mindset, and longterm approaching when it comes to coding. You hold yourself to a high standard and seek opportunities to learn more and expand your knowledge and this lifts up the whole mod. I am consistently impressed by the questions you ask in class and the armstrong posse; they spark all of our curiosity and help us learn more. You engage with others in a meaningful way, work hard while maintaining the groups moral, and are a strong asset to any team.  If I have any actionable feedback for you it would be to ask more questions in class because we all benefit from them!*

### Playing a Part

*I made an effort to talk with Tessa one day when she was having a difficult time working through what to do next in her life. She opened up to me and I made sure to give her my full attention while she spoke about her experience at Turing and how it fit into the context of her life as a whole.*
