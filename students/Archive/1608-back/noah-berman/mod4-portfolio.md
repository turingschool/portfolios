# Noah Berman - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to become as job-ready as possible. I also wanted to gain an understanding of javascript and deepen my knowledge of DevOps and security concepts. I also wanted to make sure that the posse I co-lead (Pahlka) was set up as much as possible for continuing on into the future.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Open Source! It's fun, it's a challenge, it's a thing that we did! It was great to get to "give back" to the community I make so much use of in my own projects.

Sidenote: for my docs PR I had to submit an issue rather than a PR, as the docs I was trying to fix are not open for PRs.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The Crucible. The Cauldron. The Complete Set Of Mod4 Projects.

#### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cdunagan05/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

This was an overwhelming project - I hadn't had the chance to do much with client-side Javascript prior to this mod beginning and it made everything just that much more difficult. I think it went alright considering the circumstances -- and we worked _hard_ for what we got -- but in the end we weren't able to complete functionality.

Notes from Jeff:

- We cut scope in the previous meeting, but ended with un-started cards and un-finished cards
- App functionality feels a bit "prototype" / rough
- Some calorie totaling
- We pushed off the removing
- Can change dates but not really update the meals and date-related info
- Nice in-place editing of foods and searching of the list
- A few tests in place but not a ton of coverage
- JS syntax is fine
- Would like to see a bit more use of OO-style JavaScript, breaking up functions and responsibilities
- Git looks good
- PMing shows progress but isn't quite clean -- break down stories into smaller pieces, finish them

Scores from Jeff:

Functional Expectations: 2

Testing: 2

HTML/CSS/UI: 3

JS syntax and Style: 2

Git Workflow: 3

Project Management: 2

#### Code of Arms -- 1st Sprint

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/code-of-arms)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

Code of Arms is an Exercism-like application designed for (at the very least) Turing internal use. It was the only 'greenfield' capstone this inning and in some ways this was lucky, in others not so much. We were able to architect the thing from the ground up, with help from Sal, Bree, and Mike -- and that was an interesting experience. We were able to get it into production (despite much struggling with Census) in MVP status by the end of the sprint, which was pretty great.

Scores from Mike:

Project Management: 4

Completion & Pace: 4

Implementation Quality: 3.5

Application of Techniques: 3

#### Code of Arms -- 2nd Sprint

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/code-of-arms)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

We entered this sprint focusing on getting our app into true MVP status. I took on the responsibility of notifications. I wound up deciding to experiment with React (and build them with the same) -- which was an interesting if at times extremely frustrating challenge. Was good to get some experience with React, though. We also did a lot of work to set ourselves up for success with Joust, our secondary project. I wound up getting to put my previous life's writing skills to use cleaning up and writing portion of the docs (though everyone contributed a section or two). 

Scores and comments from Mike:

All stories complete.
Documentation is clean and complete.
Some opportunities to refactor in controllers.

Project Management: 4

Completion & Pace: 3

Implementation Quality: 3

Application of Techniques: 4

Documentation: 4

Feedback to me from Erin Pintozzi: "Noah was a great teammate during the capstone. He has a great enthusiasm and imagination for coming up for creative solutions to problems and ideas for features of the app.  Our app implemented some new tools and techniques that we learned throughout the mod because Noah had so much excitement for experimentation."

Feedback to me from Anna Dolan: "Code of Arms was my second project with Noah, although we hadn't worked together since mod 1. He was able to write a lot of great code while adding a lot of humor and camaraderie to the group. He was always available to vent to when I was frustrated, and is generally very supportive to others. With his creativity and code skills combined, I know Noah is going to make some amazing things after Turing!"

Feedback to me from Nicholas Martinez: "Working and arguing with you throughout Turing has been a blast. Somehow we manage to agree on everything and disagree on everything at the same time. Critically speaking, I believe you need to work on how you describe what it is you are working on to team members, particularly if they are getting frustrated over it. Your problem solving ability and knowledge about an abundance of all things internet is a great resource and invaluable to to any team."

#### Joust

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/joust)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/secondary)

This was a good chance to test out our work - making sure that interacting with Code of Arms was as easy or usable as we'd hope. We paired a little bit differently for this project and it was good to experiment with different ways of contributing to a project at this level of complexity. 

Feedback from Nate:

* I like the consistent style with code of arms
* It seems like a good start, but a lot of the "sticky" functionality is yet to come

Feedback from Jeff: 

- Problem: too much free time, opportunity to hone skills, be better developers
* Get two solutions from the same exercise on Code of Arms
* PLEASE DON'T TYPE "LKHJGSDFG" IN YOUR DEMOS!
* Tracker: good progress, some stories in the backlog, add some filtering
* Shame: Showing Sal a thing that didn't work, turned out to just have Pry
* Proud: use of the Code of Arms API, neat to build other things
* Improved the CoA API to allow the functionality
* "How do you see the comments?" "`rails c`"

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### The Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

It was nice to get a sense of the way technology can be used to simplify and explain larger social issues. I was disappointed that we didn't discuss the actual tragedy of the commons especially as it related to technology - singular bad actors have had really shockingly evident effects within the shared ecosystem of the internet. Consider the NSA, or Metallica, or the people responsible for last year's major botnet attack. We also could have discussed whether it was even valid to describe behaviors like these in strictly economic terms... I also wonder - thinking about it after the fact - if using 'the tragedy of the commons' to discuss quotas + affirmative action has a strange connotation.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

We had a great conversation in my small group about the potential directions a response to greater automation could take. Throughout I was thinking a lot about the [Four Futures](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/12/four-futures/) article -- rather than approaching this as "work needs to change" we need to think about how society as a _whole_ can change. By trying to frame the conversation in these terms - rather than "how can we maintain the status quo in the midst of great change" - we were able to have a very productive discussion.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In the wake of increasing automation we need to re-think the way we help our fellow humans survive — just dolling out cash won’t do it. If we don’t need people to do these jobs why don’t we create conditions (socialized housing, universal healthcare, socialized food etc) that allow people to exist and do as they please rather than forcing them into another form of wage slavery. 

If we MUST have UBI we need to make sure that the people most affected are the ones who already have it - namely, the rich. $2000 per person over the age of 18 (as is sometimes floated) is not enough - it must reach or exceed the living wage, and must be granted (as they say on airplanes) “per soul” - placed in secure bank accounts limited to that person. Imagine the ways it could help people — LGBTQ kids who are unable to leave their parents, for example — if it’s provided timely and sufficiently for them to make their mistake. We also cannot allow it to take the place of easily acquired healthcare (at least) because prices will surely rise.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback from me to Chase Dunagan: "It was kind of unfortunate that Chase and I first got to work together on such a high-stress project, but we were able to work well and got quite a lot done considering our lack of JS knowledge. Chase's willingness to dive into new (and by the end increasingly ridiculous) solutions made a very stressful time less agonizing. Thanks for struggling through Quantified Self with me!"

Feedback from me to Erin Pintozzi: "I feel fortunate to have been able to work with Erin on our capstone project. As a group we wound up doing a lot of our work separately, and Erin would not only come in every day with problems solved and great code written, but with ideas for how to improve features while staying within the scope of the project. (!) The skills she brings from her "previous life" also came in super handy - graphic design for our hella great shield logo, project management for our project... management. Looking forward to seeing where her career takes her!"

Feedback from me to Anna Dolan: "Anna and I have a track record of working on capital-p Projects together - first "Headcount" at the end of mod1, now our Capstone Project/s at the end of mod4. I'm glad we got to work together again and especially on this project! She writes great code and her tenacity when problem solving has always been a major asset. When we found out that Joust (our secondary project) would need to pull data from Code of Arms she volunteered to create an API for us, went home, and then the next day we had an API. Skillz. Has been great working with Anna throughout the mod, I'm sure she's gonna do great things in the post-Turing world!"

Feedback from me to Nicholas Martinez: "Nick and I have had an ongoing political, er, debate throughout our time here at Turing. The skills he brings to bear in that conversation show themselves in his programming work: his tenacity, his willingness to go from zero to 400% in terms of solivng problems, his knowledge about what we're working on. Was great to finally get to work with Nick on a project - we've been discussing DevOps stuff for a while now but this was our first time collaborating on a project. He's a major asset to any team and I look forward to both our continued debate and seeing where his skillz take him."

Feedback from me to Sam Johnson: "We kind of ambushed Sam with the offer to co-lead Pahlka Posse at the end of last mod, and he has taken on the position with skill and enthusiasm. His work in trying to obtain more resources for Pahlka as well as building our engagement with mods 1 + 2 has been and continues to be incredibly valuable in terms of Pahlka's continued existence. Thanks so much for your willingness to take the helm of the good ship Pahlka Posse, and #pahlkaforever!"

Feedback from me to Nick Chambers: "Nick has always been one of the most stalwart members of Pahlka Posse -- whether that's arranging and then leading a remote interview in a matter of days or bringing mad front end skills to our various projects or any number of other things. He was also willing to help me troubleshoot a persistent React problem on our capstone project (that I had caused because of... reasons) during a week when we were all feeling the time crunch. I look forward to seeing the wild and extremely good things he makes as his career no-doubt takes off!"

### Being a Community Member

Feedback to me from Ali Schlereth: "Noah has done a great job leading Pahlka for a second inning. I really appreciated his perserverance in making sure we had solid Spike content/plans and rallying the troops each week when so many of us didn't have the energy. Thank you for your enthusiasm and dedication. Pahlka for life! (Also, yay Pahlka twitter account!)"

Feedback to me from Stephanie Andrews: "Noah has led quite a few Pahlka Spike sessions this module and always does so with enthusiasm and a solid plan of action.  The Twitter Bot Spike was no different and it was easy for me, as a front-end student to follow along- even though it involved Ruby and a lot of necessary set up.  The only thing, that could be improved (and it’s small) is expanding on the written directions.  Overall though, it was a really engaging Spike!"

Feedback to me (re: Imposters lunch) from John Binning: "Positive:
The one where we broke out into groups was great (pizza didn’t hurt either).  I also really enjoyed the video.

Constructive:
A couple of times we didn’t really do anything.  I still enjoyed getting to know the people who came though."

Feedback to me from Sam Johnson: "Noah, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to get more involved with Pahlka this mod.  You did a LOT of the heavy lifting - especially with the Spikes you led - and I appreciated that. Im going to do my best to carry on the tradition!

One piece of small constructive feedback that I would give you is that I do think there were times this mod where there was some room to involve me a bit more as a co-lead.  For instance, I offered to help/brainstorm/etc on the first spike around Civic Tech but didn’t hear anything - to be honest, it was a bit awkward to then find out that you and Ali had partnered and were presenting. I suspect this is mostly the result of time constraints/etc with your Mod4 work, but thought I’d mention it as something to consider/reflect on in the future."

Feedback to me from Nick Chambers: "Noah has been a kickass leader in the Pahlka posse and a good dude to get to know. I've always enjoyed listening to him speak publicly, and I'm not sure if he knows this or not, but he's quite good at it. He put together an awesome session on building Twitter bots this module that I know quite a few people enjoyed. He's a wonderful dude and I hope he sticks around Denver after the dust settles."

### Playing a Part

I've co-lead Pahlka Posse for this module. We built up our membership of mod1+2 students (both front and backend) and continued to work on our education data visualizer application. I took over leadership of the Imposter's Lunch group, taking it from a slow re-birth to a well attended (and well-fed) meeting. I also participated in the public-facing demo night, taking home 3rd place for Coffee Bot! I wrote a blog post about the bot which as I write this has been cross-posted to the official [Turing blog](https://www.turing.io/blog/2017/02/20/coffee-command). 

In terms of deliverables:

- I've led a couple of Friday Spikes - one, an intro to Civic Tech, the other, a guide to building your own twitter bot. (The repo for the latter one is [here](https://github.com/bermannoah/pahlka-tweets).)

- I gave a lightning talk about Imposters Syndrome to the entire school.

- I was a contributor and effectively a "product manager" for Pahlka Posse's [Edualize](http://edualize.herokuapp.com/) project.

- I've also contributed to several Turing repos - including a [redesign](https://github.com/turingschool/today/pull/126) of the now-deprecated today.turing.io. 

- Outside of Turing, I have helped spin up a local group of activists, taking us from just me and one other guy to 45+ members. I'm a member of the organizing committee, the racial justice committee, and the technology committee.

## Final Review

### Notes

It looks like you've done a LOT. It's always fantastic to look at a portfolio and say, that's a LOT of stuff. I'm especially impressed with what you've chosen for your OSS work - the problems you're doing are both varied and _interesting_.  I can't wait to see where your curiosity and great attitude take you next.

### Outcome
