###Areas of Emphasis

I knew that repeating Mod 1 would mean that I would need to make sure I was stepping up.  Not only in understanding Ruby but also as a more active member of Turing.  This module has shown me that I have a better understanding on how to breaking down problems into manageable portions.  I have also learned how to effectively communicate my ideas so that other people can understand what I am thinking.

###End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Jeff

Challenge: Shopping List

Notes:

* comfortable initial start
* maybe try to move a little bit slower, keep things on one screen?
* seem comfortable working through the problem
* it's ok to be uncertain or unsteady here and there
* some little misunderstandings with the vocabulary of control flow, what's an object, a method, etc
* ability to get things done > base understandings
* spelling/thundertyping is going to cause you little bugs and frustration

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

##Work

What follows is a quick summary of the work I accomplished during my second 6 weeks at Turing.

##Individual assignments

###Credit Check

[Credit Check](https://github.com/bfpepper/credit-check)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown)

Credit Check was designed to have a user input any card number into the command line and find out if it was in fact a valid card number.  I was also able to add support for card the only have 15 digits (like Am Ex).

###Jungle Beats

[Jungle Beats](https://github.com/bfpepper/jungle-beats)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle beats is meant to have us learn about implementing linked lists in Ruby.  Since Ruby does not naturally support a true link list we had to create the system that would add beats to a string and then play that string using the command line and a given voice.

Notes:
- Nice tests, unit and integration, test names
- Extension included
- Some SRP, want to see consistency
- Some opportunities to refactor, use more diverse enumerables
- Would like to see recursion in appropriate examples

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


###Battleship

[Battleship](https://github.com/bfpepper/battleship)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

Battleship was meant to recreate the original Milton Bradley game "Battleship."  This involved having the player place their ships on a board and a computer placing it's ships on a board at random.  Then both players would fire on each other until one player had won.

####Notes:

22 tests,
Does not run
Use constants
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

####1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####2. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

####3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

####4. REPL Interface

1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

####5. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


##Group assignments

###Enigma

[Enigma](https://github.com/bfpepper/enigma)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma was a project which mimicked the original WWII German Enigma machine.  This program is able to encrypt a message using all 91 characters.  It will also print out to the screen the date to file was created and the key it used.  Using the key and date, the user can then decrypt the file as well. We also added functionality which allows the user to create a SHA256 which will be added to the end of the message making more secure. This was a fun project to work on with a partner and it was great to learn about how SHA256 keys are created.

###1. Overall Functionality
3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

###2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###3. Test-Driven Development
2.9: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

###4. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

###Black Thursday

[Black Thursday](https://github.com/bfpepper/black_thursday)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

Black Thursday was designed as a business analytics tool.  by reading in .csv files and parsing through the data the business will be able to determine the best course of action to help their business grow.

Notes:

Spec harness passes, i1-4
Test suite: 137 examples, zero failures
Sanitation: 0 errors
Nice use of ||= with ivars (hence the 3.5) - some other areas warrant improvement (redundant calling of local vars)
Completed i0-4 plus extension
Best-choice enumerables

###1. Functional Expectations
4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design

###2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

###3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3.5
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###5. Enumerable & Collections
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

###6. Code Sanitation
The output from rake sanitation:all shows...
4: Zero complaints

##Community

####Giving Feedback

Gabi has been a wonderful addition to Turing.  She is always willing to help out.  She was happy to ScreenHero with me one night to quickly look over my code to figure out what I was doing wrong.  She always has positive attitude and is a wonderful member of the Turing community.

You can't say enough positive things about Kris.  Since I met Kris he has been more than willing to help out anyone who is having a hard time, take time to listen to people and also to help people understand something better.  Kris was always willing to talk with me when I was considering repeating Mod 1 and gave me a lot of insight into what to expect.  Kris embodies so many qualities that I think Turing tries to teach that I am supremely glad I have been able to get to know him.

Jenny and I haven't paired this mod.  However, she is a wonderful friend and is always willing to talk with me and listen about whats going on.  She continues to exemplify many qualities that Turing tries to instill in the students.  She always has a smile on her face and an unwavering willingness to jump into any problem and see what happens when a method or variable is changed.  She is a wonderful person to know and associate with.

You’re a fantastic partner.  You are always willing to slow down and help make sure I understood what was going on.  You are thoughtful in your word choice and making sure people are comfortable.  Don’t have to apologize so much.  Nights where you didn’t do anything are completely fine.  Turing will take a lot out of you so taking a night off here and there is fine.  Don’t burn yourself out.  You’re a natural leader with great qualities.  I’m betting when you apologize most of the time its to things people didn’t think twice about.

####Being a Community Member

Ben has been a huge help with quick "hacks" to help improve workflow. Whether it is recommending a helpful feature in Atom, or helping me figure out how to set up a small feature that I don't understand in a program, Ben was always more than willing to help me understand what I was doing.
—Gabi Procell

You are doing fine. You understand the syntax and the theory. I think you can learn to demonstrate your understanding of code better. Right now you read the method names and variables as you come across them. Try to take a moment to comprehend what each line is doing and explain the purpose rather than the process. You were very productive during this project and did most of the work for setting up classes and repos
-Bryan Goss

Ben has been extremely helpful to me both academically and non-academically through my repeating mod1.  Academically, he was an amazing partner for Enigma and has a really great mind for organization and how to go about attacking a program.  He was definitely the driving force of the project and always had an answer for something when I had little idea of what to do next. Non academically, he is very encouraging and always willing to help me or anyone else with a problem they may be having. Overall, a great asset to Turing and our cohort.
-Nate Anderson

"I’ve seen Ben work through module 1 for the second time. He arrives early, works hard and gets assistance when he needs it. He asks great questions, listens intently and implements what he has learned. He has come along way and his improved understanding is evident. Above and  beyond that Ben is always checking in on other students. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone is doing okay and he is willing to listen when things are difficult. He is selfless with his time and that in invaluable. Ben is an asset to the community and I am happy to have the privilege of knowing him."
