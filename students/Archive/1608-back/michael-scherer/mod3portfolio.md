# Michael Scherer - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was looking to get a more in-depth understanding of the Rails framework, a better understanding of the HTTP cycle, and start learning a new language/framework.


## Rubric Scores

Fill in how *YOU* would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **D: Professional Development**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing

* 3.5: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### API Curious

During API Curious, I started with the Stream API and switched to Github. Although the Stream project didn't go as I had hoped, I gained a lot of knowledge reading production code and got exposure to a different approach to writing an API.

    *   **1: Yes**

#### Personal Project
##### Notes:
* Great project
* Was able to talk about what was learned from React
* Some room for refactoring, but overall really solid
* Testing was done in ruby, but really should be testing with selenium or
poltergeist however, understandable considering the react piece.
* Great job!

2. Code Quality
    * 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

###### Product Experience
1. User Experience

    * 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

2. Performance

    * 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.


## D: Professional Development

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Mq3-kzF00leXVwTlNZeS1BLVk/view?usp=sharing)

#### Job Search Strategies

I have put time for job searching on my calendar. This takes place every weekday morning at 8:00AM and evening at 9:00PM.  I have engaged my mentor for strategies and have reached out to others for the same.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

* Overview
  * 30% of city traffic has been attributed to "cruising" for parking.  This can be solved with simple automation and economics.  With proper pricing, resources can be allocated more efficiently.
* History
  * This is neither a new problem, nor a unique solution -- individually.  Together, dynamic pricing and automation can combine for a new approach.
* Objective
  * Success will be determined by the ability to adjust pricing based off usage of spots in a lot.  This can be measured by feeding mocking cars coming-and-going from a parking lot.
* Deliverable
  * The app will be a front-end to reserve spots and a connection to the Google vision API to determine the presence of a vehicle in an image.
* Audience
  * The experience will be geared towards drivers 18-40

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Rales Engine
* Ben Pepper
  * Ben was a great partner during Rales Engine.  He performed his work diligently, and genuinely cared about the success of the project.  While we had different work styles, Ben was easy to coordinate with, and made adjustments accordingly.  An opportunity for Ben would be to communicate his intentions better.  There were times where it was difficult to determine what he was working on, or where he was located.  All-in-all Ben was a great partner, and I think it came through in our work.

#### Cloney Island
* Brad Green
  * Brad was a great partner during Cloney Island.  He was always interested in learning during projects, and was dedicated to accomplishing the goals laid before us.  He was always ready to work, and was coordinating with him was easy.  One opportunity for Brad is to gain the confidence to work alone more often.
* Chase Dunagan
  * Chase was a good partner during Cloney Island.  He was always available to do work, and put in some good hours on the reviews api.  His guidance was important for us during the POST/PUT/etc portion of our api.  One opportunity for Chase is to better communicate his schedule and set expectations accordingly.
* Daniel Shin
  * Daniel was an awesome partner during Cloney Island.  He is always willing to put in the work necessary to have a successful project, and he takes the necessary risk to make a project highly successful.  His styling is so good - you’d think he was in the front-end program!  One opportunity for Daniel on future projects is to make sure he is taking breaks while he is working.  Overall, Daniel was a great partner and I look forward to working with him again.

### Being a Community Member

#### Rales Engine
* Ben Pepper
  * Mike was an amazing partner to work with for Rales Engine. In the beginning it was very simple to divide and conquer. As we got into the later iterations and ore complicated queries Mike was more then willing to help walk me through what was happening and was extremely patient while i was trying to visualize the database structure. One thing I would recommend, don't let yourself got sucked down rabbit holes for too long.

#### Cloney Island
* Daniel Shin
  * Mike was a great partner to work with during Cloney Island. His natural project management vision helped us facilitate the project in a clear direction. Furthermore, Mike was willing to stay late during critical moments as well as split up work due to the breadth of the project. For future projects, Mike may be able to take on more front-end tasks. Regardless, Mike helped resolve many critical issues in various scopes that helped the project become successful.
* Brad Green
  * Working with Mike on Cloney Island was very enjoyable. He is very well organized and brings structure and guidance to any team that he works on. Mike also has an impressive ability to learn new things on his own and share them with the rest of the team. One opportunity for growth would be more delegation of work.
* Chase Dunagan
  * Mike was full of great ideas and killed the J-query on our project.  He was always willing to get to work, be it night or day, and I envy him for having that ability. Mike was a crucial part of our project because he wasn’t afraid to take on some of the more difficult aspects of the project.  One constructive criticism of Mike is for him to appear more open to other people’s ideas.  Sometimes it felt like once he had his idea, it would take a lot to change it, which may have stopped me from sharing my ideas once or twice.

### Playing a Part

This mod I was a pre-work guide, and I will be in mod4.  I also spend the time to replace the coffee, and clean common areas when necessary.

### Gear Up

#### Journey Mapping
  Overall this was a good session.  It was good to hear how the other students in my group overcame adversity.  It is important to reflect on one's current situation, and realize how one ended up in their position.

#### Micro Aggression
I felt that this gear up was slightly misguided.  A lot of the materials described overt rascism/sexism/etc.  As a native New Yorker, I had a particularly strong reaction to the article that chronicled the aggressions over time.  The NYC subway can be one of the worst places to encounter people, and many of the people who make these kinds of comments have mental illnesses.

#### Grit
I think this was a good session; I liked that we had the reflection in our cohorts.  I think that grit is something that gets overused.  Often, people are not encouraged to quit something for which they have no passion or talent.  "Grit it out" has become a badge of honor, and should be rethought.  On the flip-side, persistence is necessary for achieving any goal that has been set.

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

Love the 5 on testing. Really great instincts for development. Consistently reaching outside of comfort zone. Nice thoughts on grit.
