# (Michael Scherer) - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

## Self Assessment

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

In mod 4 I set out to learn Javascript basics, start learning the React library, and get an introduction to DevOps.

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Reviewer: Nate

###### Notes:

- Nice test coverage with sad paths
- I see in your commits you started with tests, and that's great to see real TDD.
- Documentation is great to see. I'm glad we added it to the rubric. I would have liked to see a mention of the need to install `phantomjs`, and the tutorial is geared towards application use instead of towards developers.
- It looks like you duplicated the read records between the two applications. Can you explain your thinking?
- You put the `hot_read` logic in your application controller instead of the model, can you explain your thinking?
- It looks like link editing is via AJAX. Probably spent more time on that than you needed to.
- URL should be an environment variable

#### Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

###### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

###### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

###### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

###### 6. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

###### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Open Source
* [PR](https://github.com/stympy/faker/pull/835)
* [Bug Confirmation/Denial](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/582)
* [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@michael.c.scherer/turing-open-source-df1f23d177cf#.kuov9hevg)


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mscherer11/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

###### Description
Quantified-Self is a Javascript project, built to track daily calorie input and output. The user should be able to manage foods on the foods.html page and exercises on exercises.html. Daily activity can be tracked on index.html.

###### Evaluation Comments
* Teensy bug with the icon.
* 40 tests.
* Filtering requires a refresh.
* Would like to have seen some dry.
* What bugs do exist are very minor.

###### Evaluation Scores

###### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

###### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

###### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

###### JS syntax and Style

- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

###### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

###### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

###### Feedback to me
* Megan - Mike was a great partner for Quantified Self. This was a hard project and I was glad to have Mike with me for it. He is a super hard worker and never gave up. Considering this project was in a language we both know relatively little about, I was impressed by Mike's grasp of it as well as his quick ability to learn. I know we both wished we could have polished up our final product more and refactored a bit, but I was very satisifed with our progress. I know this is the end of module 4, but I would gladly work with Mike again!

###### Feedback from me
* Megan - Megan was a great partner during Quantified Self.  She was super easy-going, and I enjoyed pairing with her.  Her ability to go with the flow saved my psyche during times of severe stress.  She is super smart, learns quickly, and I think she will be a successful developer after Turing.

#### Monocle

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/monocle)
*   [Original Assignment](https://monocle.turing.io/)

###### Description
Monocle is company and job seeking tool for the Turing School community. It's purpose is to provide access to a large directory of technical companies that can be navigated in a simple and intuitive way. Once signed in, users will have the option to star companies and listings they are interested in to review at a later time. It can be accessed with a TuringSchool Census account, which you will be prompted to create from Monocle.

###### Evaluation Comments (1)

###### Feedback to me
* Alisher - "I have worked with Mike for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He is one of those people who do not get arrogant because of their smartness. This, combined with his outstanding work ethic make him an irreplaceable teammate."
* Lee - Mike it was great to get the chance to see your working style and habits more closely and I feel like I could continue to learn more about your excellent problem solving skills. You were a great asset to our team and a pleasant character to be around. I’m certain you’ll see a lot of success in your software future and thanks for all the hard work!
* Chase -

###### Feedback from me
* Alisher - Alisher was a great partner.  He is always positive, and just generally enjoyable to work with.  He was always ready to work, and his intelligence shown through while problem solving each of our issues.  I foresee great success for Alisher in the future
* Lee - Lee was a great partner to work during Monocle.  He has possibly the best work ethic of the whole cohort, and he takes great pride in all the work he completes.  I really enjoyed pairing with him due to his conscientious nature.  I learned a lot from his work habits, as well as his organization.
* Chase - Chase and I worked together in mod 2, and I have the same feedback for him no as I did then.  He is very easy to get along with, and I enjoyed pairing with him.

#### LookingFor

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/Lookingfor)
*   [Original Assignment](https://lookingFor.turing.io/)

###### Notes

* It's running SQL, and stuff, and lots of errors
* Streaming a bunch of fucked up data into Monocle
* So..why are there multiple scrapers running? How could you possibly debug this?
* LookingFor watches a queue, scrapers get jobs and drop them into the queue
* LookingFor finds the company in Monocle or creates a new one
* "Location information isn't passing Travis" - it's still unhappy
* Tracker: not good
* Inherited three scrapers, revised them, built the additional two scrapers
* Sounds like some good technical challenges, but...not convinced any of the scrapers actually work
* Risk: revised the original scrapers
* Proud of: usage of queues
* This project could have been the best of the five today, but as demoed it's basically a more messed
up version of LookingFor than we had a week ago.
* Something about needing to change the Google Maps key

## D: Professional Skills
[PD Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1608-b/michael_scherer.md)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

  Self selecting is an interesting problem.  On a small scale inherent bias can be dealt with easily, but starts to compound once you introduce more actors.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

  Thinking about how automation will impact the future is an important task.  In some respects, the morals of automation are at odds with traditional economic thought.  I thought the materials were somewhat overstated (implying that we will one day wake up without any jobs) and used poor examples (comparing horses with humans). For instance, I'd like to see me studies on how automation impacts the economy -- will it impact birth rates?

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

  Similarly to the automation gear-up, I thought the discussion on the reasons for UBI were overstated.  I actually think that UBI should be discussed outside the context of automation.  I would have liked to read more material on economic studies of UBI (they exist).
