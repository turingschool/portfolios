## B: Individual Work & Projects

I came into Turing with very little coding experience, and only had Ruby exposure through the prework.  Although I struggled through the first projects, I have since recovered and started to show my true capabilities.  Even though I didn't score as well as I could have on some of the projects, I am proud of the work I completed, and the learning that took place during them.

Feedback:
- Jon: Mike you were a fantastic teammate to have on a project, I'm really glad we got to work on a project together in module 1.  During Enigma you displayed a great attitude, worked hard, and naturally migrated to a leadership role in our group, which I think fits you well. You were aware of your teammates and concerned about their wellbeing and at the sametime were consistently producing quality code.  If there was one piece of constructive feedback I would give it would be that sometimes it's good to slow down and take a step back from the project, perhaps especially when it feels like you need to rush. I look forward to working together more in the future and you definitely add a lot to the turing community.
- Jason: Mike was great to work with. He was extremely dedicated to getting the work done. He was always willing to stay late and come in on the weekend. He was very creative in some of the ideas he had for how we could get things in our project to work. He never appeared to let the stress of the project get to him when problems would arise and would take them head which was great for the work environment.

-Working as a group of 3 was challenging. I think our group showed great fortitude in accomplishing what we could; when things started to go wrong, we prioritized and made sure we had baseline functionality working.

#### Headcount
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mscherer11/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1608-b/headcount.md)

Work in pairs to parse CSVs, run complex calculations, display data, and create a complex class structure.

-Notes:
  - test suite - 69 runs, 131 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97% coverage
  - test harness - 1 failure, 0 errors
  - generally good separation of logic across different classes and modules
  - test coverage is adequate, but could use more edge cases and unit tests
  - sanitation failures due to long method names

* 1. Functional Expectations
  - 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6
* 2. Test-Driven Development
  - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  - 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 5. Enumerable & Collections
  - 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* 6. Code Sanitation
  - The output from rake sanitation:all shows... 
  - 3: Five or fewer complaints

Feedback:
- Robbie: Working with Mike has been a great experience. This whole process of learning at Turing has been very humbling for me. While working with Mike it was evident that he is the stronger partner and often times Mike would put the pieces together before I was able to. The reason I say this, is because I ended up asking a lot of questions and needing to be brought up to speed on what is going on. Mike was incredibly patient with me and took the time to explain things to me and ask me to elaborate on my thoughts. He did all of this in very nice manner and without a condescending attitude. I don't think just writing that in a sentence can do justice to the amount of patience that Mike has. I think that it shows a lot about the type of person that he is, that he can work in a team and not leave the weaker partner behind. It was also great for me to watch his brainstorming and organizational process, I learned a lot from just observing. My only constructive criticism that I have for Mike is that he needs to take more walks when he gets stuck on a problem, and to try to work on not letting the problem frustrate him.
 

-Headcount was going great right up until the last day, when we realized that iteration 6 required a complete refactor.  We successfully fought through it to complete the project, and I'm proud of the way we worked together.

## E. Gear Up
* Getting Better at Difficult Things
    - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/edit/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown
    - Humans have scarce cognitive resources and should be conscious of how they are spent
    - Prevent leaks from the tank
    - Figure out ways to map shortcuts to becoming an expert at something by bypassing B stage (or spending less time in that bucket)
    - Practice DOES NOT make perfect if you're practicing the wrong things
* There is I in team
    - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown
    - Setting boundaries is key to maintaining your best self
    - Remaining compassionate is required to be a good teammate
    - One cannot be compassionate if they cannot take care of themselves
    - Successful team environments are hard to find
* Debugging the Gender Gap
    - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown
    - Maintaining a conscious mindset is key to overcoming diversity issues in tech
    - The bystander effect is real - those in the majority should be aware of diversity issues and should take steps to limit them
    - Opening access to those who are underserved is important to closing the gap
    - Don't lean on those effected by prejudices to police/call out issues themselves
    - Create an atmosphere of inclusion

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Erin: Although I have not working with Erin on a project, we have worked together in class, as well in the project retro.  In both cases, Erin came across as insightful, organized, and a good partner.  She is a "measure twice, cut once" type of person, which makes working with her enjoyable.  Her determination is also impressive; she worked on finding a pattern for adding/subtracting binary numbers until a solution was found (her solution ended up being shared in class).  I look forward to more opportunities to work with her in the future.

Anna: Although Anna and I didn't work on a project together, we did have time to work together in class, as well as the Engima retro. In both cases, Anna was genuine, easy to get along with, and respectful.  During our retro, it was clear that some parts of the project bothered her, but she remained understanding and true to herself.  I can see Anna being a great partner on a project, as she clearly works very hard.  I look forward to more opportunities to work with her.

Jason: Jason was a great partner during the Engima project.  Although he had the longest commute (by far!), he made coordination easy.  I distinctly remember he even missed a train on the final night of the project.  He is generally easygoing and funny, which makes working with him enjoyable.  One opportunity for Jason would be his willingness to speak up when he is either lost or in need of help.  I look forward to working with Jason again.

Jon: Jon,
It was awesome working with you on the Enigma project.  You had a lot of great insights and provided a major contribution overall.  You are thoughtful, insightful, and always willing to listen others; all of which were on display during the course of the project.  I was particularly impressed with the amount of thought that would go into anticipated logic overnight.  It was clear that you were organized, and cared about the success of the team.  You were a team-player throughout, but this was particularly on display at the end, when you agreed to take on the crack functionality alone.  I've noticed that you are always willing to contribute to the community as a whole in the same manner you contributed to our team.  Although minor and seemed to be a isolated issue (this would be feedback for the whole team), when you are feeling lost or misunderstanding, don't hesitate to speak up.  Overall, it was great working with you, and I hope we get to do it again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

Anna: I worked with Michael a handful of times this module, and I was grouped with him during the retro for our Enigma project. He was extremely sympathetic to the issues that I had with the project, and acknowledged my worries about it while helping me give my project partner the benefit of the doubt. He also was supportive to my partner and I on our Headcount project as we worked late into the night. He is a hard worker and a great source of support for people in our cohort.

Erin: Michael, though we've not been paired on a full project, the times that we've been paired for in class activities have all been really positive experiences. You seem very intentional and thoughtful in your words and coding choices which I think are great traits for a budding developer since we will be making those choices all the time both here at Turing and in the working  world. We also were paired in a reflection group and you offered great insight and advice for the topic at hand (improving paired relationships). I think you have a lot of great qualities and contributions to offer and would love to hear you continue to find ways to speak up share those ideas both in paired exercises and group discussion. Even if we're never paired together for a project, I'm looking forward to hearing more about what you have to say in class, and I'm glad you're in my cohort. 

### Playing a Part

Most of the ways I've supported the community have been informal.  I try to particpate where I can which is making coffee, cleaning the coffee maker, restocking paper towels/toilet paper, and supporting my cohort-mates when they need it.  I have also volunteered to help Lia at RMR.
