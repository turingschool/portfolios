 # Alisher Sadikov - M3 Portfolio

 ## Areas of Emphasis

 My goals for this module were:

 ## A: End of Module Assessment

 #### 1. Ruby Style: 3

 #### 2. Rails Syntax & API: 4

 #### 3. Testing: 4

 #### 4. Progression/Completion: 3

 #### 5. Workflow: 4

 ## B: Individual Work & Projects

 I worked on ApiCurious and AltFuelFinder as individual projects

 #### ApiCurious (a non-graded project)

 * [GitHub URL](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/alishersadikov/github-clone)

 It was also fun to work on Stream code and to get exposed to real life codebase.


 #### Personal Project: AltFuelFinder


 * [Original Assignment](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/alt-fuel-finder)
 * [Heroku URL](https://altfuelfinder.herokuapp.com/)

 ##### Description
 AltFuelFinder combines Google Maps API with NREL API to fetch fuel stations
 along the route, based on the approximate interval at which fuel is needed and on fuel type.
 This is the first I was exposed to kind of advanced JavaScript code as well which halted my progress a lot, especially after the launch of the project.

 ##### Evaluation Scores:
 To be added post-eval.


 ## C: Group Work & Projects

 ### Projects

 I worked on Rales Engine as well as Cloney Island as group projects.


 ### Rales Engine

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/rails-engine-api)

   * Queries: 4

 ##### Feedback to me:

 From Megan Talbot: "Alisher was such a supportive and helpful partner for Rales Engine!  He was always willing to try new things and very open to feedback. This was a hard project but I was very happy with our results. I unfortunately had a funeral on the last day of this project, but Alisher never missed a beat when offering to handle the eval on his own. He was very thoughtful in making sure I gained all of the  information that I could have missed, and I appreicate his eagerness to be there  for me in that way!


 ### Cloney Island

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/pushpin)
 * [Original Assignment](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

 We built an app called PushPin that replicates ThumbTack. This was definitely the biggest project I had participated in buidling.

 ##### Evaluation Scores:
   * Client expectations: 3
   * User experience: 3
   * Organization: 4
   * Git workflow: 4
   * Test quality: 3
   * Code Quality: 3
   * Did the team push themselves by taking risks: 1 - yes

 ##### Feedback to me:

 From Ali Schlereth: "This was the first project on which I worked with Alisher. He is a dedicated worker who puts in a lot of time and effort to get the job done. He is comfortable looking up resources and troubleshooting errors. We worked together on building out the internal API, most notably on building the post endpoint and testing it as well. I appreciated his calm and persistent nature. He was open to suggestions as well as providing his own. I would encourage Alisher to speak up and offer his opinions more in group situations as he has great ideas to share.  Also, he has great jokes : )"

 From Megan Talbot: "I loved the chance to work with Alisher again in Cloney Island! It was a very challenging project, but Alisher was again 100% committed and eager to help with anything. We worked on some of the same features on this project, such as Ratings, and I am confident that we both learned a lot. It was great to work him Alisher again and I appreciate his willingness to jump in on anything for these projects!''

 From Ryan Travitz: "Working with Alisher on Cloney Island was a great experience. Alisher is notable for his work ethic among a student body that does not lack for it. As part of a group that struggled to give critical feedback at times, I also appreciated that he pushed us to offer constructive comments in order to better each other. He contributed a great deal to our final product, and I am grateful that we had the chance to work together."


 ## D: Professional Development

 ### Professional Development Workshops
 #### Deliverables:

 * [Personal Project Proposal](https://gist.github.com/alishersadikov/93d47cc5f61f9065fa2e4da54c0f4333)
 * [Flower Exercise](https://gist.github.com/alishersadikov/99aa9d628d6d92effbe4200455123d8a)

 #### Networking Session
It was a great session and I had an opportunity to practice my personal story and skills to touch base with new people.

 #### Job Search Session
I am keeping reaching out to people and have actually found some pretty cool people, that I would be happy to have met and talked regardless of the outcome. Most of my contacts are in Kansas City and I actually managed to meet a few of them over the Christmas break.

 #### Job Interview Session
Very informative and eye-opening. As I keep learning about the tech interview process, I feel like I was not very fit before and getting better over time. I have had one mock interview with Ian Douglas and learned a lot from his feedback.

 ## E: Feedback and Community Participation

 ### Giving Feedback

 To Ali Schlereth:
 “This was the first time I officially collaborated on a project with Ali - on Cloney Island. To me, what stands out about Ali is her exceptional communication skills/manners: she is genuinely nice and supportive, no matter the circumstances.  Now add her clear thinking process and strong programming skills to this and you end up  with a very pleasant and productive collaboration experience with her.  I consider myself lucky to have been on one team with Ali and look forward to collaborating with her in the future!”

 To Megan Talbot:

 To Ryan Travitz:
 "Ryan was our project manager for Cloney Island project - PushPin, and he has done an excellent job of managing the project progress as well as making sure everybody is on the same page throughout the project. I really appreciated the way he attacks known and unknown problems that come up. Ryan is a hard worker and his backend programming and front end styling skills were crucial in getting this project complete."

 ### Being a Community Member

 I actively participated in Bezos possy and really enjoyed the activities and interactions with posse members. I also feel very close to my cohort - we have definitely bonded over the painful times within our projects!

 ### Playing a Part

 Although I have not paired with the lower module students as I had in module 2, I was curious what they were working on and tried to pair. Mostly, they were so into their projects that I found myself not really helpful or not really fast :).

 ### Gear Up

 #### Microaggressions
 This was a great gear up and everybody around me kept asking if I had experienced microagressions a lot. Definitely eye-opening in the sense that sometimes microagressions can get ridiculous as one of the articles illustrated.

 #### Journey Mapping
 This was an interesting session as we mapped our insurance claim journey with Daniel Shin. Might be a useful tool in organizing your plans and setting your expectations.

 #### Grit
 It was a good session and very informative.
