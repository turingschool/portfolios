# Alisher Sadikov - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this module can be summarized as diving into web development tools. Firstly, I want to become comfortable with Sinatra and be able to create a web application from scratch using Sinatra. Secondly, I want to learn Rails and get comfortable with it as well. Thirdly, I will learn just enough SQL to build web applications. Finally, the other concepts such as MVC and ActiveRecord are also on my radar.

On the non-programming side, I want to become a better communicator, collaborator and team player.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I worked on one graded project - Job Tracker and a few ungraded mini-projects, including IdeaBox and MixMaster

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

In this project, I was working with the existing code and modifying a personal job tracking app, to add CRUD functionality to different resources. I also created different tables in the database, utilizing migrations and one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

Scores:
- Database, Relationships, and Migrations: 4
- Routes: 3
- Controllers: 3
- ActiveRecord: 4
- Views: 3
- User Experience: 3
- Testing: 3


####  IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

In this project, I built an app to create and store ideas from scratch. In addition to learning about databases and routes, I experimented with testing a lot and created complicated(at that point for me) feature/integration tests such as a test for uploading an image from the local machine, building a factory for an admin user and logging the admin in etc.   

####  MixMaster

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

This app was built based on the tutorial which was very informative and demonstrated some good practices in building and testing this kind of apps. It was a good practice in the sense that some basic funtional pieces came together.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on two group projects: Rush Hour and Little Shop

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

RushHour is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. We will simulate the process of gathering and receiving data, which we will call a payload. The application accepts the submission of these payloads, analyzes the data submitted, and displays it through an HTML interface.

Scores:
- Functional Expectations: 3
- Test-Driven Development: 3
- Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
- Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
- View Layer: 3

From Anna Dolan: Alisher was one of my teammates on Rush Hour, and we worked together very successfully. He was helpful when I was lost early on in the project, and made sure that we didn't move on until I caught up. We spent long hours working as a group, and Alisher's pleasant and calm attitude contributed greatly to the group dynamic. Working with Alisher was absolutely a pleasure. I hope that we will get another chance to work together on a team.

From Erin Pintozzi: Erin was great in many aspects during the Rush Hour project. As a Project Manager, she took care of her project management tasks in an excellent manner.  We were always on the same page since everything was written out by her on our waffle cards which were being constantly updated. On the other hand, she worked hard on different components of the project and  did a great job solving some problems needed to complete the required functionality. I can recall a specific instance when I was supposed to work on something in the morning but she took care of it overnight and I got extra couple hours of sleep. So I look forward to working with Erin again.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bermannoah/check-please)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This is POS (Point-Of_Sale) application build on Ruby on Rails. It uses Bcrypt to encrypt authentication data. You can upload images using Paperclip and they are stored on AWS. Works with the Stripe and Unsplash APIs to both run credit cards and load background images. Testing with Capybara/RSpec and coverage provided by SimpleCov. External coverage by Code Climate.

## D: Professional Skills
I attended professional development workshops and gear up sessions which are described below.

### Gear Up

Sessions:
- Voting Your Conscience
- Introversion and Extroversion on Teams
- Resilience

##### Takeaways

All of the above gear up sessions were interesting. The first one refreshed my ideas about citizens' rights and responsibilities. The other gear up about introversion/extroversion was  valuable as well. The video by Susan Cain was very eye-opening and actually confirmed my belief that some people can reach their best workflow working in solitude. Finally, I absolutely loved the session on resilience and summarized some practices I would like to practice in the future:
  1. Do not accept the event as traumatic
  2. Even if you do, think that it could actually be worse
  3. Think that you would not have gotten this challenge if you did not have enough mental/emotional capacity to handle it.

### Professional Development Workshops
Participated in the following workshops:
  1. Finding Opportunities
  2. Collaborative Communication (BEE)
  3. Feedback II: Small Groups
  4. Cold Outreach

Polishing my resume and other professional profiles applying the feedback I had received. Started looking for jobs at good companies by keeping a company tracker spreadsheet. Making new connections every now and then.  

Deliverables:

#### Reflection on project management strategies and feedback:
Rush Hour and Little Shop were good projects to practice my project management strategies. In Rush Hour, I worked together with two nice ladies and for Little Shop I had 3 gentlemen on my team. Naturally, the dynamics were very different in both groups. It was no surprise that everybody had different work style and I practiced adapting to my teammates' style in order to produce a high quality product. Little Shop was also different in the sense that I no longer knew by heart the entire codebase, because of the divide and conquer strategy our group of four had to use, and of course, the size of the project. One important observation I made was that people had preference for who they would pair to tackle their user story for the reasons I knew and did not, whereas I made myself a rule to rotate and pair with everybody to improve my collaboration skills. In addition, I incorporated the feedback I had from Rush Hour teammates into my workflow during Little Shop. Finally we had excellent git workflow in both projects so they were a great practice in that regard as well. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Anna Dolan: I really enjoyed working with Anna on the Rush Hour Project. She is very quick at understanding what needs to be completed in a given situation to solve a certain problem.  I also noticed that she is great at not only building the logical pieces of the project, but also at visual things like styling. Throughout the project she had a very positive attitude which made the teamwork easy and enjoyable. I look forward to working with Anna again in the future.  

To Erin Pintozzi: Erin was great in many aspects during the Rush Hour project. As a Project Manager, she took care of her project management tasks in an excellent manner.  We were always on the same page since everything was written out by her on our waffle cards which were being constantly updated. On the other hand, she worked hard on different components of the project and  did a great job solving some problems needed to complete the required functionality. I can recall a specific instance when I was supposed to work on something in the morning but she took care of it overnight and I got extra couple hours of sleep. So I look forward to working with Erin again.

### Being a Community Member

This module I joined the Bezos posse and enjoyed working with the members of the posse on different challenges we were assigned. I am glad I could find a group of entrepreneurship oriented students to share my ideas with. I especially enjoyed the session "SEO Optimization" by Ian Lancaster.

### Playing a Part

I set up pairing sessions and paired with Mod 1 students over a dozen times throughout the module. In addition, I touched base with people who were struggling in Mod 1  and kept communicating with them to make sure they did not give up. Unfortunately, one of them is leaving the program anyway. Kept and on plastic fork supplis in the big workspace and made sure we have about a 1000 extra forks.
