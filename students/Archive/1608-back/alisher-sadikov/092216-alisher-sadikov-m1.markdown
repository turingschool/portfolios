## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module I worked on various projects, including Jungle Beat, Enigma, Event Reporter and Headcount.

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In a nutshell, my goal in this project was to make a very basic drum machine program, which involves one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List.

Evaluation notes from Jeff:
- 18 tests all pass
- Testing is good, write small tests rather than multiple assertions
- Implementation is good
- Extract small methods like predicate methods then reuse those small components/methods

Scores:

1. Functional Expectations: 4
2. Test-Driven Development: 4
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
5. Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

In this project, based on the same data file, I built an interactive query and reporting tool which fulfills the expectations. Re-used data cleaning procedures from the original EventManager to handle dirty input and generate beautiful output. I also explored creating our own HTML files and using an API.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I had two pair projects this module: Enigma and Headcount.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/enigma_pair_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This project is based on the actual Enigma machine that was used during the World War 2. It uses a five digit key and date to create four rotations which are then used to encode text. If not given, the key is generated randomly and the date is the date whenever the program is running. All characters are supported (88) except for single and double quotes.

Evaluation notes from Jeff:

- 37 tests all pass
- Tests are good and clear
- Look for opportunities to break out child objects when you see differing - levels of abstraction
- Like the testing of crack
- Implementation looks good
- Complexity is broken up well

Scores:

1. Overall Functionality: 4
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

This project uses data sets to ask and answer questions. We built upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation. The application was build to learn about education across the state of Colorado.

Starting with the CSV data have:

- built a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying - data
- built a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
- built an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions

Evaluation notes from Mark:

- Test Harness - iteration 0 through 5 passes with 0 failures and 0 errors
- Test Suite - 94 tests, 327 assertions, 99% coverage
- very consistent testing across repositories and models. easy to ready and understand
- great separation of responsibilities among private methods and modules

Scores:

1. Functional Expectations: 3
2. Test-Driven Development: 4
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
5. Enumerable & Collections: 3
6. Code Sanitation: 4

Eric: “Alisher was an amazing partner for Headcount. He took his time in explaining every detail of his thought process to me, taking considerable energy at moments when I didn’t fully understand how a component of the program was working. I learned a ton in the last two weeks of this module as a result of his guidance. He made me feel like there was never a challenge too big for us to take on. Anytime I had a concern about how we were approaching a problem he always took my point-of-view into account. He is one of the hardest working people I’ve encountered at Turing.”

## D: Professional Skills
I participated in Gear Up sessions and attended personal development classes with Lia.

### Gear Up
#### Communication Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/communication_styles.markdown)

Learned about different communication_styles. Concluded that people's communication styles should be taken into account when communicating with them. Also observed that not everybody's communication style is clear cut, but can a combination of two or more.

#### Gear Up - The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This session was eye-opening in the sense that it gave me insight into the issue of gender and how some women have been mistreated in the industry. I concluded that I should always pay attention to these issues and help out people who fall victims to them.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills#personal-branding-1)

Learned a few things about resumes, LinkedIn & Twitter accounts, and personal websites.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Eric: "I have really enjoyed working and collaborating with Eric, both within and outside the project we worked on. For our pair project Headcount, he was always on time and ready to put in the required amount of effort into a certain task we had to accomplish. In general, when I think of Eric the first thing that comes to my mind is how important it is to first formulate the right questions instead of trying to answer them. He has excellent communication skills and pretty good grasp of programming fundamentals, as well as classic and proven way of problem solving (such as white-boarding algorithms and brainstorming ideas etc.) He is a very hard-working student and I guarantee he will soon become one of the top students at Turing."

To Anthony: "Anthony is one of the most hard-working students in our cohort. It is absolutely amazing how many hours he puts into coding at Turing - he is usually the last person to leave. He just does not get tired of trying new ways and methods of solving a given problem, and can also see the problem from a completely different perspective and catches small details I usually miss. Anthony is a valuable asset to Turing community and will go far as a developer."

### Being a Community Member

From Anthony: "Alisher and I were never paired on a group project but we would often would come in on the weekends together to discuss our individual projects and how we planned on attacking them. Alisher is one of the most patient people to work with and truly cares about you understanding the concept he is explaining to you. He also has a fantastic grasp on the material and depth which helps him explain ideas really well. Once instance in particular he helped Eric and I on the Enigma project when I was not fully understanding the zip enum. He took time away from his project to help Eric and I push our further along. Alisher is an awesome person to have in our mod and in the Turing community as a whole."

From Vido: "I was kind of suprised when Alisher asked for some feedback.
I don't feel like I've worked enough with him to really speak one way or the other on his code.  I think repeating has done him well and really solidified concepts. From what I understand he's a G when it comes to testing which makes sense because he strikes me as being pretty process oriented.  This can be a strength or a weakness depending on the situation."


### Playing a Part

I wish I could have done better, but I did the following to support the general Turing community:
- Because I repeated, I tried to help out students in this cohort whenever I saw them struggling. Our skill difference was not huge so not much I could do in this regard.
- I found a place where I can buy cheap plastic forks sometime in the second half of this module. Brought a box of 1000 forks and keeping an eye on forks.
