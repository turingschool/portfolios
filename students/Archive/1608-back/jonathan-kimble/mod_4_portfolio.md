# Jon Kimble - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I wanted to end Turing on a strong note.  My primary technical goals where to reinforce what I learned over the first 3 modules as well as expand my knowledge of javascript and front-end development.  I also wanted to continue to expand my professional skills by co-running the Bezos posse and continue to take on extracurricular activities, such as giving lightening talks.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During this module our curriculum focused mainly on group projects.  However, We did have opportunities to polish our solo skills during in class assignments, during the mock and final assessments, and for our open source work.

#### Open Source

* [Blog URL](https://jon-kimble.com/2017/03/01/open-source/)
* [P.R. One](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1314)
* [P.R. Two](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1302/files)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/lessons/contributing_to_open_source)

Description: For this project we got to practice our open source workflow by finding projects and contributing to them.  We made two P.R.'s, contributed to documentation, confirmed a bug report, and summed up our progress in a blog post.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During this module we had a number of group projects which allowed us to practice working on development teams, building larger applications, as well as practice working on brown-field applications.  We were also challenged with juggling multiple projects at once and using a proper tracker workflow.

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbkimble/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Description: Quantified Self is an application which allows users to track the calories they have consumed and burned over time.  This application was an opportunity to practice client side storage and testing, as well as building an application entirely in javascript.

Evaluation Comments: nil

Evaluation Scores:

* Functionality: 3
* Testing: 2
* UI: 4
* JS: 3
* Git: 4
* Management: 4

Feedback To Me:

From Anna: I was lucky enough to work with Jon for the second time on Quantified Self. This was a very stressful project that definitely could have caused a lot of problems between some pairs, but thanks to Jon's calm and pleasant presence, we managed to get along well throughout the project. Jon also plowed through a lot of really tough code and did a great job. He did sometimes disappear and it would become really tough to communicate or to know where we were at on the project, but once we got on the same page, everything really came together. We won't work together at Turing again, but hopefully one day we will get a chance to in a different capacity!

#### MentorShip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/MentorSHIP)
* [Original Assignment Sprint 1](http://backend.turing.io/module4/sprint_1)
* [Original Assignment Sprint 2](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/secondary)

Description: MentorShip is an application which allows students to find and connect with potential mentors.  This project allowed us to practice taking on a brown-field application and making the code base our own.  We implemented react for the first time and practiced compiling and rendering data from multiple sources.

Evaluation Comments:
* Technical conversation happens on PR's in Github.
* Functionality conversations happen in Pivotal on the feature card.
* You guys have been doing a great job with Pivotal Tracker

Evaluation Scores:
* Project Management: 4
* Completion and Pace: 3
* Implementation Quality: 3

* Documentation: 3

Feedback To Me:

From Ben:
It was my first time work with Jon. I couldn't have asked for a better team member. He constantly beings enthusiasm and enjoyment into whatever he is doing. Jon constantly amazes me with his outgoing nature and that he always has a smile on his face. His drive to learn more each day is something I hope to emulate as I get into the industry.

Jon, You guys did a hell of a job getting React to work with MentorSHIP. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked with the app but the codebase we are leaving for 1610 is far better than we were handed. Thats part of brown field, can we leave this better then we found it? We did. Thats a lot and will only serve to set up 1610 for quick success. You did a lot to help that and they will have you to thank for it.

#### MashUp

* [Backend GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/mashup-api)
* [Frontend GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/mashup-frontend)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/secondary)

Description: Mashup is a project which allow Turing to create groups for a variety of purposes. It makes it easy to pick students in class, create lunch groups, and create custom groups from cohorts of your choice.

Evaluation Comments:
- Nice work with local storage
- Glad you're able to diagram the problem. Visuals are good for explaining technical challenges
- A little more instruction about how to use the app in the app would be nice
- Could have made the name a little bigger on popcicle view
- Glad you have a plan on where you would take this next
* Implemented the Popsicle name selector
* Implemented pairs
* Don't understand what the project bits are about
* Have generator for Lunch Roulette
* It'd be neat if the links were sharable (embed random generator seeds)
* Wish I could download the data into a csv or plaintext or something
* Challenge: scope of the project...?
* Didn't implement the ability to swap students
* Code Shame: lots of accidental refactoring / code simplification
* Proud: popsicle using localstorage
* Tracker: Got most stories delivered

Feedback To Me:

From Vido:
Jon I’ve worked with you on several projects at turing. Its always been a good experience. You have great interpersonal insights and are always very aware. I think these skills will take you far. Its cool to see how much better you’ve gotten since rush hour in early mod 2.  I really enjoyed the deeper conversation we had the other day about antagonism and the way people respond to communication. You have a lot of wisdom and a lot to teach. Thanks for being such a good teamate. To the point of quality code vs time i think in the future if you have a gut feeling about where something should live. Just ask. That way if others make the decision with you they are equally responsible. Again I enjoyed working with you and look forward to seeing what you accomplish.

From Megan:
Jon was a great partner for me this module. We worked together on many differnet things, and I was especially happy to have him in my group for the capstone project. It was a challenging project, but Jon is such a hard worker and never got discouraged when we hit obstacles. I really appreciate his positive attitude and level head.  I know Jon will have a super successful career and I look forward to seeing what he does!

## D: Professional Skills
During this module our professional skills focused on teaching us effective strategies for finding a job in tech.  We also had time to understand what our own career and life goals are and how to effectively make decisions to make them a reality.  Gear ups primarily focused on technologies role in society.

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy Of The Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Individual actions, even very small ones, build up across a society over time to have a very large effect on the nature of that society. Thus it is important to be mindful of ones actions and how they affect the world at large and be willing to change them if needed.

#### Automation and The Future

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Due to increasing automation it is likely that in the future there will be less work available. As a society, and members of the tech community, we need to decide how to address these issues constructively.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

U.B.I. might be an effective solution to the problems we may face in the future surrounding automation.  It is important to run experiments now to better understand how individuals and society would react to U.B.I..  Also, while it is still the early days, it is important to remain educated and aware of these issues and engage in productive discussions with others so they can be informed as well.


### Professional Development

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1608-b/jonathan_kimble.md)

Take aways:

With an effective process one can be much more successful in their job hunt.  By reaching out to others in tech it is possible to get help and support in ones job search as well as build a quality network.

### Giving Feedback

* Lee:
Lee it was awesome being at Turing School together, I'm super glad we got the chance to meet and work together.  Your natural curiosity, persitance, and attitude were HUGE assets to the mod for our whole 7 months here.  I truely think because of your keen ciritcal thinking skills, people skills, intelligence, and love of learning you'll accomplish anything you set your mind to.  I'm super excited to see what you get up to in the future.  You're going to be an incredibly strong dev/programmer and someone I imagine I'll learn alot from in the future. You got mad gumption!  From our first day meeting at the pre-turing event in the kitchen, to robo-pies, to wrapping up our final projects its been cool, thanks man!

* Megan:
It was great working together during mod4 and our whole time at Turing!  We collaborated on alot of stuff from S.A.B., to bezos, and finally on our projects during mod4.  Mod4 was a bit of a fight but you were the perfect partnener to face that challenge with.  I always appretiate your intelligence, insight, persistance, and calm resiliance in the face of every obstical we faced.  Your were a huge asset to the whole mod and my time and Turing and I hope we get to work together again in the future!

* Anna:
Anna it was great working with you on Quantified Self, I'm so glad we got the opportunity to work on two projects together before the end of Turing! You have always been a hard worker willing to take on any challenges and do what is best for the team.  No matter how much you have on your plate, whenever I've come to you with problems, you've been happy to pair for a bit to figure it out which I really appretiate! If there was one thing I think you could improve upon it would be stress managment, you seem to have things like running and climbing that work well for you outside of school but developing some ritual which can realiably defuse some of the stress at school might be helpful. Stress management techniques have helped me alot in the past and I would be happy to chat about it any time :).  It was great working with you and I know if we ever get assigned to a group again then code is about to be crushed!

* Vido: Vido it was cool working with during mod4. We hit a few struggles but we were always able to work through them and I really appretiate the positive supportive attitude you bring in times of stress and how you check in and support other members of the mod.  Your abillity to think through problems and spot potential problems and to come up with ideas and solutions are huge assets to any team you are apart of.  I think at times you could prioritize functionality over clean code when there is a time crunch, but it is definitly a balancing act.  Thanks for all the time together at Turing!

* Ben: Ben it was great getting a chance to work with you during mod4, you were a strong teammate willing to take on hard techinical challenges and manage a signifigant portion of project.  Even when things got tough you kept working and moving our teams forward.  Thanks for all the great experiences and staying strong in mod4, I hope we get the chance to work together again in the future!

* Ali: Ali was a huge asset to the Turing community and all our time at Turing. She is an incredibly hard worker with a level head who has always gone far out of her way to support her classmates.  She has both strong techincal and personal skills that make her an outstanding developer and teammate. In addition I think she has a strong moral compass which will lead her to meaningful and impactful work in the future, I'm really excited to see what she gets up to in the future and SO glad that she was a part of our mod.  Thanks Ali for always being awesome and supporting those around you!  Best of luck in the future and if you ever need anything feel free to reach out!

### Being a Community Member

Lee:

You’ve received positive feedback from me every module and this won’t be any different. Consistently you’re a positive voice that I rely on and although we didn’t get a chance to work together directly this mod I really appreciate our walks around the block and the almost weekly shakedowns. You’re obviously blessed with a high eq and have all the people skills in addition to your burgeoning technical skill-set. You also have great skills in receiving and applying feedback… I remember the difference in your workflow from robo-pies to now and you’ve obviously upped your game! I’m eager to see where we both end up and the things we end up doing. Thanks so much for all your insight! It’s been such a great ride!

### Playing a Part

During my time at Turing I have tried to support the community in as many ways possible.  I co-ran the Bezos posse this mod facilitating guest speakers, weekly lunch discussions, and spikes.  I gave a lightening talk to the school, was a member of Productivity Lunch, ran several job hunt sessions, and I also went out of my way to mentor younger students and help them understand how to be successful at Turing.

Deliver Session: I gave a lightening talk on how to be a more creative individual during wrap up.  I enjoyed communicating my thoughts on a topic I am passionate about, and addressing others false beliefs about themselves.  This is a topic I would like to give more speeches about in the future and I was glad to have the opportunity to give this talk. I also co-ran run 3 spikes for Bezos Posse and facilited lunch time discussions.

Pairing: I paired with two mod one groups on their projects.  I appretiated the time to help others as well as to re-exposed to the land of ruby.  It was a good time to review subjects I have learned as well as realize.  I also paired with 3 students in mods 1 & 2 during my job hunt sessions and passed on Alison's wisdom on what would be an effective way to start prepping for the job hunt early.

### Notes (From Nate)

- You started to let the stress get to you a little near the end, but on the whole, you kept a really great attitude this whole module. You were surrounded by some pretty negative forces, and managed to handle it. Good work.
- Your contributions to the community continue to have an impact. It helps that you chose to do things like Bezos and Productivity lunch, but you made real contributions in everything you chose to do.
- My critical feedback is learn to find balance. I think what I've seen from you is focus is a strong suit. When you set your mind to something, you tackle it, and tackle it hard. Being able to find the balance between many forces pulling you would be a great asset. Or simply acknowlege the weakness, and go deeper into focus :)

### Outcome

Recommended for Graduation
