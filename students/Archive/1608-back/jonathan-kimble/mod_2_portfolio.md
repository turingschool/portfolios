3. Feature Completeness: 4
4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style: 3
5. Rails Style: 3
6. Testing: 3

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had many individual and group projects this module. These projects gave us hands on experience building basic web applications, creating and storing information in databases, and improving our ability to work effectively on teams.  I enjoyed figuring out new aspects of rails and how one project built on the last. The progressive nature of these projects allowed us to solve ever harder problems and to have ever increasing functionality on our applications.

#### Job Tracker

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/job-tracker
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker

Description: Job Tracker was a solo project where we set out to build a simple application that would allow us to enter store jobs for a job search.  The jobs belonged to a company, had contacts, comments, and a category.  Through this process we practiced CRUDing out application, working with MVC, and building and querying information from databases. During this project I learned how to build a simple rails application by myself and troubleshoot and work through any problems that I faced.

Evaluation Notes: Test all the methods you have in your models, extract logic out of the controller, be sure to create associations when a new contact is created rather than later on, leverage active record methods as much as possible, extract queries out of the views into the controller, remember to test sad paths

Evaluation Scores:

1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations: 4
2. Routes: 3
3. Controllers: 3
4. ActiveRecord: 3
5. Views: 2
6. User Experience: 2
7. Testing: 2


#### Idea Box

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/idea_box
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown

Description: For our rails mini-project I chose to make an idea box to store and categorize ideas. For this project I wanted to cement my current knowledge of rails as well as explore greater functionality and more styling.  During this project I became more comfortable with bringing a concept from idea to implementation, even if I had little idea how to get their when I started.

What I learned / took away: How to troubleshoot effectively by questioning all my assumptions, breaking the problem down, starting in the most likely place for an error, and systematically eliminating possible problems.

#### Mix Master

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/mix_master
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master

Description: For mix master we built and application to organize and keep track of songs, artists and playlists.

What I learned / took away: I learned how to deploy and app to Heroku, how to test models and individual features, and expanded my knowledge of one-to-one relationships and many-to-many relationships.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 2 at Turing I worked on 2 group projects, during these projects I learned many valuable things from my classmates about how they approach and solved problems. I expanded my skills of communication and teamwork, developed my git workflow, and improved my project management capabilities.

#### Rush Hour

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/vidoseaver/rush-hour
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md

Description: For this project we worked as a team to build a web analytics tool similar in function to Google Analytics. We practiced inserting and pulling information from a database and using active record methods to manipulate the data. We had our first experience building a full app using the MVC pattern as well as got to improve our teamwork and communication skills.

Evaluation Comments: Pull logic out of the controller into a separate module which handles the logic, use local variables unless you are specifically passing information from the controller to the view.  Don't use multiple method calls in the view, extract them into single methods in the module.  Don't columns in the table named the same as the table itself.

Evaluation Scores:
1. Functional Expectations: 3
2. Test-Driven Development: 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
6. View Layer: 4


Feedback to me:
From Ryan: Jon exemplified grace through adversity during this project. He struggled at times with some of the material, but he remained engaged and found many ways to support our goals despite the academic challenges. I think he did an especially good job balancing the differing ideas that Vido and I had at times. I think the main area that Jon could improve on is in not falling too silent when he feels out of his comfort zone, even if it seems somehow like it is to the detriment of the group (it’s not really!) It was especially great to see Jon take charge in areas where he felt more comfortable with the subject matter. Jon’s commitment to clear communication about our group’s dynamic and overall working plan also contributed heavily to our overall success.

From Vido:
I think we all were on the same page throughout the project; we were able to communicate our concerns and thoughts, Jon you struggling with concepts and being able to admit that and ask for clarification take a certain bravery. You handled it extremely well also I appreciate your consideration for group. Like refactoring there are always things we can improve. While I think you did a great job of asking for help from as I said in the retro it would have been even more beneficial for you if you'd had that game changing conversation with Sal earlier. That said I enjoyed our group dynamics and ultimately we can chalk this one up as a win.

#### Little Shop

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/robo_pie
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown

Description: For Little Shop we set out to build an online store that satisfied our clients needs.  We practiced using TDD, the MVC pattern, generating one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, and using HTML and CSS to style our final project.

Evaluation Comments:

Feedback to me From Lee:
Jon, you’ve been a real treat to work with on little shop, I’m definitely grateful that the opportunity to work together came up. One thing you might continue to work on is ‘footwork’ , getting more comfortable with workflow and some of the small things that will speed up the transition between idea, and the code making it to the file. You continue to spark my interest in self-development and I appreciate the opportunity to brainstorm and get feedback/criticism/encouragement with/from you. Thanks for all the hard work and bulk of time on little shop!

## D: Professional Skills
Our professional skills this module focused mainly on building connections and a network within the tech community.  I found these session extremely valuable and had many take aways on how to approach individuals and companies I would like to be involved with and build long lasting meaningful relationships.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown

* Take aways / Reflection: During this gear-up I reinforced my determination and commitment to be an effective and active member our local, national, and global communities.  I reflected on what I look for in a political leader, the importance of open dialogue and how my own actions effect our political process.


#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

* Take aways / Reflection: I thought this was a great gear up that fostered an open sharing of thoughts and feelings within our cohort. My main take aways were how I can better serve those around me and make teams more effective by understanding others strengths and weaknesses and playing to these as we work towards a mutual goal. It was also eye opening to see how some of the people I had perceived as more extraverted saw themselves as leaning towards the introverted side of the spectrum and appreciated alone time.

#### Resilience

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown

* Take aways / Reflection: This was my favorite gear-up of the module.  My main takeaways from the articles and discussion were that one should always be striving to become more resilience by deliberately applying meaning to the events of our lives (seeing something as a 'growth opportunity' vs a 'traumatic event').  It is important to maintain an internal locus of control in all situations and focus on what can be done rather than how 'bad' any situation is.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding New Opportunities
* Workshop URL: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/finding_opportunities.md

* Link To Deliverables:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IPinlsKxGZFDwTYvs00nSggICwe7D5rbTszkNCJhFfc/edit?usp=sharing

* Takeaways From Session:
Take agency in getting a job at a great company by brainstorming companies and people you would like to work for and actively reaching out to these them. Creating an outstanding web presence for yourself can help significantly .  Reach out to hiring managers and build relationships within companies, find people at the companies you want to work for who have similar interests as you and reach out to them, build report, learn about the company and hopefully get help applying.  The key is just asking for help/advice/or whatever.

#### Collaborative Communication
* Workshop URL: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md

* Link To Deliverables:

* Takeaways From Session: There are many strategies one can employ to communicate more effectively in group situations.  It is important to have a high degree of empathy for your teammates as well as communicate openly and ask lots of questions.  You should meet your teammates where they are at and help all of you succeed by being an effective leader who involves all members of the team, sets expectations, and seeks to understand all perspectives.

#### Cold Outreach
* Workshop URL: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/tree/master/module_two

* Takeaways From Session: It is important to exercise cold outreach to build community and establish connections at companies which interest you.  Find someone with a common interest outside of tech and email them for coffee or to chat over google hangouts.  By keeping the email short, direct, and making it easy for them to say 'yes' you can build a worldwide community of fabulous individuals and companies.

#### Reflection on Project Management
##### What went well:
We had good intergroup communication, felt increasingly comfortable with all group members and were willing and able to have difficult discussions. Every one worked hard, motivated on another, set clear expectations and delivered.

##### What didn't go well:
We could have had a better process around using waffle to identify and keep track of issues. We could have a better work flow surrounding debugging problems (deliberately eliminating any and all assumptions) and we could have had a clear expectation on what success looked like for us.  Next time I think I will have more discussions around time boxing non critical features.

#### How have you incorporated feedback from your team members and what did you learn about yourself in the process?

I have become more aware of the need to communicate my thoughts and feelings in group work.  I have set out to deliberately seek out help whenever I feel confused or need greater understanding on a subject.  I have also worked to develop a specific set of questions I can ask to aid in debugging and working through challenges.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### Feedback For Ryan:
Ryan you were a great team member to work on a project with.  You were motivated, hard working, and supportive of our whole group.  I really appreciate how willing you were to answer all of my questions and take the time to make sure I understood concepts.  I would say the main thing you could improve on would be to speak up as soon as you start feeling frustrated or unsatisfied with how the project/group is going in any way. Calling a little retro right away or at the next pomodoro could really help cue the team into what you are thinking and ensure we can all perform our best together.  That aside I would be stoked to work on another project with you and am always grateful for you cool attitude and professionalism.

##### Feedback For Vido
Vido you were a great partner to have on a project.  When I was struggling with the concepts you repeatedly checked in to make sure I was understanding topics and helped me feel much more comfortable asking for help.  You also monitored group members closely and  communicated your thoughts and feelings in an effective way which addressed problems early on and kept the team on track.  While you were always quick to accept other points of view I think a way you could improve your team dynamic would be to express why you think your idea for execution was the best way to go, have a short discussion, and strive for coming to a consensus more quickly.  You were a great team member to have on a project and hopefully we get to work together again.

##### Feedback For Lee
Lee you were an ideal partner to have on a project, you were hard working and knowledgable on a wide range of subjects, and enjoyed working together even during the 12+ hour days.  Watching your work flow I learned a lot about how to approach problems, persist to find solutions, and admired your ambitions when it comes to implementing functions you've dreamed up.  If there was one thing I think you could improve upon it would be to focus on the function at hand and timebox when pursuing any potential features. I think these subtle tweaks to your workflow will lead to greater results and time to pursue additional features at the end of the project.  Thanks for being such a great partner, I had a blast working together and am looking forward to crushing more code together in the future!

### Being a Community Member

##### Feedback From Megan
Jon was an awesome partner for me this module. We were SAB reps together as well as working together with the Bezos posse. He was super willing to jump in and help with anything. He immediately offered to help with the clothing/food drive and the Glow in the Gardens event. He was always willing to step up to his SAB duties, as well as being an active member of Bezos. I will miss working with him on SAB next mod but know he will continue to do a great job!

### Playing a Part

I participated in S.A.B. this module and helped facilitate communication between staff and students, address students concerns and run weekly retros.  I helped run the Blake St. part of the food and clothing drive.

### Posse

#### What we did this module:
In Bezos posse we had a number of discussions surrounding how to solicit feedback from our users.  We also participated in a $5 challenge and had an after school meeting with the CEO and co-founder of Go Spot Check.

#### Favorite Experience:
My favorite experiences were the meeting Matt Talbot of Go Spot Check and working with my teammate Bekah on the $5 challenge.

#### How the posse has helped me grow as a professional:
It has given me greater confidence in my ability to succeed in any entrepreneurial endeavor, solicit valuable feedback from others, as well as improved my ability to communicate effectively in a group setting.
