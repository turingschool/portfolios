## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Jeff

Evaluation comments:
* Some troubles jumping to tools first and figuring out what you want second
* Understanding the boundaries of multiple objects is a bit fuzzy
* Process is getting better the more we work
* Enumerables vocabulary seems better than your comfort with what for what job

Evaluation Scores:

1. 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

2. 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

3. 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

4. 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

5. 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

6. 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My two individual projects.  These projects allowed me to apply basic ruby and O.O.P. to create functional programs.

#### Date Night
* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/date_night
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Description: In date night we worked with binary search trees and the ability to insert into a binary search tree, tell the depth of a specific node, and return the minimum node and the maximum node.  It was a challenging project that required us to learn about basic data structures.  During this project I learned about how to breakdown and tackle hard problems and apply recursion.  It greatly increased my confidence in my programming ability.

Evaluation comments:
* not full functionality, starting on sort method
* good separation of responsibilities
* consistent use of recursion across all methods, doesnt waffle back to looping

Evaluation Scores:

1. 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test

3. 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. 3.5: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter

* GitHub Link: https://github.com/jbkimble/event_reporter
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

Description: In event reported we worked with csv files and a REPL interface.  We learned about opening and writing files, searching through csv data, building methods, and outputting our results to various file types.

Evaluation comments:
* 12 tests
* Pull out CSV stuff
* overall good. Sweet use of emojis
* Dont have messages puts, have module return just the text and print on the outside to test
* District info is gotten but is not saved to the attendee objects, and therefore is not included in CSV or html export

Evaluation Scores:

1. 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

2. 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

3. 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

5. 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

6. 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

7. 3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are both of my group projects. These projects were an opportunity to work on my pairing and teamwork skills as well as expand my ability to solve problems with ruby.   I enjoyed working with a team and putting our heads together on a problem. I learned more about my own working style, areas of strength, writing clean ruby, and how to approach a problem in a way that leads to success.

#### Enigma

* Github URL: https://github.com/mscherer11/enigma-copy
* Assignment Link: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

Description: In this project we built a virtual enigma machine to encrypt, crack, and decrypt messages

Evaluation comments:
* test coverage is sparse
* separation of responsibilities is done well
* crack method was not complete
* did use 127 character alphabet using ascii map

Evaluation Scores:

1. 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

2. 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

4. 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


Feedback To Me:
* Jon was a great person to work with. He was very insightful in
not only how we should plan out our project but also in ways
that we could solve problems that we were working with. He was
very willing to put the time in to work on our projects and
get things done, both coming in on the weekend for extended
periods of time as well as staying late after class. He had a
positive attitude even when we would run into issues and that
made for a positive working environment.
Jon,

* It was awesome working with you on the Enigma project.  You had a lot of great insights and provided a major contribution overall.  You are thoughtful, insightful, and always willing to listen others; all of which were on display during the course of the project.  I was particularly impressed with the amount of thought that would go into anticipated logic overnight.  It was clear that you were organized, and cared about the success of the team.  You were a team-player throughout, but this was particularly on display at the end, when you agreed to take on the crack functionality alone.  I've noticed that you are always willing to contribute to the community as a whole in the same manner you contributed to our team.  Although minor and seemed to be a isolated issue (this would be feedback for the whole team), when you are feeling lost or misunderstanding, don't hesitate to speak up.  Overall, it was great working with you, and I hope we get to do it again in the future.

#### HeadCount

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/JStans12/headcount
* Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Description: In this project we create a program that allows us to load multiple csv files with data about colorado school districts and draw relationships between the data.

Evaluation Comments:  
* test harness - iteration 5, no failures, no errors
* test suite - 82 tests, 116 assertions, 0 errors, 0 failures - 100% coverage
* good unit testing and separation of responsbilities
* good use of modules and creation of helper methods along the way
* some long methods could be refactored
* "joey is a reduce ninja" -jon kimble

Evaluation Scores:

1. 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6

2. 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

6. 4: Zero complaints

Feedback To Me:
* Jon, it's been good working though hell count with you. It has gone really smoothly in terms of general DTR stuff and it's also nice that we are able to fill in the gaps in each other's code. If I'm forced to look for flaws, I think that coding stamina is an area where we could both improve. There were a couple days were we found ourselves completely braindead and decided to head out early. I think this will get better with time, and luckily, it wasn't an issue on this project.

## D: Professional Skills
At Turing there is an emphasis in developing professional skills as well as technical skills.  Professional skills help us find longterm success in the industry, be more effective, and give back to our communities.  They are an important part of the Turing curriculum.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

In order to learn rapidly there are several things to keep in mind: First don't try to learn every aspect of a new skill at once, instead break down problems into small chunks and master one tiny piece at a time before moving onto the next.  It is also vital to maintain growth mindset and a calm learning state of mind even in the face of difficult material, with repeated practice you can learn material that seemed impossible at first.  One way to accelerate your learning is to expose yourself repeatedly to lots of good examples of what you are trying to learn.  Finally, community is an important part of learning and in order to reach your full potential you must surround yourself with the best and learn from the best.
Lastly it is vital to be mindful of your limited cognitive reasources and apply them judiciously to achieve maximum results.

#### There Is An "I" In Team

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

In this session we learned about the importance of setting boundaries in a team project and how to respect the boundaries of your team mates.  In order to be the best teammate possible it is important to be compassionate and recognize the humanity of your teammates, everyone is doing their best and you should see things from their viewpoint and support them in whatever way is necessary to bring out their best selves.
During discussion we touched on several issues which lead to problems among teams: differing communication styles, work flow, and skill gaps between team members. To mitigate these challenges Completing a DTR is super important, also set yourself up for open communication, have regular checkins, and address any problems in a respectful way as soon as your notice them.

#### Debugging The GenderGap

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

Takeaways from the session:

In this session we learned about diversity issues within tech and what we can do throughout or careers to cultivate a diverse and inclusive culture. There are far fewer women in the tech industry than men and this unbalance takes away from teams and the products they create. Because the industry is primarily male it can lead to institutionalized sexism and further push women and minorities away from the industry compounding the problem. To improve the situation we can be mindful of others and how to make them feel comfortable and included in a space.  We can take personal-responsibility/agency in creating an inclusive and diverse tech community by letting everyone know that tech is for them and they can succeed here, and by putting systems in place to actively increase diversity in our communities.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback For Eric:
* Eric, it has been great being in mod 1 with you! It is inspiring to see your positive attitude, growth mindset, and longterm approaching when it comes to coding. You hold yourself to a high standard and seek opportunities to learn more and expand your knowledge and this lifts up the whole mod. I am consistently impressed by the questions you ask in class and the armstrong posse; they spark all of our curiosity and help us learn more. You engage with others in a meaningful way, work hard while maintaining the groups moral, and are a strong asset to any team.  If I have any actionable feedback for you it would be to ask more questions in class because we all benefit from them!

###### Feedback For Mike:
* Mike you were a fantastic teammate to have on a project, I'm really glad we got to work on a project together in module 1.  During Enigma you displayed a great attitude, worked hard, and naturally migrated to a leadership role in our group, which I think fits you well. You were aware of your teammates and concerned about their wellbeing and at the same time were consistently producing quality code.  If there was one piece of constructive feedback I would give it would be that sometimes it's good to slow down and take a step back from the project, perhaps especially when it feels like you need to rush. I look forward to working together more in the future and you definitely add a lot to the turing community.

###### Feedback For Ryan:
* Ryan has been a huge help to me during my time at Turing, he has always made himself available to answer any questions I or my teammates may have.  He has a calm and conversational way of explaining concepts that leaves me walking away with understanding what is going on rather than just with an answer. He also shows great dedication to all of his work at Turing and this serves as a continued inspiration.  It is very motivating to see his focus, the high standard of performance he holds himself to, and the quality of work he produces. Ryan is a great guy to be around and adds to all of our experience at Turing in numerous ways.

###### Feedback For Lee:
* What up Lee! It has been awesome being in mod 1 with you. Seeing how hard you work has consistently pushes me to put in the extra hours and go all in on Turing. I've seen huge growth in your coding skills and am confident that you would be a vital member of any team project.  You actively engage in every class and come up with awesome metaphors that help me understand the material!  Your positive attitude towards new coding concepts and your curiosity are real assets to the whole mod.  You have also worked hard to build a community at Turing and I know all of us really appreciate it! If there was one thing you could improve on it would probably be to stress less about the project and just be as focused as possible on implementation.  From my perspective you are killing it, keep up the good work in next mod.

###### Feedback For Jason:
* Jason you were a great teammate to have on a project.  You worked hard on Enigma and were willing to spend long hours at Turing and maintain a positive attitude, even when it was late and you still had a long train ride home. This positive attitude and your attention to detail were huge assets.  If there was one piece of feedback I would give it would be to ask questions if you don’t understand a piece of code. Besides that you were a great teammate. I appreciate your longterm mindset when in comes to coding and would be happy to work on another project with you!

###### Feedback For Joey:
* Joey you have been a great partner on headcount. You have an effective and inclusive work style that makes you a strong asset to any team. I learned a ton while working with, you were always available to answer my questions and guide me through aspects that I didn't fully understand. I think your skills in coding and communication rightfully lead many of the other students in our mod come to your for help and advice. It is inspiring to see you constantly hold yourself to a high standard and how quickly you pick up little ruby tricks and implement them in your own code.  If there was one area you could pinpoint for improvement it would be practicing breaking problems down and writing pseudo code, they may come in handy in the future when facing more difficult problems.  Great work on headcount, I look forward to working together again.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback to me:
##### Feedback From Ryan
* Jon is a personal inspiration to me at Turing because of the way that he carries himself and interacts with others. I am particularly impressed by his ability to tackle things that I find daunting such as interacting with existing members of the tech community. By the end of this module, Jon will have already been to multiple events in the area and started tentatively looking at the job market. I have no doubt that he will excel in this area because of his natural ability to authentically engage with any individual’s interests. I think everyone at Turing could learn something from his example.

##### Feedback From Lee
* Jon, I've pretty much only got positive feed-back for you. I really appreciate
how open you are to helping others. It's not only that willingness but
that what you are offering for advice is grounded in some serious self-study.
What you are saying thus has more weight because you've studied the thing and read
some books and have tried applying what they espouse in your own life. This was first
exhibited when you sent me a large snippet entailing how one might go about rewiring
their likes and dislikes. Another occasion you provided some background on types
of meditation, in full pdf form! I really appreciate the laughs and support!

##### Feedback From Eric
* Jon, you are team Zen in 1608. I always hear you laughing which lightens my spirits on hard days — oh, wait that’s everyday. You offered me excellent techniques in managing stress, I’m grateful for it.

### Playing a Part

##### Ways you supported the larger Turing community:
During my first module at Turing I have supported the community in a number of ways.  I have been an active in the Bezos posse and Productivity Lunch groups trying to engage as much as possible and contribute to discussions.  I have taken an active role in checking in with members of my cohort and ensuring they are feeling positive about the Turing experience and not overwhelmed. I have tried to create an atmosphere of positivity and growth that encourages us all to stay motivated and work hard together.  When asked, I have helped introduce several members of the cohort to stress relief techniques.  I also have represented Turing at several Meetups including exchanging a number of emails with a prospective Turing student, answer his questions about the Turing process, and encouraging him to apply.
