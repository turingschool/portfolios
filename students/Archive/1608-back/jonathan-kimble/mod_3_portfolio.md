#### API Curious

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/github_api_shell
* Original Assignment: http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious

Description: Hit an external API and use styling to rebuild your own version of a website

What I learned / took away: How to style more effectivily.  How to hit an external API, use methods to control the data, and render to a view in a human readable way.

#### Self Directed Project

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/jbkimble/project_andra
* Original Assignment: http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project
* Link to original Pitch: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lM87z2NrR1SDq2XUECRTJRHsfv-rZfvPsf356PPQCtk/edit?usp=sharing

Description: Build your own successful web application from idea to execution.  Practice all the skills you have learned so for at turing with a particular focus on expansion into javascript and leveraging API's to solve people problems.

What I learned / took away: I learned how to manage a project from start to finish.  I learned how to find the information necessary to implement the features I dream up.  I learned how to javascript.

Evaluation Notes:
-  Lots of new challenges, made it work for each
- Has tasks to continue working on, but it is in good, presentable state right now
- Materialize switch from Bootstrap - messed up styles on production but functionality is still there
- Emotion API, Materialize, MorrisJS charts
- Page load with assets is slow, client-side asset caching would be worth looking into

Evaluation Scores:

1. Completion: 3
2. Organization: 3
3. Testing: 3
4. Code Quality: 3
5. User Experience: 3
5. Performance: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Module 3 at Turing we had the opportunity to work on a number of group projects.  In the third module the scope and complexity of the projects increased and this gave us further opportunities to improve our ability to breakdown projects into pieces and complete them individually as well as the communication best practices that come into play when writing code.

#### Rales Engine

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/NZenitram/rails_engine
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1608-b/3module/rails_engine/jon_nick.md

Description: Rails engine was a group project where we created our own API with end points which yield business intelligence.  We also had the opportunity to practice advance active record queries.

Evaluation Notes:
- README should include db setup instructions.
- Code is pushed through layers of Rails really well.
- Routes have room to refactor out hardcoded dynamic segments (:id)
- Code coverage is high, but some core layers could be more thoroughly tested / code that isn't used could be removed
- Boss level challenge not implemented
- Merchant unit level specs would be nice

Evaluation Scores:

1. Completion: 3
2. Code Quality: 3
3. API Design: 4
4. Queries: 4
5. Testing: 4

Feedback to me From Nick: Working with you on rails_engine was a pleasure. You are understanding disposition makes you easy to work with. Your ability to adapt to the personality of the person you are working side by side with will be invaluable in the work place and throughout your career. We were setting new industry standards every step of the way! Outside of that project, you are in general, a very genuine and modest man. You set the bar very high in the way you communicate with and represent our cohort. You are a model student and representative of the Turing community. I can only hope to have the opportunity to work with you again.

#### Cloney-Island

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/epintozzi/pinspiration
* Original Assignment: http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island

Description: Use rails to clone the web application 'Pinterest' we worked on ability to divide up work and build a functional larger application.

Evaluation Scores:

1. Client Expectations: 3
2. User Experience: 3
3. Organization: 4
4. Git Workflow: 4
5. Testing: 4
6. Code Quality: 3
7. Bonus: 0

Feedback to me From Anna:
Pinspiration was my first project with Jon, and it was a great experience working with him. Jon has a great attitude and kept everyone smiling through a very difficult project. He is also an incredibly hard worker and worked through some very difficult logic on his own. Jon was incredible to work with, and I hope I will get a chance to work with him again.

Feedback to me From Erin:
Jon is a great group partner. He is so easy going and determined. Jon took on some very challenging tasks which he saw through to completion. Jon has a great gauge for knowing when to ask for help and when to keep digging. He also is very even-keeled which proved to be very helpful when our group hit a point of tension. I learned a lot working with Jon and I think our project was much better for it.

## D: Professional Development

Our professional skills this module focused on the job search and continuing to build relationships in the industry and to get us ready for interviews.

* Take aways / Reflection: Having a grit mindset is critical, but it is PASSION mixed with perseverance which creates true grit.  Stopping sometimes is good, grit is not continuing on when it is better to take a break.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### Feedback For Anna:
It was great working with Anna on cloney island.  She showed a strong work ethic and technical skills and was a driving force in the completion of our project.  In addition to her technical skills Anna was an all around joy to work with on the project.  Even when things got hard she didn't let the stress effect her overall attitude!  She is also always willing to help and has a unique ability to make people feel comfortable about approaching her for a help and coming to a solution!

##### Feedback For Erin:
Erin was a fantastic person to work on S.A.B. and for our cloney island group project.  Erins strong organization skills were invaluable and really sped up our whole work flow.  In addition to these organizational skills Erin's ability to work with others and handle issues that arize is outstanding and a huge asset.  It was great working with Erin this mod and I look forward to the opportunity to work together again!

##### Feedback For Nick:
Nick you were a great partener to have on rales engine.  You showed up early, worked hard, and kept a consitently positive attitude as we worked our way through difficult problems.  I think the one area where where you shine the most is your empathy for others. You are clearly aware of others thoughts and feelings, and go out of your way to check in on others and make sure they are doing well.  This is a great trait to have as both a team mate and a human being! If I had to give one piece of advice it would be to slow down, espetially in the beginning, and evalute what to skim-over/time-box and what to spend a little more time on.  I think if we had spent a little more time in the beggining understanding test set up and some active record basics it would have accelerated our progress overall.  It was great working with you and I hope we have a chance to work together again in the future!

### Being a Community Member

##### Feedback From Mike
Jon is an incredibly passionate and caring person. I have a hard time imagining anyone not feeling welcomed and fundamentally seen by Jon. He has an uncanny knack for getting excited about any and all things, and this enthusiasm is noticeably contagious in a group setting. I see Jon as a deeply humble and motivated person, which I consider to be essential ingredients for success. I’m better for knowing him, and take great comfort in the fact that everyone who meets Jon will be inspired to live with authenticity and curiosity.

### Posse

#### Take aways this module:
My main take aways from Bezos this mod are the friendships and community I have built in the posse.  It is great to interact with similar minded individuals on a regular basis.  I have also become much more aware of users needs when it comes to software and how to understand and fulfill those needs.
