# Nicholas Martinez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one I set out the learn Ruby. The progress I have made throughout the module is fantastic. I realized throughout the mod that computer programming is much more creative than I thought it was coming into Turing. I have really had to work on adjusting the way I approach problems and think about the projects. I am focusing on TDD throughout the Headcount projects rather than diving head first into code. The number one critique of my work has been about refining the process of my work.

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This modules individual projects focused on data structures and enumeration. These projects required that we think about how to access and pull data from provided data sets. My focus was on organization and maintaining single responsibilities within classes and methods.

#### Date-night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/datenight)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

The goal of the project was to build a binary search tree using ruby.

1. Functional Expectations  
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development  
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion  
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

In Event Reporter I learned how to build a relational database with data from CSV tables.

1. Functional Expectations  
3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. REPL Interface  
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

3. Test-Driven Development  
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. Breaking Logic into Components  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

5. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

6. Enumerable & Collections  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

7. HTML and Style  
3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were similar to the individual projects for the module, but larger in scope. The Enigma project focused on logic while the Headcount project had us build a relational database from more than one dozen CSV files with tens of thousands of lines of data.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In Enigma we built an encrypting and decrypting program that mirrors Alan Turing's Enigma machine built during WWII.

Notes:

28 tests all pass, one skip
Tests are overall good growth, don't quite feel fluent/full, but good progress
implementation is pretty good
some over-use of instance variables
a little bit of leaky abstraction when encapsulating functionality
watch out for "code smells" that show you weakness


1. Overall Functionality  
3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development  
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components  
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

Robbie Smith -

"Nick and I worked on Enigma together, while the project was successful we struggle with some communication issues throughout the project. I am glad that I was partnered with Nick during this process. After the project, Nick and I were able to maturely discuss our shortcomings and not only was Nick able to give constructive feedback, he was also able to receive my feedback. And this maturity is valuable in growing and becoming a better team member in the future. The feedback he gave me, has also helped me in the current paired project to be more aware of my communication shortcomings."

### Headcount


David Junta -

"Nick was my partner for the Headcount project.  He had a great attitude throughout a very tough project.  One of his biggest strengths is the ability to keep trying new approaches when obstacles appeared.  Even in those times, he was always able to keep things light and fun while working diligently and collaboratively to power through and find a solution."

## D: Professional Skills



### Gear Up
#### (Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I felt the most valuable part of the session was listening to the people in the discussion portion of the Gear-Up discuss how they have been singled out or discriminated against in the work place. A real-world perspective  on how non-overt discrimination occurs was very important to hear about and discuss.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

Making efficient use of limited cognitive resources is very important to maintaining an effective and productive working schedule. I was surprised to learn that there is a very real limit on the amount of cognitive resources available to one on any given day.  


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning How to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)

Defining the relationship is vitally important for any project. It sets the tone and expectations for each person in the group and provides concrete details and a schedule for each person to follow. It allows the group to hold individuals accountable to the expectations outline in the DTR.

#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

During the personal branding workshops we were exposed to different strategies and methods we will need to use to brand ourselves to the information technology industry. We were introduced to different techniques and social media platforms we can use to gain exposure and connect with people and businesses across the country in IT.



## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Robbie Smith -

"Robbie and I were paired up for the Enigma project in module one and even as we struggled to communicate effectively throughout, we managed to complete it. During the retro, Robbie was open and honest in discussing the issues he believed led to the communication breakdown. It was enlightening to hear exactly what I need to improve on in the future to be a better working pair and professional. I admire Robbie's work ethic and ability to stay focused on problems until they are complete."

To David Junta -

"David is an excellent work partner and provides consistent feed back. Our work together was productive and efficient. David is great at bouncing ideas around and working toward a common goal. David is a great communicator and very professional. He managed the stress of a very difficult project well and was a blast to work with. I would enjoy working with David on projects in the future."


### Being a Community Member

From Robbie Smith -

Nick and I worked on Enigma together, while the project was successful we struggle with some communication issues throughout the project. I am glad that I was partnered with Nick during this process. After the project, Nick and I were able to maturely discuss our shortcomings and not only was Nick able to give constructive feedback, he was also able to receive my feedback. And this maturity is valuable in growing and becoming a better team member in the future. The feedback he gave me, has also helped me in the current paired project to be more aware of my communication shortcomings.

From David Junta - 

Nick was my partner for the Headcount project.  He had a great attitude throughout a very tough project.  One of his biggest strengths is the ability to keep trying new approaches when obstacles appeared.  Even in those times, he was always able to keep things light and fun while working diligently and collaboratively to power through and find a solution.

### Playing a Part

I am looking forward to participating more in community events in the future. During Module 1, I did participate in Friday spikes and some lunch events, but I never settled on a specific posse or group.
