# Nicholas Martinez - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Module 2 I have successfully learned how to CRUD out active record and PSQL rails using Sinatra and Rails. I have learned how to authenticate users and visitors to my websites as well as authorize administrator access, privileges, and functionality to segregated parts of the websites. I also spent some time learning how to deploy web applications using Amazon's Web Services platform and will spend some time over the intermission deploying the web app we developed to AWS's servers.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 2
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

 * 3: Developer is able to implement all functionality and all tests pass

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

 * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 * 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

Built a web app to log and categorize jobs between companies. The jobs carry tags, contact information, comments and level of interest ratings to help sort and search through the listings.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

  In the segment below you will find the group projects I worked on throughout the module as well as the scores and comments left by my teammates. Scores are evaluated as a group and presented as the project is graded.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. Rush Hour will simulate this process and accepts the submission of these payloads, analyzes the data submitted and displays if through a HTML interface.


Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills base expectations

Test-Driven Development
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

View Layer
  4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

Workflow (NOT GRADED)

  3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

- Ali Schlereth
Nick, I really enjoyed working with you on this project. I appreciated your patience and collaboration across working styles. You collaborated well, both giving and receiving suggestions. You were great about working through problems; however, you may have been able to achieve further stamina with more regular work breaks.

- Michael Scherer

Nick was a great teammate.  He was willing hold discussions, ask questions, and communicated well.  Personally, I like direct communication, and Nick did not hold back when sharing his views.  He did a solid job as project manager, often facilitating discussions.  He was flexible with timing, and even tried to tough out food-poisoning to help finish the project.  One opportunity for Nick is to know when to slow down; there are times when he moves to quickly and makes oversights when he writes code.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Civics lessons should teach students about the real cost of their virtue. Every time one suggests "society should" do a thing, there is a very real cost associated with that thing. While those costs may not be tangible or experienced by the person making the suggestion, it will, inevitably, cost someone something. The disconnect from these real costs and the perceived results is why the expansion of the Federal power and government at large has proliferated over the last century. Corporate interests and government have the desire to hide this expansion as "protection" and "in the general good of the public" when typically the oligarch is simply enriching themselves at the expense of others. They carve out exceptions to the very rules and regulations they propose to erect barriers of entry into markets to protect their own interests at the expense of the people. The people, enamored with this idea of being virtuous blindly support policies that make themselves less free to pursue their own vocations and build their own lives. The people complain about corporate interests having too much influence over our government, but they blame the money and the corporations for this influence, not the the people that took an oath to protect the Constitution and represent their electorate. The people believe that supporting virtue through the use a coercive force (i.e. government force) is being actionable and takes effort. It isn't and it doesn't.

#### Introvert and Extrovert

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I believe the introvert/extrovert structure is a false dichotomy. It is very easy for an extrovert to get into their own head about things that we associate extroverted personalities with. I also believe it is possible for an introvert to express themselves in ways that we typically associate with extroverts. I take issue with the idea that there are these "two kinds of people" in this world as I believe that people are degrees of either spectrum.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication

I felt that as the project manager on Rush Hour, I could have done more to lead the team. I didn't feel like the strongest team member which led me to shy away from leading. I should have spent more time utilizing the Waffle cards to organize what we were working on. My team mentioned as much during out post project retro and I agreed with them. The only caveat to the criticism I would have is that, as a team, we worked side by side for the duration of the project so organizing the process remotely didn't feel all that necessary. With that said, the communication out team kept up with was great and tackled each task together. We listened to each other when concerns were voiced and the overall chemistry was excellent. I have taken a lot away from the feedback in Module 1 and I have put into practice. The critical feedback I have received throughout Turing has made me more self aware about how I approach team work and the individuals within my team.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- Ali Schlereth -

Ali was a great teammate and excellent communicator. She is open with feedback and provides effective and accurate critical evaluation of both the project and her teammates. Disagreeing with Ali on certain aspects of the project was a pleasure. She was easy to talk to and always constructive. The best feedback I could give Ali would be to be aware of the time spent on what may be trivial issues in regard to the scope of the project. It was a pleasure working with Ali throughout the project and I would recommend her as a teammate to anyone.

- Michael Scherer

Mike is an excellent teammate and great partner. He was easy to get along with and a good communicator. His habit of repeating questions back to the person who asks them is reassuring and something I hope to learn from. Mike is a natural leader and his thought process when approaching problems is commendable. I do believe that Mike's communication style, much like my own, could be taken poorly by some people and it is always worth being aware of. It was a pleasure working with Mike throughout the project and it would be a pleasure working with him again.
