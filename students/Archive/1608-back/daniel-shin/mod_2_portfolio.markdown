# Daniel Shin - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, I would like to spend most of my focus on having an in-depth understanding of web applications, such as the HTTP response cycle and MVC models. Furthermore, I would like to expand my understanding beyond what Turing teaches. Obviously I would like to become comfortable with the Rails framework, but I think it is more important to me that I can take what I learn from Rails and apply it to another framework, such as Django and ASP.NET.

## Rubric Scores

**A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5  
I thought I did well on the mid-mod and the final, but I had a hiccup on one part in the final which I think prevented me from getting more 4's. I understand the score doesn't matter that much, but it's a personal thing.  

**B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4  
I thought I did very well on all my individual work. I would take the time to do the extensions as well as style as much as I could.

**C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5  
I thought I did well on Rush Hour and invested much of my time in the project and the group. I would say I was not as invested in the Little Shop project, but I tried to make sure the project would still do well.

**D: Professional Skills**: 3  
I did all the things that Lia asked me to do, but I did not go above and beyond with the professional skill tasks

**E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3   
I helped out Mod 1 students a few times, and I always try to get our cohort to hang out outside of class

3.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

**Testing**  :  
3.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

**Collaboration** :  
3.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects consisted of Robot World, Task Manager, tutorials such as (Blogger, Mix Master) and Job Tracker

### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/robot-world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud_redux.markdown)

#### Description
This project introduced me to basic CRUD functionality. I took this opportunity to do more CSS than expected.

### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

#### Description
This project introduced us to doing routes for a Rails project. I learned about Paperclip, encrypted passwords and using forms.

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/mix-master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

#### Description
This project was an additional CRUD Rails program using more complicated routes and ActiveRecord using many-to-many relationships.

### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

#### Description
This project was a CRUD Rails program using custom routes, ActiveRecord, and several different models. I used this opportunity to fully understand MVC patterns, ActiveRecord queries, and more technical CSS tricks.

#### Evaluation Scores

**Database, Relationships, and Migrations**  
4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

**Routes**  
4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

**Controllers**  
4: The developer has moved logic out of the controllers and into the models/POROs where appropriate. The developer uses strong params in a private method. Instance variables being passed to views are appropriately named and limited in number. The developer can speak to each choice made when questioned.

**ActiveRecord**  
4: ActiveRecord methods are used in models to supply all appropriate functionality. Methods exist on the appropriate model, and developers are not referencing other classes or self in models unnecessarily. Ruby enumerables are not used where ActiveRecord methods could provide the necessary functionality. The developer can explain the ActiveRecord methods they used and the relationships between ActiveRecord models.

**Views**  
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

**User Experience**  
4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

**Testing**  
4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
The group projects I worked on included Rush Hour and Little Shop. Rush Hour gave me a better understanding of the Request Response cycle, and Little Shop was another CRUD project.

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

##### Description
This project was a multi-model program that took JSON formatted data as requests and sent responses.

#### Evaluation Comments


#### Evaluation Scores

**Functional Expectations**  
3: Application fulfills base expectations

**Test-Driven Development**  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

**Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components**  
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

**Fundamental Ruby & Style**  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

**Sinatra / Web and Business Logic**  
3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

**View Layer**  
3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

**Workflow (NOT GRADED)**  

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Feedback to me
From Anthony: Positive--learned a lot about databases and difficult logic. Fun. It was cool. Good group dynamics. Constructive--gives off nervous energy, even when it's just excitement.

From Brad: Positive--Appreciated when Daniel answers questions when confused. Constructive--You get fixated on a single solution and prevents us from exploring other solutions

### Little Shop  

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bermannoah/check-please)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

##### Description
This was another CRUD project.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)  

This Gear Up was incentivizing us to vote as a responsibility. I understood the purpose behind it, as it was indicating that we do have a choice to to affect our government. I thought the framing of the information was clearly skewed. As someone who is not liberal or conservative, it seemed like the material was clearly pushing Democratic ideals. However, I do understand that I should vote.

#### Introvert Extrovert

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)  

This gear up was about how introverts and extroverts should work together and understand each other's strengths. People are typically not black and white about being extroverted or introverted, but I believe people do align themselves typically with one or the other more frequently. I thought this was pretty relevant to working in groups at Turing as some of us may come off as introvert whereas some of us may come off as being more extroverted.


#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up was about developing resilience to difficult situations. I thought this was pertinent to the software industry since as developers, many things can go wrong and fingers can be pointed. It is important to stay focused when it appears that nothing is going right, as this will not only help you find a solution, but also show others how patience can guide you to the right answer.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)

#### Personal Branding Pt 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

#### Cold Emailing

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

I found my Rush Hour project to be very successful considering the dynamic of my group. The most prominent strategy would have to be being very inclusive of everyone in my group, even when the solution has been found. The best examples are when we as a group come to a solution, but one of us did not understand the solution yet. I found that asking the group if they understood what was going on really made them feel more included and on the same page as everyone else.
