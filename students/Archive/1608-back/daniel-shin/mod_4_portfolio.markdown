# Daniel Shin - M4 Portfolio

## Overview
My goal coming into this module was to have a solid understanding of JavaScript and one or two related technologies, such as NodeJS or React. Luckily the capstone project gave my group and me room to experiment, and I think it turned out very well.

Although my mindset was focused on JS and the client-side, during the mod I realized how much other neat stuff the back-end has that in the end will probably make me a better "computer science" programmer.


## Self Assessment

**End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

I successfully used message queues, implemented decently clean and readable JavaScript, and had a pretty clean UI. Overall I thought the end product was pretty good, except I definitely didn't do as well in testing.

I probably wasted a ton of time considering I spent the full 14 hours. I would say the worst part of the experience was that I started to realize I was wasting time and began to stress myself out. I need to learn how to calm myself down during situations where I know I made a lengthy mistake.

**Individual Work & Projects**: 3

I enjoyed doing the open source project. Even though it picked a while to pick the proper project, going into the code and seeing advanced ruby was enjoyable.

**Group Work & Projects**: 4  

I gave the capstone project all the energy I could give. I was pretty motivated to learn React, and luckily my group was on board as well. We spent long hours almost every day, and implemented quality server side and client side code.

I also think that the group dynamics worked out very well. There was a moment during the project where the group felt lost and unmotivated, and I made it a point to clean up logic / get functionality working with the group so that everyone would feel like they're back on track.

**Professional Skills**: 3  

I did all that was asked for, but I think I fall in the category of people who are anxious but do not act on the anxiety when it comes to getting a job.

**Feedback & Community Participation**: 3  

I paired with a few Mod 1 students, and participated in the Turing Lab posse every time they got together.

## Included Projects

The graded projects consisted of Quantified Self and Briefcase

### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

#### Description
This was our first pure JavaScript project. I would say this, along with Event Reporter, have been my favorite projects at Turing. I think one of the reasons is because I felt like an actual developer, where I would write code and see it do something in front of my eyes.

I made it a point to write object oriented JavaScript, using classes and shared functions across different files. One of my favorite refactoring moments was taking a function and make it reusable for any event listener.

#### Assessment
Graded by: Jeff   

Notes:
* Tracker indicates all expected features are delivered
* user experience is pretty solid
* Day navigation and persistence works
* Log stays accurate with changes, edits, deletions
* Testing looks really good
* Look out for little things like target/verify based on CSS classes * rather than specific values
* Experiment with dynamic ID generation in your view rendering to allow for targeting on identity rather than hierarchy (nth-child)
* JavaScript implementation style is beautiful
* Good job isolating the ugly/unpleasant parts and keeping them away from the good stuff

#### Functional Expectations:  3  
Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

#### Testing:  4  
All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests

#### HTML/CSS/UI:  3  
Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

#### JS syntax and Style:  4  
Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

#### Git Workflow:  4  
Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

#### Project Management:  4  
Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

### Briefcase

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/briefcase)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

#### Description
This was a Rails project with a React front end that recreated the Turing alumni page. It was my first introduction to React, which I learned did not work with Rails too well considering Rails has built-in ERB. Overall, I thought the final product turned out pretty well.

The hardest part was definitely understanding state management and sending data back up the parents to make the final Ajax calls. Learning React was definitely a great learning experience, and I hope to learn more client-side tools in the future. One of the coolest refactoring sessions was converting "New" and "Edit" components as a single component that can be used by both routes.

#### Assessment
Graded By: Nate  

Notes:

#### Project Management: 3  
Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.

#### Completion & Pace: 4  
Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner and additional functionality.

#### Implementation Quality: 3  
Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

#### Application of Techniques: 3  
Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

#### Documentation: 3  
Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

Nate's Feedback
* Table looks good. Easy to read and audit
* Creating an audit is also easy
* UI doesn't explain itself. You need to tell someone how to use it.
* Nice work rolling with technical chalenges, like LinkedIn not having any API
* We're gonna get this in use this week, so we'll let you know how it goes

Jeff's Feedback
* Checking LinkedIn, GitHub matching of names
* Select the fields for review
* Would need Census to require the URLs
* LinkedIn locks you out easily
* Would like to improve speed (needs caching)
* Risk: used begin/rescue, but, uhhhhh, but, uhhhh
* Pitfall: checkboxes with materialize
* Demo: ugh.

## Community

### Feedback
#### Quantified Self

"This is my second project with Daniel (first was Headcount in mod 1). I've enjoyed being able to come full circle on this particular pairing because I remember in mod 1 it took a couple days for us to find a workflow and pace, and this time I think we hit a better groove, and much faster. Daniel has such a strong work ethic and rocked all the javascript. Not only that, but he's a really great teacher. I definitely felt a big struggle learning javascript but Daniel's explanations got me up to speed much faster than if I'd continued to suffer on my own to the point that we were even able to divide some tasks to do solo which I really liked because it helped me feel more confident in my javascript skills. Daniel would frequently pause to make sure I understood what was happening in the project for the pieces that were confusing to me. He'll be a great asset to any team, and I imagine also a great mentor to other developers he works with as he continues to grow and learn." - Erin to Daniel

"Quantified Self was my second project with Erin, and I have to say it's always been great to work with her. Erin consistently kept the project on track, especially with Pivotal Tracker(which I kept ignoring). Her time management skills helped us time-box issues that we were stuck on, which in turn helped us move on with the project so that we would never really be behind. Erin was also able to pick up JavaScript fairly quickly and was using ES6 syntax and writing shared functions by the end. I also had a great learning experience when Erin took over the user experience side of the project and lead the styling session. Overall, I think Erin has the skills to work in either front-end or back-end environment, and her management skills will be valuable to any project." - Me to Erin


#### Briefcase
##### From Group
"jThis was my second time being partners with Dan on a project. Dan had a huge impact on our project as he was able to lay down all the ground work of how to use react.js. Dan always impresses me on how well and quickly he can teach himself a new concept. Along that same line, Dan is really easy to pair and get along with. I also went to Dan's spike on SQL which I thought was really well put together and I learned a lot from. Dan is certainly one of the best programmers I have pair with a Turing. Team Briefacase 4 lyfe" - Anthony to Daniel

"This was my first time working with Daniel, but I had heard many people talk about how great he is to pair with.  I really enjoyed paring on our final projects with Daniel.  There was one time during the project that he noticed we were losing steam in the project.  He made sure to bring it up in our retro and asked to pair on the next tasks in the project.  I really appreciated the acknowledgment that the group was losing steam and enjoyed pairing the rest of the project.  I thought we worked well together and delivered a great product.  My only feedback to Daniel is to have more confidence in himself outside of his work ethic.  He would be great on any team and can bring out the best in the teams he works in. He is a great guy and I am happy to have gotten to know him as a person outside of Turing as well.  I really enjoyed the team dynamic we had for our final project and would work with Daniel anytime." - Matt to Daniel

##### To Group
"Anthony is a quick learner and was usually the one to round up the group to get work done. Anthony helped a lot in making sure we got our cards done and had the project on track. There were definitely days where I didn't really know what the best thing to focus on was, and Anthony would point out what we should do (like it was obvious). Anthony's attention to detail and critical thinking definitely helped us make a high quality product in the end. I think he will find success in either front-end or back-end environment. " - Me to Anthony

"Matt was a huge help in modeling the server side architecture and refactoring the client-side components. There was a time where the project seemed a little lost, and he helped clean up some muddy design decisions that was bogging down the whole project. I thought the project began picking up momentum from there. I was pleasantly surprised at how solid Matt is at designing a website. He even fixed our navbar during our eval! I think his logical thinking and attention to design will make him a valuable team member on any team, whether it's front-end or backend." - Me to Matt


### Posse Reflection
The Turing Lab posse was a great place to experiment. I think working with hardware would actually be really cool in the future. I found the guest speaker inspiring after he showed all the projects he worked on with physical equipment. However, that's probably way down the line.


### Professional Development
#### StrengthsFinder: What's next?
During this session we talked about what we wanted to accomplish after Turing. I thought it would be cool to be an active speaker / leader of a Meetup. It would feel like I made it as a developer at that point.

#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up: Imposter Syndrome
During this session, we talked about things that we were most afraid of. I was probably most afraid of having the right conversation when having coffee meet ups but also making it clear I was trying to get a job.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Small individual shortcomings lead to large collective failures. Systemic issues from the past are unlikely to be remedied by neutral responses in the present.Small individual "anti-biases" can address systemic biases. These patterns are important when thinking about diversity at the work place.

#### Automation
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Lots of jobs are replaced by machines. As a result, lots of people are being laid off and adding to unemployment. It is the duty of the citizens to be informed since a common "solution" to this problem is universal basic income. As people in technology, we may have a higher advantage to adapt to technological changes than others.

#### Universal Basic Income
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Jobs are being replaced, so a popular current solution is to have Universal Basic Income. Some smart people like Elon Musk say it's inevitable. The concept is being implemented in some areas of the world. The rich are most likely to be taxed to support this.

### Other Requirements
#### Spike Session
* [Spike Markdown](https://github.com/dshinzie/some_sql_spike/)

I led a spike talking about some more intermediate SQL concepts that I learned at my last job. Topics included using aliases, views, and functions (stored procedures).

### Notes (From Nate)

- Great finish with your final assessment
- Although there wasn't much solo work this module, your group work really shined. Good work.
- You're really technically talented, and not afraid to take on tasks your own. However, you seem distracted and in your own head a lot of the time. It's going to make it hard for you to collaborate as you go through your career, and I encourage you to find strategies to address it.

### Outcome

Recommended for Graduation
