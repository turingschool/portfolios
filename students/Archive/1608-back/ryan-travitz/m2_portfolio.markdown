# Ryan Travitz - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Academically this module, I sought to gain a solid understanding of Sinatra, Rails, and building MVC web apps to rely on in the future.

I also set a goal to participate in a group with an effective distributed workflow. All of my module 1 projects required constant in-person coordination between team members.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Casey

**Evaluation Notes:**
My main area for continued improvement after this eval is to keep looking for ways to move logic down the stack. Even if a chained method call seems simple, it can probably be combined into a single, tested model method.

**Scores**

*Conceptual Understanding |*
 **4**: Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree*o**f specificity and accuracy without assistance

*Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking |*
 **4**: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

*Feature Completeness |*
**4**: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

*ActiveRecord Syntax and Style |*
 **4**: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods independently and can articulately discuss the difference between relationships at the model and database level

*Rails Style |*
 **3**: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

*Testing |*
 **4**: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently

*Collaboration |*
 **4**: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of my second six weeks at Turing, I had the opportunity to work on several individual projects: Mix-Master, Rails Mini-Project, and Job Tracker. I received threes and fours for Job Tracker, the only graded project of the three. Through all of them, I grew in my understanding of Rails.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

For this project, I used Rails, Postgres, and Bootstrap to make an app that tracks job opportunities. The app has CRUD functionality for jobs, companies, contacts, and comments.

**Evaluation Comments**

Great work on this project ðŸŽ‰ i left you a few comments on how to refactor to improve your code, but overall, this is very solid. don't forget sad paths and error handling. let me know if you have questions!

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Database, Relationships, and Migrations |*
**4**: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

*Routes |*
**3**: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

*Controllers |*
**3**: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

*ActiveRecord |*
**3**: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

*Views |*
**4**: Logic has been removed from views and controllers to the full degree possible, the developer ha minimized the number of variables passed to the view, and the developer can articulately explain their strategies for extracting this logic. The developer uses partials to reduce duplication of code in the view layer.

*User Experience |*
**4**: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

*Testing |*
**3**: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

#### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/point-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

The mini project helped solidify my understanding of namespacing and how routes relate to controllers. Having admins with limited abilities also helped me to better understand how to secure an application. This was also the first project on which I started to work on customizing my CSS.


#### Mix-Master

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix-Master helped solidify my understanding of basic CRUD functionality, including how models, views, and controllers all work together.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Beyond just improving technical abilities, group projects at Turing are an excellent opportunity to grow in important communication and interpersonal skills. This Mod, group projects were also a great opportunity to explore project management strategies.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This project used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

**Evaluation Scores**

*Functional Expectations |*
**3**: Application fulfills base expectations

*Test-Driven Development |*
**3**: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components |*
**3**: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

*Fundamental Ruby & Style |*
**3**: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Sinatra / Web and Business Logic |*
**3**: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

*View Layer |*
**4**: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

**Feedback**

"Ryan you were a great team member to work on a project with.  You were motivated, hard working, and supportive of our whole group.  I really appretiate how willing you were to answer all of my questions and take the time to make sure I understood concepts.  I would say the main thing you could improve on would be to speak up as soon as you start feeling frustrated or unsatisfied with how the project/group is going in any way. Calling a little retro right away or at the next pomodoro could really help cue the team into what you are thinking and ensure we can all perform our best together.  That aside I would be stoked to work on another project with you and am always greatful for you cool attitude and proffesionalism.""

*-From Jon Kimble*

Ryan described our group as "healthy" and I think that is
a very accurate description. Every time I have a group that
doesn't blow up I'm grateful but this group definately exceeded
that. We overcame different learning styles, worked through
some stressful situations and I think we all walked away
knowing more than we would otherwise had we not had the strong
communications skills and unified goals that we had.
When I overheard other groups communicating I was particularly
grateful of my team. I also have to say I learned a shitload
of hotkeys from Ryan and tht was awesome, I'd say my hotkey game
is on a whole other level now so thanks for that. Ryan and I
bumped heads on a few things and but i think we handled it well
and were able to stay cognicesant of ourselves and the way we
were reacting. Which ultimately lead to both our growth.
If there was one thing I'd say to improve on I think it would be
trying to manage impatience a little better. But as I said to
Jon ultimately I'd chalk this one up as a solid win.

*-From Vido Seaver*


## D: Professional Skills
Professional skills sessions help us become complete developers and prepare us to work as part of teams and organizations.

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This Gear Up focused on what it means to be a citizen and whether or not it is important to vote. After discussion, my group ended up talking about what makes a good leader. My big takeaway from the session was to look for leaders who are willing to protect and sacrifice themselves for their teams (or constituents).

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This Gear Up focused on how introverts work. It made me think about how geared the Western world is toward extroverts. I am now more cognizant to leave space for deep thought when working on tasks and in groups.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This was probably the most controversial of the three Gear Up discussions that I had. My group went back and forth about whether resilience is something that can be created in others. I came to the conclusion that circumstances can be set up to allow somebody to grow in their resilience, but the person still needs to overcome the circumstances and gain it themselves.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding New Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)

**Deliverable**
* [Job Tracking Board](https://trello.com/b/GYLwq6GZ/ryan-travitz-job-board)

When finding interesting companies, whether they currently have open junior positions is not the most important thing. In this workshop, I learned about finding companies through non-traditional means like Meetup and discovering potential contacts. After this session, I created a Job Tracking Board on Trello with companies and contacts.

#### Collaborative Communication

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)

**Deliverable**: A reflection on project management strategies and feedback.

1. My group for Rush Hour did not have strong project management strategies. We primarily conducted all of our work together, which slowed our pace. For Little Shop, we coordinated tasks over Waffle, reviewed code on Github through comments and pull requests, and had daily checkins at the beginning and end of the day to make sure we were all on the same page. This allowed us to assign people as needed to tasks and move quickly while maintaining quality in our code.

2. After the first group project, the main constructive criticism I received was to work on tempering my impatience when the group moved slowly. I worked on this is in my next group project in a couple of ways. First, I made sure my group knew that it was something I was working on so that they could help catch me. I then made a point to work on being more self-aware.


#### Cold Outreach
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/tree/master/module_two)

**Deliverable**: Email to a potential contact

-------------------
Hi Jared,

I found you through a mutual contact, Jackie Cheng, and am interested in your work as a developer in D.C. I am moving back soon from Colorado and am trying to learn more about the tech industry in the city. I saw you worked previously at Contactually and BSD, both of which I think are very cool. I would love the chance to ask you a few questions about your past work and experience as a developer in general. Are you available for a phone or video call next Tuesday at 3pm?

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I appreciated working with you on Little Shop. I am often in awe of your ability to research and devise solutions to problems on your own. You set the bar for quickly consuming new languages and tools. I agree with your assessment that we share a penchant to get  fixated on issues. My one piece critical feedback is to be cognizant of that trait in yourself (you already are) and know how long you can burn on an individual issue. And I think while that trait can be spun as a negative, it is also one of your greatest strengths. Again, it was a pleasure working on the same group in this project. I learned a lot from you throughout and would be thrilled with any chance to work together in the future.

*-For Joey Stansfield*

I appreciated that you took over the project manager tasks for this project. You set the tone for our workflow early on, and as a result we had an easy time working as a team. Our workflow made me feel like a real developer and was a highlight of the project for me. I also appreciated your constant positivity and reassurances. Thank you!

*-For Ben Pepper*

Throughout Little Shop, I appreciated you for your flexibility, work ethic, and even keel. You were willing to work on any part of the project that the group needed and it was always easy to pair with you. I was especially thankful when you went back at the end of the project to check our work against the base requirements. My one piece of constructive feedback would be to make sure that your opinions are heard. I think that sometimes you can be quieter during group decisions. It would be interesting to see what happens if you are a project manager in future groups!

*-For Anthony Ciccone*

Jon exemplified grace through adversity during this project. He struggled at times with some of the material, but he remained engaged and found many ways to support our goals despite the academic challenges. I think he did an especially good job balancing the differing ideas that Vido and I had at times. I think the main area that Jon could improve on is in not falling too silent when he feels out of his comfort zone, even if it seems somehow like it is to the detriment of the group (itâ€™s not really!) It was especially great to see Jon take charge in areas where he felt more comfortable with the subject matter. Jonâ€™s commitment to clear communication about our groupâ€™s dynamic and overall working plan also contributed heavily to our overall success.

*-For Jon Kimble*

Vido taught me a lot about working in a group over the course of this project, which I very much appreciate. From the start, he was insistent on communicating regularly and plainly about our group dynamic and plan. This insistence on clear discussion helped us particularly in the beginning when we were struggling more with the subject matter. When I felt frustration about our pace, he made sure I expressed it instead of keeping it under the surface. Vido also had a great grasp of the technical parts of the project. Though we disagreed on the direction the project should take at times, his commitment to clear communication and the other members of the group contributed heavily to our overall success.

*-For Vido Seaver*


### Being a Community Member

Ryan was our details and styling guru. His attention to detail can not be matched. He was always able and willing to make sure that everything was perfect before we moved onto the next card/feature/or problem. He was awesome to pair with and was always able to have a different point of view that helped me understand the problem better. Ryan has a tenacity that I dont see often and it was amazing watching him tackle a problem or see a PR submitted late into the night on something he just HAD to figure out. Our Little Shop would not have been nearly as amazing without his contributions and workflow.

*-From Ben Pepper*

I appreciated Ryan's patients when I paired with him and he was awesome to work with. When writing a feature test he would always check in to make sure we were on the same page before moving on to the next test. I also thought Ryan's work ethic was awesome. At the beginning of our project he went back an commented on all the waffle cards to make sure we were covering all of our base requirements. Would gladly be in another group project with Ryan.

*-From Anthony Ciccone*

Ryan, I had a great time working on little shop with you. Youâ€™re someone I know I can trust to get the work done, and that made it really easy and stress free to split up everything the way that we did. Itâ€™s really inspiring to watch to dive into new technologies and master them. Your vim skills are setting the bar in terms of workflow and Iâ€™ll be spending most of break trying to catch up. With our project complete, and motivation to keep working low, itâ€™s a weird day to give critical feedback. But Iâ€™ll try: you and I both have pretty obsessive personalities. Itâ€™s easy to get fixated on an issue and lose site of the base functionality. Itâ€™s also easy to look at someone elseâ€™s code or style and be critical of it. I actually think you should do more of this. In the beginning of our project you mentioned git naming conventions a few times and the rest of us continued to name things poorly and you stopped bringing it up. Iâ€™m just assuming here that you didnâ€™t want to be â€œon our case." But really, I think our project would feel a lot cleaner if we did a better job of naming commits and tests and generally did a better job of following convention. Again, Iâ€™m guessing, but I think you have a pretty good understanding of this stuff. So my suggestion is that you step into a project management role and be the hound. I think you want it and I think youâ€™d be good at it. Overall really great work on little shop. The work flow on this project has made me excited to be a developer. I learned a lot from you and would be excited to work with you again.

### Playing a Part

This module, I continued my engagement with Turing functions. I consistently attended guest speakers, mixers, and various Armstrong Posse gatherings.

I also contributed to the community this module by coordinating the Module 2 pairing with Module 1 students. Beyond just coordinating, I offered four hours per week for pairing, at least three of which were taken each week.

Finally, I have helped prospective students and incoming students this module. I worked one weekend as a TA at a Try Turing event, and I have also been serving as a Pre-work Advisor for a 1611 student.

### Posse Reflection

As part of Armstrong posse this module, I had the chance to participate in workshops about linear regression, neural networks, and python. In the linear regression workshop, we implemented a regression model to predict a NFL teamâ€™s final record based on historical data. In the neural network workshop, we built a perceptron, which is a basic piece of the larger system. Finally, we did a little bit of work in Python, which is widely used for data analysis and machine learning.


My favorite part of the posse experience was the exposure to other areas of programming. I found increasing my understanding of machine learning, a set of ideas that will be important to the future of computing, to be extremely valuable. In addition to being my favorite part of participating in the posse, this exposure to machine learning concepts and another programming language will make me a better-rounded professional.
