# Ryan Travitz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Academically, this module I sought to gain a solid understanding of Ruby and Object-Oriented principles to rely on in the future.

I also set personal goals to immerse myself in every part of the Turing experience. It's important to me to commit to things all the way. In this context, that meant focusing on attending as many speakers and events as possible, jumping into a posse, and bonding with my cohort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the first six week at Turing, I have had the opportunity to work on two individual projects: Jungle Beat and Event Reporter. I received threes and fours across both projects. From the first project to the second project, I grew in my ability to separate parts of my logic and test them separately and together.

-----------

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project focused on using an iterative development process. Through this process, I learned about how to break programs into logical components, test those components in isolation and combination, and utilize classes. I also learned how to create a linked list data structure.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* All iterations plus both extensions
* Well tested, but check older tests, make sure tests actually test your intent.
* Used both recursion and iterative approaches.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations |*
**4**: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

*Test-Driven Development |*
**3**: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components |*
**4**: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style |*
**3**:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion |*
**4**: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

-----------------

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

For this project, I created an interactive querying and reporting tool that could handle messy datasets. The program implemented a REPL that a user could query for information about attendees to an event. The user could then generate CSV and HTML reports from saved searches.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* 20 tests
* Used Faraday
* Overall, really good project, extensions complete.
* Look for more ways to test both happy and sad paths.
* Great instinct on how to handle testing messages printed to screen.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations |*
**4**: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions, or a custom extension to be approved by an instructor.

*REPL Interface |*
**4**: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface

*Test-Driven Development |*
**3**: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

*Breaking Logic into Components |*
**3**: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

*Fundamental Ruby & Style |*
**3**: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Enumerables and Collections |*
**3**: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

*HTML and Style |*
**4**: Uses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Beyond just improving technical abilities, group projects at Turing are an excellent opportunity to grow in important communication and interpersonal skills.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganslimak/Complete_Me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

This project focused on making a simple textual autocomplete system. To finish this project, my partner and I implemented the trie data structure and used File I/O to populate it with a dictionary of roughly 250,000 words. When presented with a fragment of a word, the program would suggest all possible completions and weight suggestions by past usage. As an extension to the project, we also made a simple GUI with Shoes.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mark

* great test coverage
* good use of recursion where necessary
* separated responsibilities and use of private methods

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations |*
**4**: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

*Test-Driven Development |*
**4**: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components |*
**4**: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style |*
**4**: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

*Enumerable & Collections |*
**4**: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

**Feedback**

*-From Morgan Slimak:*

Ryan was a fantastic partner on the CompleteMe project, and very easy to work with. When we first met and interacted prior to the project I had my concerns, solely because I had been in the Echo group and Ryan was previously in Foxtrot. However, once we actually began on the project, Ryan proved to be an extremely valuable asset, driving much of the project and figuring out some incredible solutions, such as how we could get our program to work recursively in true trie fashion. In our partnership, Ryan actively came ready to accommodate my unorthodox personality. It was a great pleasure working with Ryan.

--------------


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [DTR](https://slack-files.com/files-pri-safe/T029P2S9M-F2EGEUVRQ/headcount_dtr_ryan-dan.pdf?c=1474510040-e58b3b58cb3803763cbda3e6cd0e6e1df8f56829)

For this project, we were required to take in and analyze a large amount of data about Colorado school districts. Our application was split into several parts, including parsers, repositories, and analysis tools.

**Evaluation Comments**

Assessed by: Beth


* Got through 4 and added 6
* Testing overall strong, would like to see more unit testing with stubbing or mocking
* SRP generally upheld; only shortcoming is methods juggling a lot of responsibility
* Style overall strong, some weird things with returning true/false when simple condition would suffice
* Some great use of enumerables (group_by) but opportunities to replace each in certain scenarios with better choices
* O sanitation errors

**Evaluation Scores**

*Functional Expectations |*
**3**: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

*Test-Driven Development |*
**3**: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components |*
**3**: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

*Fundamental Ruby & Style |*
**3**:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Enumerable & Collections |*
**3**: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

*Code Sanitation |*
**4**: Zero complaints

**Feedback**

*-From Dan Olson*

I was very fortunate to be able to work with Ryan Travitz on Headcount. It was an absolute pleasure to work with him throughout this project. Ryan’s work ethic and teaching ability is second to none. He would constantly check in with me for understanding and was always willing to explain something that I wasn’t totally clear on. Also, he would regularly check in with me to see if I had input on a specific problem or error we were facing. The only negative that I ever experienced, and not really a negative, is that he did like to drive when we were on to something important. However, he never let me feel like I was left in the dust. Like I said before, he would always check in with me before moving on to the next iteration or method we were building. Ryan is extremely talented and is able to see the code much deeper than most people and has a strong fundamental understanding of how objects work together and interconnect. His insight and vision are astonishing and I see him going very far in this career. It’s been my absolute pleasure working with him and he has taught me so much. I’m not sure that I could have had a better partner for this massive project with such a cool head and great personality.


## D: Professional Skills

Professional skills sessions help us become complete developers and prepare us to work as part of teams and organizations.


### Gear Up
#### The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This session had some remarkable revelations for me about what keeps women out of tech. One of the primary causes is cultural influence. Women in our society are inundated with messages from a young age about what kinds of activities they should be pursuing. It's reflected in things from movies to the marketing of toys. The discussion after the documentary raised a question that I'm still thinking about: how do we tackle a problem this large? For me and my group, the answer was to try to live by your personal convictions and to stand up when you see something wrong. One person can't change society, but enough voices can, albeit slowly.


#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This session had me thinking more intentionally about my group interactions. During the first part of the discussion, I took a strong stance. A member of the group later pointed out to me that while I had only said things that everyone agreed with, a person with differing views could have been stifled. Before that conversation, I had not been as aware of potential team member boundaries as I could have been.


#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This was an absolutely incredible session to attend. Following the video and the discussion, I began to think about all of my routine actions based on the cognitive drain that they place on me. This thinking persists to this day, and I have used it to streamline things about my life from my technical workflow to decisions that I make when I get up in the morning. This session was also a valuable reminder to celebrate victories among the challenges.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

**Completed Deliverables**
* [Github](https://github.com/rtravitz)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rtravitz)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtravitz)

This session focused on passive branding and job searching tools, including Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, and a resume. Each of these profiles needs to offer a profile picture and tell a consistent story about me as a software developer. Following this session, I completed my Github profile, updated by Twitter to have a cleaner look, and changed my information on LinkedIn to represent myself as a Software Developer attending Turing. This is an ongoing project. I am also still working on a resume, which is due to Lia at the beginning of the next module.

-----------------

#### Personal Branding Part II

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p2.md)

This session focused on building a personal website. Important considerations for making the personal website include making sure to market to non-technical recruiters, having a personal statement that tells your story as a career-changer, and having readily accessible project examples. The deliverables for this are due in the next module.

---------------------

#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [DTR](https://slack-files.com/files-pri-safe/T029P2S9M-F2EGEUVRQ/headcount_dtr_ryan-dan.pdf?c=1474510040-e58b3b58cb3803763cbda3e6cd0e6e1df8f56829)

This session taught us how to hold a DTR conversation. Setting expectations up front is important to any relationship. At times it is also necessary to have a reset conversation if expectations are broken. Above is a DTR form from my Headcount project with Dan Olson.

---------------------

#### StrengthsFinder: The Challenge of Affirming My Strengths

* [Affirming Strengths Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNEaPgGkYIMfMtfHnQ2KxT-zX3tnBCx8jYFCrvwhbkA/edit?usp=sharing)

In this session, we worked with Allison and a small group to affirm our natural talents based on the results of the StrengthsFinder test. I am providing the worksheet that we filled out from this session in which we wrote about a challenge and then affirmed our strength.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*To Daniel Shin:*

Daniel has been an integral part of our community this module, particularly because of how he organizes events. From the first week on, Daniel has regularly planned activities, including sports in the park each weekend, a hiking trip, a free concert, and other social get-togethers. He posts all of the things he plans publicly, so that anyone from our cohort, or from the entire school, can come along too. His efforts have allowed me to meet and bond with people whom I otherwise would have only known in passing. I am writing this feedback because I want to make sure that his valuable community-building is recognized.


*-To Morgan Slimak:*

I appreciated working with Morgan on CompleteMe. Beyond his ability to program, Morgan brought admirable work ethic and personal flexibility to the project. At all times, Morgan was ready to jump in and work and was open to working together or separately on any part of the project. Working with Morgan was just an easy and enjoyable experience, and I hope to have the chance to be on a team with him again.


*-To Jon Kimble:*

Jon is a personal inspiration to me at Turing because of the way that he carries himself and interacts with others. I am particularly impressed by his ability to tackle things that I find daunting such as interacting with existing members of the tech community. By the end of this module, Jon will have already been to multiple events in the area and started tentatively looking at the job market. I have no doubt that he will excel in this area because of his natural ability to authentically engaging with any individual’s interests. I think everyone at Turing could learn something from his example.


*-To Dan Olson:*

I had the opportunity to work with Dan on Headcount, affectionately described on its Github template repo as "a whopper of a project." Throughout what was sometimes a trying experience, Dan was a very supportive partner. I appreciated his work ethic and flexibility. But more than anything else, I was impressed by Dan’s communication. We re-DTR’d several times—not for anything negative, but rather just to make sure that we remained on the same page. Without his commitment to communicating clearly and effectively, I’m sure our partnership would not have gone as smoothly.  


### Being a Community Member

*-From Daniel Shin*

Ryan has consistently been on top of his tasks in Module 1 and has always been a solid resource to reach out to for any questions. This includes everything from assignment details to Gear Up and Spike information. He has also been very involved with extracurricular Turing events and encourages others in his cohort to be involved as well. In all honesty, his encouragement to attend Turing extracurricular sessions has helped me develop a better perspective of this program as a whole, and I believe that without his push I would be maintaining a narrow view of Turing.


*-From Morgan Slimak*

Ryan was a fantastic partner on the CompleteMe project, and very easy to work with. When we first met and interacted prior to the project I had my concerns, solely because I had been in the Echo group and Ryan was previously in Foxtrot. However, once we actually began on the project, Ryan proved to be an extremely valuable asset, driving much of the project and figuring out some incredible solutions, such as how we could get our program to work recursively in true trie fashion. In our partnership, Ryan actively came ready to accommodate my unorthodox personality. It was a great pleasure working with Ryan.


*-From Jon Kimble*

Ryan has been a huge help to me during my time at Turing, he has always made himself available to answer any questions I or my teammates may have.  He has a calm and conversational way of explaining concepts that leaves me walking away with understanding what is going on rather than just with an answer. He also shows great dedication to all of his work at Turing and this serves as a continued inspiration.  It is very motivating to see his focus, the high standard of performance he holds himself to, and the quality of work he produces. Ryan is a great guy to be around and adds to all of our experience at Turing in numerous ways.

*-From Dan Olson*

I was very fortunate to be able to work with Ryan Travitz on Headcount. It was an absolute pleasure to work with him throughout this project. Ryan’s work ethic and teaching ability is second to none. He would constantly check in with me for understanding and was always willing to explain something that I wasn’t totally clear on.

I’m not sure that I could have had a better partner for this massive project with such a cool head and great personality.


### Playing a Part

During Module 1, I have attended all Turing functions, including guest speakers, Gear-ups, mixers, and various Pahlka Posse gatherings.

I also try to empower myself to improve our community whenever I see something that I can fix or improve. This module, that ended up being small things like taking over cleaning duties when one member of the cohort had to leave to pick up his kids from school or grabbing a broom and dustpan to sweep up broken glass from a bottle that smashed down the back staircase over the weekend.

Next module, I hope to continue my involvement and in particular start to raise it by participating with more groups like Kids Who Code. I have also started working with Calaway to transition responsibility for organizing Module 2's pairings with Module 1 students.
