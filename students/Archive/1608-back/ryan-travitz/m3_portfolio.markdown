# Ryan Travitz - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Academically this module I sought to focus on building my Rails knowledge with more advanced concepts.

I also set a personal goal to learn about Go. I think the language is exciting, and I want to come out of Turing having pushed myself to the edge of my abilities.

## Rubric Scores

* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Sally

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of my third six weeks at Turing, I had the opportunity to work on two solo projects. ApiCurious taught me about consuming external APIs, a big step in my progression. The self-directed project allowed me to meet one of my goals of the module to gain a working knowledge of Go.

#### Self-Directed Project: COParkFinder

* [API (Go)](https://github.com/rtravitz/coparkfinder)
* [Frontend (JS)](https://github.com/rtravitz/coparkfinder-front)
* [Alexa Skill (Python)](https://github.com/rtravitz/coparkfinder-alexa)

For this project I used Go, Javascript, and Python to make a service that helps people find Colorado State Parks to visit based on the activities they would like to do and the facilities they would like to have available.

The Go JSON API, backed by a Postgres database, serves up information to the Javascript frontend, and the Alexa Skill. To find parks, users can submit forms or simply ask the Amazon Echo to find a park by certain criteria. For example, a user could ask to find a park with boating, fishing, and full-hookup campsites.

#### Evaluation Scores

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

- Go API, separate JS front end
- Seeded DB by hand with parks info

## C: Group Work & Projects

Beyond just improving technical abilities, group projects at Turing are an excellent opportunity to grow in important communication and interpersonal skills. This Mod, group projects were also a great opportunity to explore project management strategies.

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

In this paired project, we used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API, which exposes Sales Data for a collection of merchants. Notably, controller tests drove the design, and Ruby and ActiveRecord were used to perform complicated business intelligence.

#### Evaluation Scores

Assessed by: Nate

Notes:

- Good work
- A great API tests for bad requests, and how the API responds to them
- I think your SQL can be shorter, but not enough that I'm willing to put in the effort
- Consistent indentation

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

**Feedback**

It was great working with Ryan on Rails Engine, which was possibly the most daunting project at Turing simply from reputation. We were able to coordinate without any struggle and finished the project early. Ryan's attention to detail and natural problem solving skills helped greatly when new issues were found, and his general oversight of the project helped us do a stellar job on all the assignments

### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/pushpin)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

In this group project, we built a platform from scratch that allowed users to hire professionals to work on projects. This platform was based on the real service Thumbtack. Primary learning objectives for the project included implementing multitenancy, handling file uploads, and building an internal API.

**Feedback**

Working with Ryan on Cloney Island was a pleasure. He had many immeasurable contributions to our team, regularly taking on whatever needed to be done. We all easily noted how detail oriented he is when debugging. In addition he eagerly jumped into working on setting up the AWS S3 and integrating it into the messaging between users. When a team shift was needed, he moved over to support another team member to support the overall needs of the team. Also, he has great jokes : )

*-From Ali Schlereth*

Ryan was our project manager for Cloney Island project - PushPin, and he has done an excellent job of managing the project progress as well as making sure everybody is on the same page throughout the project. I really appreciated the way he attacks known and unknown problems that come up. Ryan is a hard worker and his backend programming and front end styling skills were crucial in getting this project complete.  

*-From Alisher Sadikov*

Ryan was such a great partner for this project. He was always very eager to help anyone and jump in on any aspect of the project. I know we all wish we had the time to deliver a more polished final product, but I know we wouldn't have made even close to the same progress without Ryan! He was also super understanding of everyone's schedules and commitments, which is always appreciated in a larger group project. I would gladly work with Ryan again in the future!

## D: Professional Skills
Professional skills sessions help us become complete developers and prepare us to work as part of teams and organizations.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

I attended the Microaggressions 101 session in order to build my understanding. After the introductory readings, my group had a great discussion where we tried to think about ourselves in the described situations. I am now more aware of microaggressions after this Gear Up, which while help me going forward as I work with diverse groups of people

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This Gear Up focused on being able to emphasize with end users. To practice, we used the journey mapping process to analyze an experience we had, had in the past. In my case, this was a trip to the DMV. I can see how in the future, I could use this technique to find strengths and opportunities for improvement in my projects.

#### Grit Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This Gear Up focused on the definition of grit and how it could help us at Turing. Some discussion from the larger cohort that stuck out to me was some groups wondering if saying somebody was not "gritty" enough could be used as a way to gloss over other underlying problems. Overall, however, I think the general consensus was that some base level of grit is needed to succeed in an environment like Turing.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Project Pitch

* [COParkFinder Pitch Gist](https://gist.github.com/rtravitz/1ca6bce63a8b8c6b2c9c8b79a595a73f)

#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)

* [Completed Flower Exercise](https://gist.github.com/rtravitz/5e237e83241ca3f8f89e9f66f7f88d84)

#### Mock Interviews

I have currently done two technical interview sessions. One, a mock, was with Turing mentor Andrew Thal. The second was a real interview with an engineering director at Allstate.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*For Daniel Shin:*
I felt incredibly lucky to have Daniel as a partner for Rails Engine. I was nervous before the project, primarily because of its reputation and the complicated ActiveRecord and SQL queries necessary for completion. Daniel knows a lot about SQL, and he was an excellent teacher. It's not an exaggeration to say that I may not have been able to complete Rails Engine or my personal project, which requires many raw SQL queries, if I hadn't learned from Daniel. Beyond his patience as a teacher, Daniel was also an excellent partner for my work style. We discussed and distributed work efficiently and had a positive working environment throughout the project.

*For Megan Talbot:*
Megan was an excellent team member on Cloney Island. I repeatedly saw her jump on whichever part of the project needed her, even if it wasn't an easy or glamorous task like user ratings. Though at times we faced difficult problems, pairing with Megan was always a positive experience, and I am grateful that we had the chance to work on a team while at Turing.

*For Alisher Sadikov:*
Working with Alisher on Cloney Island was a great experience. Alisher is notable for his work ethic among a student body that does not lack for it. As part of a group that struggled to give critical feedback at times, I also appreciated that he pushed us to offer constructive comments in order to better each other. He contributed a great deal to our final product, and I am grateful that we had the chance to work together.

*For Ali Schlereth:*
I appreciated working with Ali on Cloney Island. On the project, she showed great organization and attention to detail that benefitted our group. When plans needed to be drawn up, or issues closed off the waffle board, Ali was the person to take responsibility for these important, occasionally overlooked tasks. I also appreciated Ali's willingness to dive into unknown territory with me. Perhaps the highlight of the project for me was pairing together to host our photos on AWS.

## F: Additional Information

### Posse Reflection

As part of Turing Lab this module, I had the chance to explore something I was excited about: Alexa, Amazon's natural language processing SDK. During posse meetings, I learned how to host a script in an AWS Lambda Function, design and implement a voice interaction schema, and eventually create my own custom Alexa applications. Without the space and time that Turing Lab afforded me to explore, I'm not sure I would have been able to integrate an Alexa app into my self-directed project.

One other takeaway that I get every week from Turing Lab is a boost to my excitement about programming and tech. The posse is full of activities and discussions that, at least for me, spark new ideas.
