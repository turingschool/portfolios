## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Pass

##### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

##### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

##### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

##### 6. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

##### 7. Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Open Source (Figaro)

*   [Bug Report](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/issues/259)
*   [Pull Request](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/pull/262)
*   [Documentation PR](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/pull/263)
*   [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@jstans12/being-a-part-of-it-9441a5711cdc#.3a3zt324g)

I worked on the Figaro gem to fix a reported bug. Previously, when users ran `bundle exec figaro install` if they were already ignoring application.yml in .gitignore, the ignore line would be appended again. Now, if it is already ignored, nothing will happen in .gitignore.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/quantified-self-starter-kit)

Quantified Self is a calorie tracker allows you to add foods to a list and then add those foods to meals. It helped us understand OOP in javascript.

##### Comments

* 42 tests, mostly feature.
* Fully functional app, no bugs.
* I like how meals are combined.

##### Scores

##### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

##### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

##### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

##### JS syntax and Style

- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

##### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

##### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

##### Feedback to Me

What can I say Joey, you just get it. Your ability to work your way through a challenging group environment and build out software is remarkable. Working with you was a pleasure. I appreciate your willingness to let me branch out on the project and focus on Dev Ops. I wish I had more time to work more closely with you on the code base because it would have provided me the opportunity to learn something from the top student in our class. Thank you for all of your hard work and diligent work ethic. Working with you again was a pleasure. - Nick

#### Census

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/census)

Census is an identity provider for Turing School. It provides authentication for a bunch of other apps and also serves and API with student, staff and mentor data.

##### Notes

* All stories and bugs completed.
* Good documentation.
* Code generally well written and well factored.

##### Scores

##### 1. Project Management

* 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

##### 2. Completion & Pace

* 3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

##### 3. Implementation Quality

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

##### 4. Application of Techniques

* 3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

##### 5. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

##### Feedback to Me

Positive: You're laid back and easy to work with, yet you get things done.
Constructive: Work to verbalize your thought process. Don't take anything for granted when working with other juniors who may not be up to speed. - Brad

#### Yearbook

 Yearbook is a game that randomly picks a student's picture and then asks the user to match it to a name.

##### Notes
* Pulls information from Census
* Start Game -> Select a Cohort -> Guessing
* Scoped out the robots / people without
* Tracker: good
* Census: added a few routes before starting Yearbook
* "Discovered" that really only one person can play the game at a time
* Lots of extra controllers
* Conclusion: start from scratch
* Proud: "I added some tests"

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Diversity is important and actually brings happiness and business value to the workplace.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation is probably going to be a problem eventually, but it's not certain. It seems likely that there will be certain events which cause unemployment in some areas, but I think the likelyhood of mass unemployment is still low.

#### Univeral Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Basic Income is a great solution to a bunch of problems that we actually have. While it may be the best solution to mass unemployment, I think we should stop billing it as that and start thinking of it as a more ethical way to manage welfare. Not only does it set the precedent that every person deserves a basic standard of living, it allows each individual to define that standard. It also could get rid of a lot of unnecessary paperwork.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise Follow Up

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/JStans12/51b53a8ecdf6249ad2f39fa27f2693b4)

Solidifying what's important to me in the job search. Mentorship, > $65k, New Technologies.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Nick, great work on Quantified Self. It's been great working with you these last two modules. It's clear that you've improved your git game quite a bit since Stuff Box. I'm excited to see how far down the dev-ops rabbit whole you go.
<br>
Ali, it has been great working with you on Census and throughout Turing. I admire your organization and dedication to quality work. You pushed me to do some testing and refactoring that I probably wouldn't have done on my own and I appreciate that. It's a shame that we never had the chance to work together on a more exciting project. I think that would have been a lot of fun.
<br>
Brad, nice work on census. You were super easy to work with and I enjoyed having you on my team. Your workflow is solid and I think your ability to write code is often greater than you give yourself credit for. I don't have anything critical or negative to say this module. Good look on the job hunt. I hope you can buy back your sax one day.

### Playing a Part

I was Co-Lead of the Turing Lab. I ran a basic Arduino spike on my own, and helped Kyle Zucker lead a spike on circuit bending. I also paired with Seth from mod one to help him fix a test suite error and Maia from 1608-FE on some SQL.

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

It looks like you've met all of your goals. You've definitely shown that you can work in a new and unfamiliar codebase, as well as levelled up your JavaScript. You've overall had a great attitude and have always been willing to tear into the task ahead of you. You've delivered great work throughout this entire module.
