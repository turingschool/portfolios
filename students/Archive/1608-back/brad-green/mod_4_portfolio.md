# Brad Green - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main area of emphasis in mod 4 was becoming more comfortable with JavaScript. I can safely say that I accomplished this goal. From Quantified Self to the final exam, I have written a lot of JavaScript and jQuery. I feel confident using JavaScript in Rails apps, code challenges, and taking on a React/Node project upon graduating.

I also sought to further my understanding of Ruby and Rails best practices. I'm always striving to write cleaner, more expressive code. When I look back at old projects, I'm baffled by where I was there compared to where I am now. That must mean that I'm getting better!

Finally, I wanted the capstone to simulate a real job, and I believe it did. I feel comfortable using Github and project management tools like Tracker and Waffle. I'm confident that agile workflow will feel natural in my first job because of the experience gained at Turing.

##### Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

##### User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application.

##### Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Open Source Contribution

```
Thanksgiving
```

* https://github.com/lbraun/thanksgiving

A personal philanthropy tracking web app for individuals who want to manage and stimulate their giving

I refuted a bug report and submitted two pull requests. The first pull request fixed date input and defaulted to today's date on the new donation page. It was merged. The second pull request added Factory Girl, fixed failing tests, and rewrote the entire users spec using Factory Girl. The owner of the repo did a very detailed review and requested changes on this pull request. I look forward to making these changes as soon as I can.

The documentation is quite good, and nothing I changed warranted updating the README.

I also wrote a blog post detailing the process:

## C: Group Work & Projects

```
Quantified Self
```

* Repo: https://github.com/bradgreen3/quantified-self
* Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/quantified-self.md

An application to track daily caloric intake and exercise. Compare calorie intake for each meal to predefined goals.

##### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

##### Testing

* 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type.

##### HTML/CSS/UI

* 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

##### JS syntax and Style

* 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

##### Git Workflow

* 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature.

##### Project Management

* 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.

##### Feedback

* ```From Anthony:``` I had a blast working with Brad. I think we got along really well and had a great work dynamic. Brad drove half the project and took on alot of the toughest aspects of the project. We both worked really hard and I was happy with the outcome of the project. I was partners with Brad in mod two and I feel like he improved alot in terms of taking the lead and voicing his opinions.

Yearbook
```
<br>
Notes:

- I like the planning for the future. The settings screen.
- Looks like you're handling at least a few edge cases, like students that haven't uploaded at picture. But not images that are the wrong aspect ratio...
- Yearbook is for Jeff
- Looks clean

* Pulls information from Census
* Start Game -> Select a Cohort -> Guessing
* Scoped out the robots / people without
* Tracker: good
* Census: added a few routes before starting Yearbook
* "Discovered" that really only one person can play the game at a time
* Lots of extra controllers
* Conclusion: start from scratch
* Proud: "I added some tests"

##### Feedback

* ```From Joey:``` Brad, nice work on census. You were super easy to work with and I enjoyed having you on my team. Your workflow is solid and I think your ability to write code is often greater than you give yourself credit for. I don't have anything critical or negative to say this module. Good look on the job hunt. I hope you can buy back your sax one day.

* ```From Ali:``` Brad was a great team member, especially for a four week project. I enjoyed diving into building universal search functionality together and was impressed with your research skills while we were trying to figure out SAML.  Thanks for being a great collaborator with dedication.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown

I have mixed feelings about this Gear Up. I understand that everyone wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like them can lead to disastrous results, but what's the alternative? It's hard to tell someone, particularly a member of a minority group, that they shouldn't want to be around people who look like them. How about we make the narrative, "I want to be around at least 1/3 people who look like me, but no more than 1/2"?

#### Automation

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown

I frequently hear the argument that technology has displaced jobs in the past and the market adjusted. While this is true, I think we're entering uncharted territory. The sophistication of today's technology is displacing workers throughout the economy, not just in a single sector as it did before. The rate of job loss is also unlike anything we've seen. This might explain why workforce participation is so low compared to even just a few decades ago.

#### Universal Basic Income

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

Because the rate of job loss is so sudden and so severe, we need an equally sudden and severe response. UBI is a good possibility, but I am skeptical that it's a catch-all solution. American society seems to look down upon those who cannot, or choose not, to work. As the labor force shrinks due to automation, this has to change. If you change the culture, policy like UBI will follow. Changing the culture starts with education and compassion.


### Professional Development
#### Cold Outreach

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I co-led a spike on Github workflow. Most of the participants were mod 1 and mod 2 students. I recall how confusing Github was to me not that long ago, so it was cool to be able to help others with something that used to be so intimidating to me.

I paired with my prework guidee several times. I also paired with Eric on APICurious for over an hour. Additionally, I've informally helped numerous people by making myself available in the basement. Hanging out in the pairing room is a good place to help others. My favorite was helping a mod 1 front end student on a JavaScript project earlier in the module.

### Feedback to Others

* Anthony
  * Positive: You're a super hard worker and really fun to work with. I feel like we tackled problems in a truly collaborative manner. I never felt left behind, nor did it ever feel like I was doing an unfair amount of work. We both worked hard and built a thing.
  * Constructive: You sometimes seem less engaged when you're not driving. Work to stay just as engaged whether you're driving or not.

* Joey
  * Positive: You're laid back and easy to work with, yet you get things done.
  * Constructive: Work to verbalize your thought process. Don't take anything for granted when working with other juniors who may not be up to speed.

* Ali
  * Positive: You're always happy to answer questions. You explain your thought process super clearly, and I learned a lot from pairing with you.
  * Constructive: Don't be afraid to be more assertive. I think taking a project manager role would be a good challenge, and I bet you'd be really good at it.

------------------
