# Brad Green - M1 Portfolio  

## Areas of Emphasis

I sought to obtain a strong understanding of basic Ruby syntax, data structures, and logical thinking. I wanted to push myself to work harder than I've ever worked and set a strong precedent for future modules. In addition, I sought opportunities to break outside of my comfort zone and engage with other students in my cohort.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

*Assessed by Beth Sebian*

##### Notes:

* Moved quickly through test implementations
* Some unnecessary Ruby (`Hash.new(0)`) for `cookbook` when no default value needed. Minor issue.
* Great talking through process, reading errors, debugging

##### Ruby Syntax & API
**4:** Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

##### Completion and Progress
**3:** Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

##### Testing
**3:** Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

##### Workflow
**3:** Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### Collaboration
**4:** Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

##### Enumerable & Collections
**3:** Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Intro

I believe I made great progress from the first project (Date Night) to the last (Event Reporter). My understanding of class/module and method relationships grew enough between projects to make Event Reporter a success. I grew comfortable working with multiple classes and large data files and have a much greater grasp of TDD as well as abstracting large methods into smaller, more concise methods.

### Project #1 - Date Night

*Assessed by Beth Sebian*

#### Notes:
* Repo here: https://github.com/bradgreen3/binary_search_tree
* Strong implementation of basic features, with some gaps still causing crashes
* Ruby style and syntax shows understanding of principles
* Insert still under development (hence 1 in functionality): adds nodes, doesn't return depth
* Lots of good learning behind existing functionality
* LOVE that the node is handling creation of links

#### Scores:

##### Functional Expectations
 **1:** Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### Test-Driven Development
 **2:** Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
 **3:** Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style
 **2:**  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

##### Looping *or* Recursion
 **2:** Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately

### Project #2 - Event Reporter

*Assessed by Mike Dao*

##### Notes:
* 21 tests all pass
* There are some good efforts at organization
* Look at the load class and think about what belongs where from top level perspective.
* Some gnarly conditional statements - break them up into logical chunks for clarity
* Pull out messages to their own methods
* Think about where decisions should be made.

#### Functional Expectations

**3:** Application fulfills all base expectations

#### REPL Interface

**3:** Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

#### Test-Driven Development

**2:** Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### Breaking Logic into Components

**3:** Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

**3:**  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Enumerable & Collections

**3:** Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

#### HTML and Style

**4:** Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Intro

I consider both group projects quite successful. In both instances, DTRs greatly improved communication and workflow. In the first project, I discovered many things that I need from a partnership. I also gained a greater awareness of what others may need from me. A greater understanding of what I need, how to ask for it, and how to ensure my partner is receving what they need will undoubtedly lead to even more successful project pairings in the future.

#### Project #1 - Enigma

*Assessed by Mark*

Notes

* 19 tests, 27 assertions, 100% test coverage
* good separation of responsibilities
* encrypt & decrypt methods live in enigma, but its still a lean class
* could've refactored out the duplicated code in
* encrypt/decrypt methods

##### Overall Functionality

**4:** Application follows the complete spec and one extension

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

**3:** Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### Test-Driven Development

**4:** Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

##### Breaking Logic into Components

**3:** Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Project #2 - Headcount

*Assessed by Mark*

Notes:

* Repo: https://github.com/meganft/headcount
* test suite - 48 tests, 57 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97%
* test harness - 1 error, 1 failure
* uses #each a lot where there are better choices for enumerables
* generally good separation of responsibilities, but some refactoring could still be used
* some repetition, but 3am sucks

##### Functional Expectations

**3:** Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6

##### Test-Driven Development

**3:** Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

**3:** Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

**3:** Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Enumerable & Collections

**3:** Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

##### Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

**4:** Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Intro

Throughout the module, I attended a number of Gear Up sessions and professional development workshops. I felt that these provided me an opportunity to explore ways to become a better team member and overall human being.

### Gear Up

#### CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap.
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

I am a strong supporter of breaking down gender barriers and moving our society toward equality for women and minorities. This Gear Up helped me apply my belief system into my future field: technology. My awareness of issues facing women in technology has been heightened, and I will seek ways in which I can help further the cause.

#### There is an "I" in "Team"
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown

This Gear Up was interesting to me for a variety of reasons, but the most intersting part might have been observing others' reactions to it. Even for those who seemed hesitant to "discuss their feelings", I noticed a general opening up as people began discussing positive team experiences that they've been a part of. My group practiced going around in a circle and making sure one's response addressed the previous person's comments. It was amazing to see how validation can make people feel heard and respected, even if that validation was a forced part of a team-building exercise.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

I like to focus on mastering a few tasks at a time rather than scratching the surface of tens of hundreds of tasks, but that's not always reasonable. Nevertheless, I think I need to allow myself to do what comes naturally and allow my attention to be directed primarily into 2 or 3 areas. That's not to say I'll abandon other tasks, but I need to efficiently manage my cognitive load.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Learning How to Pair

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md
https://github.com/bradgreen3/enigma/blob/master/DTRGuidingQuestionsMemoTemplate.txt

I really enjoy doing a DTR. Whether it seems tedious or not, I whole-heartedly believe in doing a DTR before any significant project. The better one gets at asking for what they need, the more effective a DTR becomes. Each time I do it, the better I get at it, and I'd imagine the same is true for others. Making individual needs known and acknowledging others isn't just good for projects; it's good for all relationships.

#### Personal Branding (part 1)
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md
(Resume due second week of module 2)

There were lots of good nuggets of information in this session. For example, on a resume, explain why I opted for a career change, but do it in a positive light. Don't list education first because it's not what I do/who I am. Place a strong emphasis on projects and experience. I'm convinced I need to start thinking about a professional social media presence. I had never considered getting a Twitter account for professional reasons (I don't even have a personal Twitter account).

#### Personal Branding (part 2)
https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p2.md

Although I'm not currently comfortable with the technical aspect of building a website, I feel like I have a good idea what it'll look like once I do. On a professional website, it's important to avoid repepetive "I" statements, feel free to list things that I'm passionate about, avoid linking off site, and avoid flowery language. Design my website with a non-developer in mind because that is who is likely to first visit.

#### StrengthsFinder

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YX4TpaymbmaPJctdIRkMF7OVxXPkpGyaIqL6Qr_xVz8/edit

This session was very interesting. I struggle to acknowledge my strengths, especially to others. I know this is an important skill to have when it comes to gaining employment, so I appreciate the practice. It also helps my confidence and self esteem to put a positive spin on my personal attributes.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Lee: I really appreciate how thorough our DTR was. I can tell that you took it really seriously, and it paid off big time. For a first pair project, I thought it went about as well as it could. I really appreciate your patience with me asking for help/explanations. It was awesome how cordial all of our interactions were. Thank you for making that pair project so enjoyable. My only advice would be to exercise caution when doing a lot of individual work/research. If your partner isn't a divide-and-conquer type, then I'd recommend a lot of time together in the planning stages of a project in order to make sure you're both on the same page with the general design elements.

To Megan: I appreciate that we did a DTR and established the ways in which we best work together. It seems as though neither of us are divide-and-conquer types, so I'm glad that we established as much and were able to find times to work together in person. You're extremely dedicated and hard-working, and I really enjoyed working with you on this project. As for advice, I'd just be careful that frustration over code doesn't inadvertenly get directed at your partner. At times I felt like I was upsetting you, but I think it was just general frustration with the project, which is completely normal.

### Being a Community Member

From Lee: Had a good pairing with you on Enigma. You're really easy to get along with and have a very calming presence. One area you might work on is being more assertive. I really enjoyed our time working together!

From Megan: Brad was a very good partner. We established our team dynamic early, and I think we were able to stick to it. The project was very challenging, but I believe we were well matched. If I can give any advice, I would say Brad needs to work on expressing his thought process aloud rather than thinking to himself. It was very hard to tell what he was thinking because he tends to process inwardly first. This made it hard for me as a partner, because I ended up feeling silly asking the questions so often and having to push for that conversation. Other than that, good work!

From Robbie: Brad and I paired up a bit during Event Reporter. Pairing with Brad was very easy to do, and it is always nice work with someone who is humble and kind. I think that Brad's demeanor is something to be valued. I was trying to think of more eloquent way to put this, but I haven't been able to. So, with that said, it was just nice to be around someone with his characteristics. It made the brainstorming and working process easier.

### Playing a Part

I'm a quiet person, and the social requirements of Turing have occasionally been a challenge. That said, I've pushed myself to approach others, check in on how they're doing, look at their code, go get coffee, chat on the train ride home, etc. I am not much of a talker, but I'm a good listener. In future mods, I will become even more involved in social outlets, but I feel good about my efforts thus far. I'm finding a healthy balance that I'll need to keep checking on in order to maintain.
