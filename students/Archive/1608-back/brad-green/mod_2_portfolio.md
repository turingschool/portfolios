# Brad Green - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module 2, I hoped to gain a strong understanding of Ruby on Rails basics. By the end of the module, I hoped to have the ability to build a basic web application from scratch. I also hoped to gain a strong conceptual understanding of more advanced Rails techniques and the resources available to help me apply them to future applications. On a more personal level, I wanted to become more accepting of my struggles. I wanted to get over myself and reach out for help more often in order to overcome adversity.

*Evaluated Projects:*
###### Rush Hour
Repo: https://github.com/bradgreen3/rush-hour-skeleton <br>
Scores: https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1608-b/2module/rush_hour/daniel_brad_anthony.md

What I learned/took away from project: <br>
In hindsight, this project helped me gain a better understanding of MVC architecture and RESTful routes. How? We had to build them all by hand. Rails can generate routes for you, Sinatra doesn't. I realize how much I take for granted when working in Rails. For example, as far as I know, link helpers are a thing in Rails, whereas they aren't in Sinatra--You have to know full URI patterns. This was also our first group project, so I learned that it takes a different level of assertiveness to contribute within a group project than in a pair.

###### Job Tracker
Repo: https://github.com/bradgreen3/job-trackerScores/Eval <br>
Scores: https://github.com/bradgreen3/job-tracker/pull/1 <br>

What I learned/took away from project: <br>
This project was about solidifying the basics of CRUD and writing model methods. I worked really hard on this project and did not take any time off that weekend. If I did this project today, I'm confident it'd be so much better than it was then. I've learned a lot, and that's a good feeling. Looking back, I find it funny that I
called model methods in my views. Compared to then, I also realize that I have a much stronger commitment to sad path tests in my projects.


###### Little Shop
https://github.com/mscherer11/i-shop-beer <br><br>
What I learned/took away from project: <br>
This project has really started to help me put everything together. By this point, I feel fairly comfortable with the foundations of SQL databases/relationships and CRUD functionality. With the help of the others in my group, we were able to apply newer concepts such as slugs, authentication/authorization, admin privilege, and name spacing, and enums. I've also been more involved in Git workflow and creating and assigning Waffle.io cards.

*Non-evaluated Projects:*

###### Idea Box
https://github.com/bradgreen3/idea-box <br> <br>
What I learned/took away from project: <br> This project helped me get familiar with sessions, flash messages, and name spacing. In this project, I didn't feel super confident with these techniques, but I feel that my understanding is increasing the more I work on applying them in Little Shop.


###### MixMaster
https://github.com/bradgreen3/mix_master <br> <br>
What I learned/took away from project: <br>
As I write this (weekend before week 6), I realize how much I've learned since the beginning of the module. As I look back through this project's tutorial, I can easily recall how foreign it all seemed to me the first time I went through it. Now, I feel confident that I could build this project without the tutorial's help. The only exception may be Factory Girl. Using it is still a bit fuzzy. I like this tutorial's emphasis on TDD. In building Rails apps, especially as a beginner, writing good tests is imperative. They help create a strong conceptualization of how the app will work and gives a guide for implementing functionality.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

It's very difficult to quantify resilience. I like the ideas discussed in this Gear Up, but I'm not sure that they relate to resilience, whatever that may be. Yes, we have the ability to change our perspective on life events. Doing so can greatly improve our happiness and success in life; however, in more challenging situations such as personal loss or trauma, this is much easier said than done. My biggest takeaway from this session is an increased desire to learn just what resilience is. At this point, I tend to agree with the optional article. "It’s (resilience) not just the strength to stay the course but to question it and propose others, not just to survive but to thrive."

#### Introvert/Extrovert

I had already seen this TED talk and read Susan Cain's book "Quiet", so the more informative portion of this Gear Up was the discussion. My biggest takeaway was the lack of understanding people on opposite sides of the introvert/extrovert spectrum have for each other. It's difficult to be considerate of the other side's needs when they seem so foreign to you. It's not out of a lack of respect, but just a lack of understanding and societal expectation that we all follow an extrovert model. I'm glad we had this topic for a Gear Up. Toward the end of our discussion, one extroverted member of my group paused for a bit before remarking that Turing must be exhausting for introverts. Yes, yes it is. Even if you took the academic difficulty out of the equation, it'd still be beyond exhausting for us.

#### Vote Your Conscience

Although I have voted in every single election since turning 18, this Gear Up furthered my understanding of the importance of voting. Instead of viewing voting as a right, it probably should be viewed as a responsibility. Citizens should be well-informed and engaged, otherwise our democracy will be susceptible to more and more corruption.

#### Reflection

a) Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well? <br> <br>
In Rush Hour, we used Github, but we all worked together and always pushed to master. This prevented Github disasters, but it also meant that I didn't learn much about Github workflow from this project. We used Waffle.io, but I wasn't very involved in the Waffle process. In Little Shop, we used Waffle.io, and I was MUCH more involved in creating and assigning waffle cards. We also figured out how to integrate Waffle cards with Github issues. We are checking out Github branches for each feature and resolving merge conflicts like seasoned pros. Ok, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like I'm learning a lot about Git workflow from this project.

b) How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process. <br> <br>
In Rush Hour, the constructive feedback was mostly about being more assertive. I've gotten this feedback throughout my life, but I'm starting to see it in a new light. Being assertive doesn't necessarily mean that I know what to do and take charge. It may mean that when I'm confused about something, I speak up and ask for an explanation. Assertiveness is not always knowing the right answer. In many situations, it may just mean speaking up, whether I know the right answer or not. It's about ensuring my needs are known.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*Rush Hour:*

From Brad to Anthony: Positive--Calm, level headed with good solutions. Constructive--When you have a comment about code, explain the code more clearly.

From Brad to Daniel: Positive--Appreciated when Daniel answers questions when there's confusion. Constructive--You can get fixated on a single solution which sometimes prevents us from exploring other solutions.

### Being a Community Member

*Rush Hour:*

From Daniel to Brad: Positive--do have solutions & good comments. Constructive--be more assertive

From Anthony to Brad: Positive--level headed, fun, contributed bits and pieces when we could. Constructive--be more assertive.

### Playing a Part

###### Prework Guide

I've enjoyed working with Andrew Wooten, an incoming mod 1 student, on his prework. I've given detailed advice on the work that he's submitted thus far, and have reached out to him to make sure he's keeping up with the work. My prework guide wasn't the most communicative, so I'm glad that I'm able to be a good resource for Andrew.

###### Posse

I went to quite a few Verou meetings. I enjoyed getting exposure to more advanced CSS organizational techniques, Bootstrap tips, and cool things you can do with D3. I wish I had the time to explore these things in greater depth, but it's nice to know they're out there.
