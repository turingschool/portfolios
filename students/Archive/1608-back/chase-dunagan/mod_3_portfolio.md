# Chase Dunagan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod, I wanted to improve on my projects from last mod.  In repeating mod 3, I wanted to make sure I understood API's better, and I also wanted to try more things individually.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These are the group projects that I completed in Module 3.

### Rails Engine

Notes from Lauren

-Great use of scopes, worth cleaning up artifacts of pre-scope code
-Integration/unit test left out for pending customers request
-Unit tests are good for relationships, but could use AR query checks
-Boss level query uses two AR calls (no ruby enums though)
-we used spec's definition of pending vs spec harness'
-Formatting in controller should all live in serializer

(Feedback from team)

### From Dan:
Chase was a great partner to work during Cloney Island. Chase definitely has an ability to think critically, and his knowledge of APIs and endpoints helped us move the project along at a quicker pace. Furthermore, Chase helped redirect several things we misunderstood during the project, such as how to use Twilio. For future projects, I think Chase could put in more effort in the final stages of the project, but overall I had a lot of fun working with him.

### From Mike:
Chase was a good partner during Cloney Island.  He was always available to do work, and put in some good hours on the reviews api.  His guidance was important for us during the POST/PUT/etc portion of our api.  One opportunity for Chase is to better communicate his schedule and set expectations accordingly.

### From Joey:
Chase, it was great working with you on rales engine. Overall it was an extremely clean project and I find the simplicity and structure very satisfying. You were really easy to work with and taught me some interesting things about serializers. I appreciate that you refused to look at your previous rales engine. That was crucial for me to learn the material. My only criticism: don’t make me fix your merge conflicts!

(Feedback to team)

### To Dan:
Daniel is the type of programmer that goes all out trying to solve a problem.  He doesn’t give up, and it was great to work with him because of this attribute.  He is an active record and SQL boss, and I think the project would have taken much longer and we would have ran into more speed bumps if Dan had not been in our group.

### To Mike:
Mike was full of great ideas and killed the J-query on our project.  He was always willing to get to work, be it night or day, and I envy him for having that ability. Mike was a crucial part of our project because he wasn’t afraid to take on some of the more difficult aspects of the project.  One constructive criticism of Mike is for him to appear more open to other people’s ideas.  Sometimes it felt like once he had his idea, it would take a lot to change it, which may have stopped me from sharing my ideas once or twice.

### To Brad:
Brad is a great partner to have on a project.  If you tell him to to something or get some piece of functionality done, he will do it.  It was great having a partner who you knew you could trust to get something done.  One criticism of Brad is that he sometimes questions his abilities too much.  Programming is tough, and no one has all the answers, and that’s OK.  We are always going to be in a situation where we are programming with someone who knows more than us, but that shouldn’t stop him from giving his opinions and thoughts, because they were crucial to our success, and it would have sucked to not have them.

### To Joey:
Joey was a great partner to have on Rales Engine.  He gets stuff done, and learns very quickly.  He was great to have discussions with, and convinced me that solving merge conflicts BEFORE I made a PR was the best course of action. Joey’s best quality is that he is great at time management.  He will get his work done, when it needs to be done, but still takes breaks and has a shut off time.  It was very fun working with Joey.

## D: Something valuable I've taken away from my posse

This mod I "joined" the GOlic posse and we basically just watched videos of talks from great programmers throughout the mod.  I was not able to attend every talk, but I did get to see a great Sandy Metz talk, which makes me even more excited that I'm going to meet her in a couple of months!!!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions Group 1

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

This gear up was fun because we got to talk about what types of remarks and phrases were categorized as microagressions.  My eyes were opened up to a lot of things I might have said in the past, that were actually microagressions.

#### Journey Mapping:

* [Github Gist URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This gear up was great because we were able to learn about where some people came from before turing.  It was mostly about the fact that everyone takes different journies to get things accomplished, and how although those journies are different, the end goals are commonly the same.

#### Grit Mindset: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I was not able to do this gear-up because I was ill.
