## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to work as hard as I could this mod, and I wanted to give it my all.  I felt like I did.  I also feel like the end of the mod finally got the best of me.  For the first time at turing, I had a "breakdown", and I honestly am still limping and crawling to the finish line.  I believe I have learned a ton, and want to continue to learn and grow during my job search and I cannot thank Turing and their instructors enough for that they have done for me.  But at this point, I am officially stressed.  I am officially beaten down.  I feel like I've let people down, and I feel like I am just wanting Turing to be over with so I can relax for a day or two in my life with nothing to worry about or extreme deadlines that make me work for 11-12 hours each day with no breaks.

Repo:

Notes:

- Not actually checking password on login
- Filtering needs to be added
- Need to push some logic down from the controller to the model in hot reads
- Need to mark hot and top links on main app links index refresh
- Need to refactor the long prepareHotness method
- Need to test the functionality on Hot Reads
- Need at least feature tests for each section. Possibly multiple tests per section.
- Need documentation on both applications


## Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.
* **2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.**
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.**
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.**
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* **2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.**
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

### 6. Documentation

* 4: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application including a screencast or tutorial
* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application
* 2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
* **1: Project has insufficient documentation**

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* **3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.**
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes from Jeff:

- We cut scope in the previous meeting, but ended with un-started cards and un-finished cards
- App functionality feels a bit "prototype" / rough
- Some calorie totaling
- We pushed off the removing
- Can change dates but not really update the meals and date-related info
- Nice in-place editing of foods and searching of the list
- A few tests in place but not a ton of coverage
- JS syntax is fine
- Would like to see a bit more use of OO-style JavaScript, breaking up functions and responsibilities
- Git looks good
- PMing shows progress but isn't quite clean -- break down stories into smaller pieces, finish them

Scores from Jeff:

Functional Expectations: 2

Testing: 2

HTML/CSS/UI: 3

### LookingFor

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/Lookingfor)
*   [Original Assignment](https://lookingFor.turing.io/)

LookingFor was an app that we worked on for a little over a week where we learned about scrapers and implemented message queues that sent the info the scrapers got, to lookingfor, and eventually tied in that info with the info from Monocle. 

# Notes

* It's running SQL, and stuff, and lots of errors
* Streaming a bunch of fucked up data into Monocle
* So..why are there multiple scrapers running? How could you possibly debug this?
* LookingFor watches a queue, scrapers get jobs and drop them into the queue
* LookingFor finds the company in Monocle or creates a new one
* "Location information isn't passing Travis" - it's still unhappy
* Tracker: not good
* Inherited three scrapers, revised them, built the additional two scrapers
* Sounds like some good technical challenges, but...not convinced any of the scrapers actually work
* Risk: revised the original scrapers
* Proud of: usage of queues
* This project could have been the best of the five today, but as demoed it's basically a more messed
up version of LookingFor than we had a week ago.
* Something about needing to change the Google Maps key


## D: Professional Skills

Turned into Meg

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

In this gear up, we talked about the importance of being around people who are not like you, and also being around people who are like you.  We need a balance, and not just one side or the other. 

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This gear up honestly scared the hell out of me.  It made me envsion a dim and dark future, that hopefully will not come true.  Yes the robots will eventually win and take all of our jobs... I think that's inevitable... but there will still be people who want to be around people and want to be helped by people.  People. That's what life is all about, after all. 

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Universal basic income is a great idea, that in reality would be extremely difficult to maintain and also difficult to deal with the effects it would cause (mass immigration, laziness, not ending poverty, etc).

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


**Feedback for Mike Scherer**
Mike was great to work with.  He is extremely helpful in a group and does not hesitate to take time out from whatever he is doing, to help someone out.  I appreciate Mike for being a good friend and a good partner. 

**Feedback for Lee Saville**
Lee and I had some differences, but at the end of the day, we both wanted to get the work done, we just had drastically different ideas of what working hard were.

**Feedback for Alisher**
I took Mod 1 with Alisher, and he repeated and I moved on.  Working with him in Mod 4, you would have thought it was the exact opposite.  He was a great partner with great ideas and figured things out incredibly fast.

### Being a Community Member

**Feedback from Lee Saville**
You’re a really fun guy to be around and I had some good times with you this mod. If we were to work together again I’d love to see you take more ownership of the work you’re involved with. I really appreciate your effort and I wish you the best.

**Feedback from Alisher**
I have worked with Chase for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He is a great guy to be around and good at collaboration. He has good communication skills and understood what needed to be done and where we were at with the projects

**Feedback from Noah Berman**
It was kind of unfortunate that Chase and I first got to work together on such a high-stress project, but we were able to work well and got quite a lot done considering our lack of JS knowledge. Chase's willingness to dive into new (and by the end increasingly ridiculous) solutions made a very stressful time less agonizing. Thanks for struggling through Quantified Self with me!

### Playing a Part

* I Led a spike on Exercisms, helping multiple students set up, and do a couple of exercisms.

* I helped a pair of students figure out a "Gitasrophy"

* I paired with a mod 2 student on basic rails ideas

* I helped out multiple students with small problems here and there throughout the mod.
