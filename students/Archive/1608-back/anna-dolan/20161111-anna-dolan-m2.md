# Anna Dolan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At my Module 1 portfolio review, Jeff suggested that I be less hard on myself and try to enjoy learning at Turing, so this is one of my primary goals for this module, along with learning the material and accomplishing all assignments and projects. I also hope to be helpful to Module 1 students, because the help I received from other students was important to me last module. I hope to be more active in the community in general.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Following are my individual projects from Module 2 at Turing.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/annadolan/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)
* [Heroku App](https://job-tracker-app.herokuapp.com/)

The goal of this project was to create a personal job tracker app in Rails. This app has CRUD functionality for several models, along with an analysis piece to perform calculations on the data stored in the database and display it on the dashboard.

I enjoyed this project because we finally got to put some of our Rails skills to good use. I was really pleased with how the Bootstrap styling worked out, and excited to have a functional app that someone might actually use.

### Rubric

#### 1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

#### 2) Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

#### 3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view. 

#### 4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

#### 5) Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

#### 6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

#### 7) Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

#### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/annadolan/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)
* [Heroku App](https://thawing-forest-91031.herokuapp.com/playlists)

This ungraded project was a tutorial to introduce us to creating and testing an app in Rails, and pushing it to Heroku.


#### GIF Generator

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/annadolan/gif_generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)
* [Heroku App](https://gif-generator-app.herokuapp.com/)

For this ungraded mini-project in Rails, I chose the GIF generator option. This app allows an admin to create categories and generate GIFs for existing categories using the Giphy API, and a regular user can add existing GIFs to their favorites. My app works well, but needs more testing and plenty of refactoring, especially in the views. Log into the Heroku app as admin with email "blue@blue.blue" and password "password". Log in as a regular user with "email@email.com" and "password."

This project was fun because of the GIF aspect of it. I felt a little held back by the spec, and I didn't really like that a category has to be created before a GIF can be made in that category. Aside from that, I am happy with the outcome, and I also got to hone my Bootstrap skills a little more.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are my group projects from Module 2.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

For this project, we created an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. We simulated the process of gathering and receiving data in a grouping called a payload. This application can accept the submission of these payloads, analyze the data submitted, and display it through a HTML interface.

When we first started the project, I felt a little behind, but was soon brought up to speed by my teammates. After that, I really enjoyed the project. I had a great team and I was proud of what we accomplished.


### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Erin Pintozzi: Anna, working with you on Rush Hour was a great experience. I think we had a lot of great back-and-forth flow which helped our group solve problems throughout the project. I think as we continue to learn more you'll be able to harness that ability to do some of the back-and-forth on your own which will make you a great programmer who gets stuff done. You helped our team produce a great project that I'm excited to show off.

Alisher Sadikov: I really enjoyed working with Anna on the Rush Hour Project. She is very quick at understanding what needs to be completed in a given situation to solve a certain problem.  I also noticed that she is great at not only building the logical pieces of the project, but also at visual things like styling. Throughout the project she had a very positive attitude which made the teamwork easy and enjoyable. I look forward to working with Anna again in the future.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/root_and_branch)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Heroku App](http://root-and-branch.herokuapp.com/)

This app is a mock store called Root & Branch, which is a marketplace for socially responsible goods. It is a fully functioning web store written in Rails, complete with user authentication and admin authorization, a functioning cart and checkout, and Bootstrap styling.

This project was a ton of fun, and I had a great group. We worked hard on the code, testing, refactoring, and styling, and I am really happy to have this app to show people.


## D: Professional Skills
Following are the Gear Up sessions and Professional Development workshops that I have participated in this module.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this session, my group discussed "To Vote or Not to Vote." We disagreed with the premise of much of the reading that was provided, and we talked about the reasons why a person might make the decision not to vote. We concluded that there are a lot of issues with the current election system and that it takes a lot of trust in that system to believe that your vote will matter or result in the outcome that you want to see, and that not using your vote is a valid personal decision.

#### Introversion and Extroversion in Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

In this session, my group talked about whether introversion and extroversion are actually mutually exclusive, or whether they can exist at once in a person. I expressed my opinion that, while introversion and extroversion are real attributes, it is a mistake to define a person as an "introvert" or an "extrovert," as this is a false dichotomy and deliberately avoids learning to work with people on an individual basis. There was some moderate disagreement in our group, but we all could agree that people can display more introversion or extroversion depending on their situation.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

In this session, we discussed the idea of resilience and how it relates to our experience at Turing. My group discussed how we felt we learned resilience in module 1, because it was so stressful and demanding. We talked about other experiences we had had that either built or called for resilience. We also discussed how we felt that other people's tragedies should not be seen as "opportunities for growth", and that framing an experience in this way should only be done by the person experiencing it. This was an interesting discussion, especially as this was an idea I've been thinking a lot about lately, especially when it comes to overcoming personal worries and fears.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw-jHUaCy9fiRnZUTHFMMW5iRWM/view?usp=sharing)

In this session, Lia introduced us to some tools for finding companies we are interested in working for, and for making connections at these companies. She gave us some alternatives to applying to online job listings and some helpful information for making connections.


#### Cold Outreach

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tc5prHnsV0wfkxi4z8mvVvdbqG715Bd_anaOSLNd18k/edit?usp=sharing)

This session was dedicated to writing cold emails to people we found following the "Finding Opportunites" session. Meg went through emails we wrote as an exercise and critiqued them. This was helpful in getting us comfortable writing these emails, although it still feels strange to me. I have linked to my first attempt at a cold email as a deliverable.

#### Collaborative Communication

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw-jHUaCy9fiU3NYV1hQTll4VGM/view?usp=sharing)

In this session, we were introduced to Agile development, and encouraged to think about our role in a team. Following this discussion, my team had our DTR discussion. Our discussion outline is linked to as a deliverable.

#### Revisiting Feedback

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PUyJRkvUZzFgZbDG3ciYEJzQjcFgS8xhHcqZIOJ_Vhk/edit?usp=sharing)

In this session, Allison had us reflect on past group work and feedback that we had received from teammates. We discussed blind spots, which was a helpful way to put ourselves in someone else's position and think about what might be motivating their behavior. My reflection after this session is linked to as the deliverable.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Alisher Sadikov - Alisher was one of my teammates on Rush Hour, and we worked together very successfully. He was helpful when I was lost early on in the project, and made sure that we didn't move on until I caught up. We spent long hours working as a group, and Alisher's pleasant and calm attitude contributed greatly to the group dynamic. Working with Alisher was absolutely a pleasure. I hope that we will get another chance to work together on a team.

Erin Pintozzi (Rush Hour) - Erin was the Project Manager for my Rush Hour group, and she contributed enormously to the success of our project. Erin made sure that our team stayed on constant communication throughout the project, and kept us on track using Waffle. She also had a large part in the productive and happy group dynamic that we were able to maintain throughout the project. I look forward to continuing to work with her on future projects.

Erin Pintozzi (Little Shop) - Erin was in my Little Shop group, and acted as the Project Manager. She kept us organized and on task, while at the same time being very open to ideas presented by group members. She worked very hard to keep us organized on Waffle while also putting in a ton of work on our code. I have worked with Erin twice this module, and I think that a presence like hers is very important to productivity and general happiness in a group-work scenario.

Megan Talbot - Megan and I worked together on Little Shop this module. Megan is a hard worker and a great collaborator. She and I paired for most of the project, and we were able to get a lot of work done together. She is good at offering her opinion in a kind way, and is open to others' ideas. I look forward to workin with her in future modules on both group and individual projects.

Ali Schlereth - Ali was a part of my Little Shop group this module, and this was my first time working in a group with her. Ali was very dedicated to the project and excited at small victories. She helped to keep us motivated and contributed to a happy group dynamic. She also put in a ton of work on the project, and made really important contributions to our code. I look forward to working with her in the future, whether in a group or on an individual project.

Jean Joeris - This module I got to know Jean through joining the Armstrong posse and attending posse meetings and spikes. Jean is an excellent teacher, and worked very hard to present difficult concepts to a group of people with mixed experience. I really enjoyed being in Armstrong this module, and I hope to continue to work with & learn from Jean next module as well.

### Being a Community Member

Megan Talbot - Anna was an awesome partner. We worked together on our Little Shop project, and we paired together for most of our work. I am very pleased with how much we were able to get done. Anna is a really hard worker and I always appreciated how much she was willing to do! I know we will continue to support each other in future modules, and I look forward to those opportunities. 

Erin Pintozzi - Anna, it was really exciting the be able to work with you a second time this mod. I am so glad you took the lead as our product designer. Our Little Shop looks awesome and you rock at styling. I also think it's pretty cool to see how much more confident in the MVC type framework you've become for solving problems, debugging, and testing. I think you're going to keep rocking these skills as we continue to learn more.

Ali Schlereth - Anna has a lot of passion for design and usability. She is quick to pick up on ideas and strategies and is comfortable aggregtaing research to come up with solutions. I've enjoyed learning from her this module and know she is a good resource for collaboration. Thanks for a great working dynamic!

### Playing a Part

This module I felt less stressed than I did in Mod 1, so I have been trying to spend more time taking part in the community at Turing. I joined the Armstrong posse, and I have been enjoying posse meetings and getting to know the other members. My posse sparked an interest in machine learning and A.I., which gave me the idea for my lightning talk and my technical blog this module.

I also really looked forward to pairing with Mod 1 students, which I have done several times but not as much as I had wanted to, partially because their materials differ so greatly from what my cohort learned in Mod 1. I have also been much more comfortable in my cohort this module, and I have really been enjoying working and spending time with my classmates. I have participated enthusiastically in all of the Gear Up sessions and cohort retros, and I have continued to arrive early each day to Turing to spend time with other students.
