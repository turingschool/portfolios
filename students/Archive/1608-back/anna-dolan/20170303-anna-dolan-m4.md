# Anna Dolan - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I want to finish strong at Turing. I am really proud of what I have accomplished so far, and I've fought through a lot of stress and self-doubt to get here. My goal is to be proud of the projects that I work on this module, and to come out confident and job-ready. I want to be as supportive to my cohort as possible, and I want to continue to support them after graduation.

For this project, we were required to contribute to an open source project and write a blog detailing the process. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are the group projects I worked on this module.

### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/annadolan/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified self is a calorie tracker app that allows the user to monitor calories consumed and burned throughout the day. In this application, we worked with Javascript and jQuery for the first time, and practiced persisting large amounts of data in browser storage.

Assessed By: Nate

#### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application has all functionality built, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

#### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.
- **2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type**
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

#### HTML/CSS/UI

- **4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes**
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

#### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

#### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**
- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

#### Project Management

- **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories**
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them

Jon Kimble: "Anna it was great working with you on Quantified Self, I'm so glad we got the opportunity to work on two projects together before the end of Turing! You have always been a hard worker willing to take on any challenges and do what is best for the team.  No matter how much you have on your plate, whenever I've come to you with problems, you've been happy to pair for a bit to figure it out which I really appretiate! If there was one thing I think you could improve upon it would be stress managment, you seem to have things like running and climbing that work well for you outside of school but developing some ritual which can realiably defuse some of the stress at school might be helpful. Stress management techniques have helped me alot in the past and I would be happy to chat about it any time :).  It was great working with you and I know if we ever get assigned to a group again then code is about to be crushed!"

Noah Berman: "Anna and I have a track record of working on capital-p Projects together - first "Headcount" at the end of mod1, now our Capstone Project/s at the end of mod4. I'm glad we got to work together again and especially on this project! She writes great code and her tenacity when problem solving has always been a major asset. When we found out that Joust (our secondary project) would need to pull data from Code of Arms she volunteered to create an API for us, went home, and then the next day we had an API. Skillz. Has been great working with Anna throughout the mod, I'm sure she's gonna do great things in the post-Turing world!"

Nick Martinez: "It was a pleasure working with you on Code of Arms and Joust (sick names by the way). The chemistry of our team was great even through some of the most stressful work in our seven months. The only critical feedback I can give you is, in the words of Erin, "Everything is going to be ok." It will. Your dedication to projects even through the stress is admirable and I wish I could match your desire to be successful."

Erin Pintozzi: "This is my fifth project with Anna while here at Turing. It's been an interesting experience to be able to grow and learn together over the last 7 months in a much deeper capacity than most of my other peers. Anna is smart and confident and can solve any problem. Even when she gets frustrated, she's so good at using that energy to find answers and not give up. She arguably holds herself to a higher standard than anyone else I've paired with during my time here at Turing and whoever she works with in the future will be lucky to have her on their team."

### Joust

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/joust)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/secondary)

An application that uses the Ripped API to pit students' solutions to code challenges against each other.

#### Notes from Instructors
#### Jeff: 
* Problem: too much free time, opportunity to hone skills, be better developers
* Get two solutions from the same exercise on Code of Arms
* PLEASE DON'T TYPE "LKHJGSDFG" IN YOUR DEMOS!
* Tracker: good progress, some stories in the backlog, add some filtering
* Shame: Showing Sal a thing that didn't work, turned out to just have Pry
* Proud: use of the Code of Arms API, neat to build other things
* Improved the CoA API to allow the functionality
* "How do you see the comments?" "`rails c`"

#### Nate:
- I like the consistent style with code of arms
- It seems like a good start, but a lot of the "sticky" functionality is yet to come

## D: Professional Skills
Following are the professional development and Gear Up sessions I attended this module.

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

For this Gear up, we discussed how actively seeking out diversity can be helpful, specifically when hiring for or seeking a job. We looked at "Parable of the Polygons", which quantified how small efforts can pay off, or how minor discomfort with people who are not the same as you can cause segregation and deep divisions in society. It was interesting to see how a large number of small personal efforts can make a great difference in how society operates.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

In this session, we looked at the present and future of automation, and discussed the potential fallout from more jobs becoming automated. We did not come to any happy conclusions about this, and the overwhelming conclusion was that Universal Basic Income will become a necessity. There also seemed to be a feeling that as developers, we'd be safe from automation, and I don't believe that to be true.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In this session, we continued to discuss the repercussions of automation, and the possibility of the need for a universal basic income. My group talked about whether or not this was a likely option, and how to get information to people about this possibility. We didn't come to any solid conclusion, but none of us felt very hopeful about it.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Module 4 StrengthsFinder: What's next?

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/strengths_finder/mod4_strengthsfinder_small_group.md)
*   Deliverables n/a

In this session, we tried to imagine where we hoped to be in one year, and made a plan to take steps toward that ending. The steps I came up with were: research companies with possibilities of remote work and with locations near the mountains & find out what they are looking for in employees,  search for mentors who work remotely and cold outreach contacts who work for companies in the locations I’m interested in,.

#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up: Overcoming Job Searching Impostor's Syndrome

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)
*   Deliverables n/a

It was helpful to see that other people have the same worries about the job hunt that I do, and it was pleasant to discuss these worries in a small group. We made plans to meet after Turing is over and work on continued learning together.

#### Interviews with Ingrid Alongi

*   URL n/a
*   Deliverables n/a

Ingrid and Jeff's conversation was really helpful and I took a lot away from this session. I learned a ton of questions to take with me to interviews, and Ingrid helped to shed light on some red flags for companies we should avoid. I took down a lot of notes and I plan to use them.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
Noah Berman: Code of Arms was my second project with Noah, although we hadn't worked together since mod 1. He was able to write a lot of great code while adding a lot of humor and camaraderie to the group. He was always available to vent to when I was frustrated, and is generally very supportive to others. With his creativity and code skills combined, I know Noah is going to make some amazing things after Turing.

Erin Pintozzi: Code of Arms was one of many projects I've worked on with Erin, and I was excited to be in a group with her again. As always, she contributed a ton of great code, along with skillful project management (even though she wasn't technically our PM). She was always very understanding and flexible with group members, and it helped to keep the tone pleasant and upbeat. Erin is really talented, and I am excited to see what she accomplishes after Turing!

Nick Martinez: This module's capstone project was my first time working with Nick at Turing. It was a great experience! Nick added a lot of energy and motivation to our group, and was excited to work on new things. He brought a lot of ideas and was always encouraging and great to work with. I can't wait to see what he does in the future, whether it be in a DevOps role or in another capacity.

Jon Kimble: I was lucky enough to work with Jon for the second time on Quantified Self. This was a very stressful project that definitely could have caused a lot of problems between some pairs, but thanks to Jon's calm and pleasant presence, we managed to get along well throughout the project. Jon also plowed through a lot of really tough code and did a great job. He did sometimes disappear and it would become really tough to communicate or to know where we were at on the project, but once we got on the same page, everything really came together. We won't work together at Turing again, but hopefully one day we will get a chance to in a different capacity!

### Playing a Part

This module, I tried to take as much time as I could to participate in the Turing community. I helped lead two spikes for lower mods, including one on Git workflow and one on exercism. I briefly paired with students from lower mods several times (Charlotte in mod 2 on Rspec testing and Beth in mod 1 on Git), and I made a significant contribution to a project by helping Annie Wolff in mod 3 and her Cloney Island group go back to her Pinterest clone and get the jQuery Masonry library set up properly. I participated in the Turing Lab posse again this module, and enjoyed it a lot. I continued to support and be supported by my cohort. It will be very tough to leave this community.

------------------

## Final Review



### Notes

This is a strong portfolio. I really liked what you chose to do for your OSS contribution, and the dialogue in your PR is pretty fantastic. Surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly, working on PRs like this one of the ways that you can network yourself into a job. You've done good work this module, and during your entire time at Turing. Remember that you are better at this than you think you are.


### Outcome
