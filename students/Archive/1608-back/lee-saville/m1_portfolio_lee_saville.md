# Lee Saville - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into the module seeking to learn about ruby, building a strong base from which I can continue to learn and achieve in the coming modules. In addition I wanted to gather skills along the way that enable me to learn more in the future.

###### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabrosaurus/binary_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date night is an exploration of the binary search tree under the premise that we give a film title a rating and it situates itself in an ordered binary tree. From the tree you can search for and return titles and ratings.

Comments:
* Repo: https://github.com/sabrosaurus/binary_tree
* Test coverage is good for what's been finished
* Not full functionality
* Could use more time breaking functionality into smaller methods

Evaluation Scores:
 1. Functional Expectations: 1 <br>
 Application is missing more than one base expectation

 2. Test-Driven Development: 3 <br>
Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 2 <br>
Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2 <br>
Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


5. Looping *or* Recursion: 3
Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


##### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabrosaurus/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event reporter is a command line application that allows the user to interact with data from an interactive interface. One can load data from a csv file, search the file by name or attribute, and save the search results to a new csv or export into an html file. Additionally, if the number of search items is under 10, one can ask for district information gotten via the sunlight foundation's congress API.

Assessed by: Mark

Comments:

Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

6. Enumerable & Collections: 4 <br>
Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


7. HTML and Style: 4 <br>
Uses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I hadn't previously worked in a group setting for quite some time. These projects gave me the opportunity for practicing the common industry activity of pairing and a chance for getting to know myself on a deeper level.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bradgreen3/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma is a command line application that models its function off the original Enigma machine created at Bletchley Park. It encrypts and decrypts messages based on a generated key and a given date (if no date is given, today's date is used). Additionally we got our first taste of reading from and writing to files.

Assessed By: Mark

Comments:

* 19 tests, 27 assertions, 100% test coverage
* good separation of responsibilities
* encrypt & decrypt methods live in enigma, but its still a lean class
* couldve refactored out the duplicated code in encrypt/decrypt methods

Evaluation Scores:

1. Overall Functionality: 4 <br>
Application follows the complete spec and one extension

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3 <br>
Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development: 4 <br>
Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3 <br>
Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sabrosaurus/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Headcount is a project that utilizes datasets available from the Annie E. Casey foundation to analyze potential relationships between certain statistics. The project highlights this by drawing conclusions between two datasets (i.e. kindergarten participation vs. high school graduation). The project requires us to exercise our abilities in terms of data volume and project size by using object oriented design

Assessed by: Beth

Comments:
* One test on spec harness not passing, not accounting for edge case
* Nice separation of method and class responsibilities
* Obvious strong effort toward refactoring -- with some small exception, Ruby syntax and style very strong (high 3)
* Consistently best choice enumerables

Evaluation Scores:

1. Functional Expectations: 2 <br>
Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

2. Test-Driven Development: 3 <br>
Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3 <br>
Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3 <br>
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections: 4 <br>
Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation: 4 <br>
Zero complaints



### Group Project Takeaways: <br>

I had never supposed myself to be the sort to take charge and drive things forward. Under the pressure of deadlines and the desire to complete the projects I learned more about this previously hidden aspect of myself that I will keep in my awareness and leverage positively in the future to help keep momentum in future projects and in life in general.

## D: Professional Skills
Professional skills are important for our future job prospects. We were just given a mere taste of the professional skills we will continue to develop throughout our time at Turing, and although I devoted limited time directly to enriching this aspect of myself in module 1, I'm eager to take my small beginnings and expand.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

Takeaways: <br>

I really felt excited about the Kathy Sierra talk in which she was outlining how the difficulty of a task is related to cognitive leak. The exciting part was that you should be able to get the super hard tasks to the mindless automation in a quick fashion. She outlined some scenarios in which an expert looks over your shoulder and tells you the answer as the key to learning difficult tasks. I feel that these scenarios sound great in theory but in practice she gave us nothing actionable.

The article by Ta-Nehisi Coates seemed like a more realistic take on coming up against a difficult mental situation, and one that hit home from my experience at Turing. He speaks to the idea of sticking with it even when stuff isn't making sense. His approach was more applicable to our lives at Turing. Keep striving, and learn to enjoy the uncomfortable.



#### There Is An I In Team
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

Takeaways:

I was unsure of the direction of this edition of Gear-Up when our group started out with the somewhat controversial topic of believing in ghosts. Eventually my somewhat reluctant group begin to talk about meaningful things and one of the unifying themes of a later prompt was that people all had really meaningful team experiences when everyone showed up and did their part, even if it was an unpleasant task.

This applies directly to the idea of "drinking the kool-aid" at Turing in order to have the most meaningful experience, even if the job is messy and very human problem intensive.

Again awareness was brought to the forefront in practicing communicating with our cohort-mates in a way that can both be respectful, yet possibly dissenting.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Takeaways:

As a white male I have the privileged position of not even thinking about issues such as these for most of the time. I'm glad it was brought up in such an explicit way, as it brought things to my attention that are daily struggles for other members of our community.

Awareness and attention seem to be the key takeaways of the Turing experience and it is true in this case as well. We can all work to better treat/accommodate members of our community(at turing and in our lives outside turing) that are different from us.

I was really alarmed at the overt hatred experienced by the developer at github.  

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

* Deliverables: <br>
I spent time changing the profile photos from default avatars to my Turing school photo on [GitHub](https://github.com/sabrosaurus) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-saville?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic) as
* Takeaways: <br>
Lia impressed upon us the importance of personal branding as it relates to our success in a career deeply embedded in web culture. Part of this involves cultivating an online presence that is unified and well thought through, as it is a principle channel through which we might make connections. I knew much of the general idea but Lia brought up a lot of specifics and gave us some great guidelines to follow, such as never labelling ourselves as "junior" developers. Another item was to make sure to spin things positively. The idea of using Twitter as a research resource was really great. Overall it seems that Networking is going to be a hug factor in our success.

#### Personal Branding Part 2
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)

* Takeways: <br>
The importance of crafting our face to the world with viewer in mind. In the code saturated world of student life at Turing school we forget that that first contact we may have with a future employer will be through a non-technical viewer. We need to have varying levels of specificity in each of the elements we present to the world. This hierarchy goes from a high overview level in a resume down to more detail on LinkedIn followed by the most personal presentation happening on our personal sites and blogs.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member
#### Feedback from me:

Brandon Randall: <br>
You're a great guy and I hope you succeed in the future. One suggestion would be to hit the basics really hard so that you can tackle the bigger more complex problems that involve knowing the smaller bits more intimately. I felt that during our group work we had to spend a lot of time going over the more basic things. Cheers!

Brad Green: <br>
Hey Brad, had a good pairing with you on Enigma. You're really easy to get along
with and have a very calming presence. One area you might work on is being more
assertive. I really enjoyed our time working together!

Jon Kimble: <br>
Jon, I've pretty much only got positive feed-back for you. I really appreciate
how open you are to helping others. It's not only that willingness but
that what you are offering for advice is grounded in some serious self-study.
What you are saying thus has more weight because you've studied the thing and read
some books and have tried applying what they espouse in your own life. This was first
exhibited when you sent me a large snippet entailing how one might go about rewiring
their likes and dislikes. Another occasion you provided some background on types
of mediation, in full pdf form! I really appreciate the laughs and support!

#### Feedback to me:<br>
Jon Kimble: <br>
What up Lee! It has been awesome being in mod 1 with you. Seeing how hard you work has consistently pushes me to put in the extra hours and go all in on Turing. I've seen huge growth in your coding skills and am confident that you would be a vital member of any team project.  You actively engage in every class and come up with awesome metaphors that help me understand the material!  Your positive attitude towards new coding concepts and your curiosity are real assets to the whole mod.  You have also worked hard to build a community at Turing and I know all of us really appreciate it! If there was one thing you could improve on it would probably be to stress less about the project and just be as focused as possible on implementation.  From my perspective you are killing it, keep up the good work in next mod.

Brad Green: <br>
I really appreciate how thorough our DTR was. I can tell that you took it really seriously, and it paid off big time. For a first pair project, I thought it went about as well as it could. I really appreciate your patience with me asking for help/explanations. It was awesome how cordial all of our interactions were. Thank you for making that pair project so enjoyable. My only advice would be to exercise caution when doing a lot of individual work/research. If your partner isn't a divide-and-conquer type, then I'd recommend a lot of time together in the planning stages of a project in order to make sure you're both on the same page with the general design elements.

Brandon Randall: <br>
Lee is an overall great programmer with the correct attitude needed to solve any problem.
There are several qualities that prove this talent, but the main qualities are maintaining
a calm demeanor at all times, the ability to explain basic coding functions to far less
experienced people and the willingness to take over most of the responsibility in a group
project if needed. These facts prove that he's truly prepared to solve any kind of problem
regardless of how many people are in the project and regardless of any deadlines.

### Playing a Part

The ways I supported the Turing community during this module were subtle and indirect. I showed up everyday and participated in discussions. Apart from this I cultivated several cross cohort relationships, simulating on a miniature scale somewhat informal mentorships. This meant I was always able to reach out for help if I needed (they were also caring enough to check in with me) and ensures in the future my acting in a similar way for future community members, because I experienced its value first-hand.

I tried to answer questions that classmates had on occasion and contributed by cultivating inter-cohort relationships also.

I look forward to participating in more direct ways in the future. One of the possibilities I envision is offering some personal time to pair. Additionally outside the direct Turing community I've offered a hand stuffing bags for the upcoming Rocky Mountain Ruby conference coming up during intermission week.
