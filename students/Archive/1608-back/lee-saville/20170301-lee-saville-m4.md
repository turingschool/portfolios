# Lee Saville - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn javascript and experience the change of perspective a brownfield project provides. Additionally the module has been a rounding out of my experience at Turing and I'm eager to begin the job search in earnest. Contacts and networking were points of focus for me and I was able to reach out and meet numerous people over my module 4 time. This helped me learn more about what opportunities might be available and what I might like to do more specifically. I also set out to practice some interviewing skills and was able to fit in a number of practice/prep interview sessions

* [URLockbox repo](https://github.com/lsaville/final_assessment_urlockbox)<br>
* [URLockbox production](https://calm-fjord-11043.herokuapp.com/links)

Notes:

* Logout/login are ok
* Add a link is ok
* Validation on links is a little shady
* HotReads gets proper read data
* Hot/Top link worked by accident eventually
* Missing JS search
* 22 tests 1 pending
* No documentation
* Implementations are solid

###### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

###### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

###### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

###### 6. Documentation

* 1: Project has insufficient documentation

###### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Module 4 is unique in the fact that it features group projects almost exclusively. The individual work I did related directly to the open source project and some additional scant work in the context of larger group/project work

#### Open Source

Please read my [blog post](https://medium.com/@l.w.saville/my-first-open-source-contribution-b58623133075#.rd6jx8o9n)<br>

My [Bug replication](https://github.com/stympy/faker/issues/828)<br>
My [contribution](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/pull/656) to [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode)<br>
My [documentation patch](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/pull/657)<br>
## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects compose nearly the whole of Module 4 with few exceptions. During our time on the capstone and secondary projects we we worked in the same four person group, mine consisting of Mike, Chase, Alisher and I.

The nature of the projects was a big departure from our normal building the apps from the ground up and we spent most of our time on the primary and secondary projects which were 'brownfield', giving us insight into the nature of real dev work in which you get the chance to adapt or change the work of those that came before you. Each app is a puzzle and your task is to discover how it works and how you can achieve the things you're set to do within that context.

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lsaville/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self represents the only 'greenfield' app of module 4. It also represents our first full immersion into the world of javascript. We created an HTML/CSS only app that relies 100% on js for its functionality. Although difficult it was a fun project and I felt buoyed by the confirmation that I can succeed in/learn another language apart from ruby.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

* Tracker is in good shape
* It actually looks pretty good!
* Functionality appears to work well
* Tests look well structured with some opportunities to isolate repeated functionality / "magic data"
* JavaScript implementation is pretty clean and easy to read/understand

###### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality

###### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

###### HTML/CSS/UI

- 4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes

###### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

###### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

###### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### Monocle

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/monocle)
* [Production](https://monocle.turing.io/)

Monocle was the primary application my group and I worked on this module, for a full four weeks. In these four weeks we adapted or extended the functionality we inherited, driven by a slew of stories on our pivotal tracker. This experience was meant to replicate real life and in many ways it felt as though it did. Our work was split into two two-week sprints.

##### Sprint 1

Reviewer: Jeff

Notes:
* App is usable
* Styling/UX is a bit rough
* Need to deploy to prod & ensure Census prod is ready
* Good progress, good teamwork & load sharing

###### 1. Project Management

* 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

###### 2. Completion & Pace

* 4: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner and laid out future stories.

###### 3. Implementation Quality

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

###### 4. Application of Techniques

* 3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

##### Sprint 2

Members: Mike, Lee, Alisher, Chase

Reviewer: Jeff

Notes:

* Delivered all stories
* Have one small bug card that should be fixed today
* Group is not happy with the JavaScript testing situation -- poltergeist, selenium, saucelabs, etc not that great
* Overall testing isn't great -- 99 tests with 36 pending
* Were able to implement some React components
* Overall working with the existing code and growing/building it went pretty well

###### 1. Project Management

* 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

###### 2. Completion & Pace

* 3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

###### 3. Implementation Quality

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

###### 4. Application of Techniques

* 4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

###### 5. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

#### LookingFor

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/lookingfor)
* [Production](https://lookingfor.turing.io/)

###### Nate:
- Nice dev ops work, before it broke
- Don't put PRY in production
- Cool to see data (companies) actually appearing from your scrapers
- Nice work with queues
- Could do a better job of showing the code. Focus our attention on something. If it needs to be improved, say how.

###### Jeff

* It's running SQL, and stuff, and lots of errors
* Streaming a bunch of fucked up data into Monocle
* So..why are there multiple scrapers running? How could you possibly debug this?
* LookingFor watches a queue, scrapers get jobs and drop them into the queue
* LookingFor finds the company in Monocle or creates a new one
* "Location information isn't passing Travis" - it's still unhappy
* Tracker: not good
* Inherited three scrapers, revised them, built the additional two scrapers
* Sounds like some good technical challenges, but...not convinced any of the scrapers actually work
* Risk: revised the original scrapers
* Proud of: usage of queues
* This project could have been the best of the five today, but as demoed it's basically a more messed
up version of LookingFor than we had a week ago.
* Something about needing to change the Google Maps key

## D: Professional Development

Our professional development this module helped us hone our skills further in the areas of negotiations, overcoming imposter syndrome, and creating job opportunities for ourselves.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Organize Your Shit
This session led by Jeff helped us unify our online presence by ensuring that all our accounts had our name, email, picture, etc. I really appreciated the in class time we were offered to get these things in order. I also appreciate some of the tips about turning notifications off (my phone has been blissfully silent for weeks), and using tools like evernote and the google calendar.

#### Strength's Finder Small Group
[Workshop Url](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/strengths_finder/mod4_strengthsfinder_small_group.md)

In this session we were encouraged to start with our ending first and did several exercises to envision our futures a year from now. This technique seems pretty good and ties into the general philosophy of TDD. Throughout my time at Turing and with all the professional development curriculum and strength's finder I have become more confident with such tasks and can speak to a prompt like that where before I would have struggled. I feel pride at my personal development over the narrative arch.

#### Flower Exercise Follow Up
[Workshop Url](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

This workshop introduced to me the interesting idea that I might be a high-achieving individual, something which I would never presume to think of myself as. This can play into the psychology of the job search and impair a person such as myself from applying to any and all jobs. It's quite easy to talk oneself out of a situation by rationalization. I love Turing's emphasis on goals that are measurable, and the main things I took away from the session is the creation of specific tasks that will make me feel more qualified. Additionally we talked about creating accountability/study groups and continue to meet into module 5.

#### Negotiation
[Workshop Url](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/professional_development/module_four/negotiations.md)

Although you might be a broke student and you're dying for a job, keep your composure and try not to talk directly to the numbers involved in a job (until you get them to say, if possible). It's always really marked how natural Lia sounds when she delivers the nuanced redirection or clarification as compared with how it sounds inside my head. It's nice to hear again some of the clarifying questions that I might forget to add in the heat of the conversational moment.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

###### Jon:
You’ve received positive feedback from me every module and this won’t be any different. Consistently you’re a positive voice that I rely on and although we didn’t get a chance to work together directly this mod I really appreciate our walks around the block and the almost weekly shakedowns. You’re obviously blessed with a high eq and have all the people skills in addition to your burgeoning technical skill-set. You also have great skills in receiving and applying feedback… I remember the difference in your workflow from robo-pies to now and you’ve obviously upped your game! I’m eager to see where we both end up and the things we end up doing. Thanks so much for all your insight! It’s been such a great ride!

###### Alisher:
I really enjoyed all the time we got to spent pairing over the past four weeks. You have a great temperament and awesome dedication to the problem at hand! I don’t really think it’s a flaw, but one thing you could be aware of in the future is your tendency to get fixated on a particular approach to solving a problem and you just keep going until you get it done that way. I feel great about the work we achieved together!

###### Mike:
Mike it was great to get the chance to see your working style and habits more closely and I feel like I could continue to learn more about your excellent problem solving skills. You were a great asset to our team and a pleasant character to be around. I’m certain you’ll see a lot of success in your software future and thanks for all the hard work!

###### Chase:
You’re a really fun guy to be around and I had some good times with you this mod. If we were to work together again I’d love to see you take more ownership of the work you’re involved with. I really appreciate your effort and I wish you the best.

###### Matt:
Really appreciated your hard work on Quantified self where we got thrown in the deep end of the javascript pool! You were great to pair with and our hard work paid off! One suggestion for you might be to work on communication so that you’re able express yourself really clearly when talking about the code you’re working on. Thanks for all that work!

### Being a Community Member

###### Jon:
Lee it was awesome being at Turing School together, I'm super glad we got the chance to meet and work together.  Your natural curiosity, persitance, and attitude were HUGE assets to the mod for our whole 7 months here.  I truely think because of your keen ciritcal thinking skills, people skills, intelligence, and love of learning you'll accomplish anything you set your mind to.  I'm super excited to see what you get up to in the future.  You're going to be an incredibly strong dev/programmer and someone I imagine I'll learn alot from in the future. You got mad gumption!  From our first day meeting at the pre-turing event in the kitchen, to robo-pies, to wrapping up our final projects its been cool, thanks man!

###### Matt:
I worked with Lee on our first project in quantified self.  He was a great person to pair with and I thought we worked very well together.  I really value Lee's ability to give 100% all the time.  His work ethic is second to none and I believe he is one of the hardest working students in the class.  I really appreciated his knowledge of coding as well.  I learned a lot working with Lee and feel he has some of the best processes when working with code.  He has many shortcuts that help with speedy code delivery and his git workflow is one to be bragged about.  The only advice I would give to Lee is to have confidence in working in teams and let go of the reins a little bit when working in groups.  He has great pride in his code and wants to be a part of every step of the process when working on a project.  I know that if he works in groups that deliver as much as he does he can do great things.  I would work with Lee in the future anytime.

###### Mike:
Lee was a great partner to work during Monocle.  He has possibly the best work ethic of the whole cohort, and he takes great pride in all the work he completes.  I really enjoyed pairing with him due to his conscientious nature.  I learned a lot from his work habits, as well as his organization.

###### Alisher:
I have worked with Lee for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He has demonstrated great work ethic and put in a lot of hours into the projects. He also has a great team spirit and is an excellent collaborator.

### Playing a Part

This module I was able to support the larger Turing community in a number of ways. In addition to some basic household things like emptying or loading the dishwasher:

* I co-hosted a spike session with Ryan about Vim before he left to start at his new job. We had a surprisingly high attendance and were able to split into two groups, one that was working on things at a basic first-time level and another group that worked on more advanced topics like plugins and more complex motion/action combinations.

* I paired with Max Glassie several times, once on Feb. 22 where we talked about the Ruby Design Patterns book and another time Feb. 23 where we paired on some capybara css syntax.

* I paired with Seth Mo Feb. 23 on the topic of sales engine and ruby's BigDecimal.

* I helped Casey Macaulay with a mysterious dropdown/materialize issue Feb. 26

### Gear Up

#### [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The case of the polygons interactive website is the perfect impersonal tool for engagement on the issue. In it the little polygons aren't happy unless a certain percentage of the population around them is similar to them.

I think this presentation is a great way to get at the issue without involving the personalities or feelings of blame/guilt/being attacked that often accompany such discussions.

I believe this example also displays well how tiny bias can shape our society to such a large degree. I always have a hard time imagining a ton of really hateful people, sure, they exist, but the shape of our society is driven largely by the resulting summation of a million tiny little bits.

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

We started out the session feeling pretty bubbly and good about the idea of automating things. This was quickly sobered by the numbers presented in the films. Although only the side of the story that believed the automation of everything would ultimately be to the detriment of society, this is a huge issue that needs to be thought about deeply in order for us to have a plan and to decide rationally about the future of humankind.

The numbers involved in the current population (which is growing) that will be impacted by such automation is staggering and our societies current subscription to capitalism, and thus an ultimate drive towards automation, make it truly seem like the automation of everything is an inevitability. In my mind I feel like as a whole of humanity we could make the decision to be inefficient or purpose, to override the impulse and impetus of capital towards more profit and efficiency. History and common-sense suggest that the consensus of such a mass of people is impossible.

In a macabre way, the decision to be a part of the tech industry is a decision to attempt to keep oneself in the dwindling population of those who are relatively unaffected by this automation (until of course the road leads ultimately to obviating the necessity of the programmer by automating programming itself).


#### [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Universal Basic Income doesn't really seem like the solution to such a societal upheaval as the automation of most human endeavors seems to suggest. It is also very unclear who will be the entity paying all the people their monthly dues. I'm sure that I don't know the solution to the whole thing. UBI is some sort of attempt to justify the implementation of automation in every corner of life. 'It will free us to do the things that matter'. I wonder how deeply engrained the idea of work is in the human psyche. Would people without jobs be able to find the meaning they need to be relatively content?

------------------
