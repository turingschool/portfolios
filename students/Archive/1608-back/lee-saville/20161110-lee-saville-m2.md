# Lee Saville - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a proficiency in using the various web tools we'll spend our time learning in module 2 i.e. rails and sinatra. Additionally I'd like to round out more of the professional skills that we began in module 1. I'd like to push myself to occupy the elder role in pairing situations as I strive to discover how mentorship fits into my future career plans.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

Feature Completeness

ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

Rails Style

 * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

Collaboration

 * 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Blog

My blog post on using fabrication [here](https://gist.github.com/lsaville/21aed1962ea0fe620176c17c7d14772e)

#### Mix Master

In Mix Master I think it was the first time I really saw in detail the technique of pulling forms out into partials. In addition we tapped into the error messages that are created automatically when a record isn't saved to the database because there are missing pieces of data that are validated in the model.

#### IdeaBox

IdeaBox gave me more practice in the nesting of resources and how that relates to the url paths. The bigger takeaway was getting practice with authorization and authentication.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lsaville/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

Job Tracker is an app that allows you to keep track of jobs at various companies. It allowed us to delve into the CRUDing of slightly more complex relationships on the database level, while exercising our abilities in terms of what ActiveRecord provides for us to use.

###### Evaluation/Scores

Database, Relationships, and Migrations:

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

Routes:

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

Controllers:

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

User Experience

* 3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.

Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

###### Reflection

Job Tracker was very challenging for me and I spent a ton of time getting the project as done as possible (as always wishing I had more time to pump up the jam). Some particularly tough parts for me were accessing distant database relations through a joins table and some of the analysis layer logic. It was also our first time doing the rails thing primarily solo so it was a time full of questions like 'is this the legit way to do this thing?'. I ate my humble pie and can now see it as one of the many turing opportunities for growth.

A thing I learned from Ryan (and his relative speed compared to mine in resolving problems) on this project is that when things don't work you should start questioning all the assumptions leading you to believe that a thing should be working. Seems like I should've been doing that all along you say? I learned about myself that I often think about a problem too much. The assumption tactic has helped me in the interim to solve more problems by myself and will hopefully continue to help in building self confidence in tackling difficult problems.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects in module 2 have overall gone better than they had in module 1. Here we get the chance to exercise our technical skills in varying group dynamics, all the while learning about ourselves and how we react to those dynamics. These lessons will serve us well in the future since we will almost certainly be working in teams in the industry.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour is a micro-scale imitation of website analytics in which we take lots simplified payloads and shove them into our database for viewing/analysis. This is our very first taste of bridging the gap between what we know about OOP and the world of MVC frameworks.

Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

View Layer
* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

###### Reflection

Rush Hour was an interesting project in that it was our first taste of the power of rails through working with Active Record. We weren't sure of all the methods available to us and thus did things in a much harder way than we should have. Our working in a group of three was also an interesting new dynamic that I had yet to explore and I came out of it being aware of my tendency to want to pair the majority of the time in a group project in general. While this isn't a terrible thing its now on my radar that I should feel more comfortable in the future breaking off a chunk of a project and working on it alone. This aspect of group work should definitely be explicitly talked about in the groups DTR. RH also was nice in the way it mimicked a real thing (obviously stripped down), the way a real website analytics program might function.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

How fitting that I should be reviewing the vote your conscience gear up on the day after the election...

###### At the time:

I would try to emphasize the part about 'if you were in their shoes'. Its very easy to opt out, but without tying the concepts to experience or imagined experience it is hard to make someone care. I think that the way conversation is framed makes all the difference. If you can help someone develop empathy, you will go a long way to helping the situation. It hinges on the idea of community. It is sometimes very hard to feel as though you're part of the 'national community'.

My attitude to voting is that it is hard to be engaged in what seems to be a system that doesn't work very well. I do vote in major elections, occasionally in smaller ones. It seems that the entrenched two party system is that way because of monied elites.

The temptation is to not vote because it doesn't make a difference. Citizenship activity is based on the feeling of community which I don't particularly feel. I'm very privileged to feel that way.

###### Now:

Clearly the bubble in which I live doesn't share experience or attributes with that in which a majority of people in the US live.
How could Trump sound like a good idea?

#### Introversion

I have been in a team where my pair was more introverted than I am. The challenge was in communication and planning. The benefit was slowing down my jumpy nature.

An introvert's strengths are that they think more deeply through and are more perhaps more methodical. Their weakness is that they are apt to get trampled by other natures.

An extrovert's strengths are that they excel in direct/loud communication. They can be the tramplers without even noticing. They might tend towards less depth.

We are all on a spectrum between full extrovert and full introvert and it seems difficult to let each have their preferred environment for working. A good thing to try is to give each space to achieve within their strengths. One way of doing this might be to set a period of time before making a decision to allow room for introverts so the group doesn't just follow the first to speak (typically the extrovert).


#### Resilience

I've heard about the power of framing, thinking about your experience in a different way that strongly influences your perception of events. This seems to be true and affirms what I've heard. Implementing that in your life is a little different and is something that I've not fully achieved. I'd like for my automatic response to potentially negative experiences be a reframing on autopilot. I've had the great fortune of putting myself (by choice) into somewhat difficult situations and committing to their fulfillment, and this has allowed me in a sense to force myself to reframe things. Having the experience of having uncomfortable experiences go well or badly based on my framing of the situation has shown me in a direct way that framing is potentially very powerful.

I believe in personal resilience. It allows you to do more meaningful things in your life. It makes you more reliable and is a trait that I admire.

Knowing about resilience is certainly different than being able to implement it fully. In practice you must be able to catch yourself going negative and correct path by consciously shifting that frame.

### Professional Development Workshops

Our professional development workshops this module focused heavily on starting to build our professional networks through various tactics. I found it really valuable to think of the whole thing almost akin to growing a plant... You start small with some seeds and keep watering the thing, giving it sun, and you continue with patience in the hope it will grow.

In the upcoming break I've reached out to some people that I have warm and hot connections with, will be attending at least one meetup:

* Lunch with my friend Yohannes who is head of engineering at Nuvectra, a biomedical implant company in Broomfield. He is attempting to get another connection of his with a lot of web development experience to attend the lunch as well.

* Drinks with an android developer who works in Golden.

* Bike ride/drinks with a developer at school runner, who is speaking with his boss about me shadowing over the break.

* Going to the Yehuda Katz meet-up where I hope to speak again with Mike Pack, who I met at the Rocky Mountain Ruby conference, and also meet other people. Obviously hear what Katz has to say also...

* Going to a google developers meet-up where I hope to continue to flush out what direction I might want to go in the industry and meet more people.

### Reflection

###### Project Management Skills

In the group projects we used our DTR to flush out some of the details of working together. A solid DTR has been and continues to be of primary importance, alerting the group as a whole to potential points of friction from the group's inception. Technically we appointed a specific group member to be the project manager, in my groups this role was never explicitly invoked, the group spreading out responsibility in a more or less natural way. I could see that if tensions were high or in other contexts, the naming of a specific project manager would be important (in my slight understanding a real project manager wouldn't actually be on the programming team). We also tried using waffle, with more or less success. It seemed a good way to keep track of things in a larger group, by assigning the cards to a team member. In my groups it was used lightly as a to-do or a wish list.

###### Incorporating Feedback

I received feedback regarding my willingness to split off some work to complete by myself. I was able to do small parts of little shop alone but still haven't had/created the opportunity to do full on divide and conquer. It seems like it will come more easily with more experience and I feel that I would more willing to split off now towards the end of the module than when I first received the feedback at the beginning.

I received more feedback in the past couple days regarding my focusing on the task at hand and not getting sucked into rabbit-holes. I think it's a valuable point especially considering we need to be prioritizing our time constantly at Turing. Being able to judge accurately which tasks are most important and ignoring some shiny/fancy things even though they are attractive is important.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member
#### Giving Feedback
Jon:<br><br>
Jon, you’ve been a real treat to work with on little shop, I’m definitely grateful that the opportunity to work together came up. One thing you might continue to work on is ‘footwork’ , getting more comfortable with workflow and some of the small things that will speed up the transition between idea, and the code making it to the file. You continue you spark my interest in self-development and I appreciate the opportunity to brainstorm and get feedback/criticism/encouragement with/from you. Thanks for all the hard work and the bulk of time on little shop!

Ben:<br><br>
Ben, I love how eager you are to get things to work. In the future you could perhaps be more aware of your strong inclination towards divide and conquer and communicate that more clearly in your DTRs. In addition, sometimes it seemed like your frustration with not having the answer right away prevented you from moving forward on a problem, It’d be great to see you harness that eagerness to solve problems and not let not having the answer slow you down. You’ve definitely inspired me to try and become more comfortable with divide and conquer in the future and it was great working with you!

Megan:<br><br>
Megan, you were delightful to work with, I think we shared a similar preference for the pairing dynamic, and overall meshed well in personality and disposition. Going into the future we can both work on feeling more comfortable with a divide/conquer scenario. Thanks for the hard work!
#### Getting Feeback

Jon:<br><br>
Lee you were an ideal partner to have on a project, you were hard working and knowledgable on a wide range of subjects, and enjoyed working together even during the 12+ hour days.  Watching your work flow I learned a lot about how to approach problems, persist to find solutions, and admired your ambitions when it comes to implementing functions you've dreamed up.  If there was one thing I think you could improve upon it would be to focus on the function at hand and time-box when pursuing any potential features. I think these subtle tweaks to your workflow will lead to greater results and time to pursue additional features at the end of the project.  Thanks for being such a great partner, I had a blast working together and am looking forward to crushing more code together in the future!

Ben:<br><br>
Lee is an extremely energetic and inquisitive partner to have in any group. His tenacity in finding answers in amazing and inspiring. During our retro he was extremely professional and made it easy to discuss what went I needed to work on in the future. His desire to learn as much as possible is extremely valuable. I would suggest that sometime it is not imperative to learn the intricacies of a system to implement it. Trying to learn the code base, though valuable, may lead down rabbit holes that may not serve the groups direction or time frame. I think when we talked about time boxing tangents it was helpful. I think that continuing that is extremely helpful in any group or individual endeavor.  Lee is always positive and will always bring so much to any group he is part of.

Megan:<br><br>
Lee was an amazing partner.  We worked together on this project very closely, and I learned a ton from him. He is very patient with other people's questions, and is also very open to ask questions of his own. He is also very flexible and easy going, making it super easy to work with him. We probably both could have worked on more effectively splitting up work, but I think that is something that will come with time. Overall, I was very happy to have the chance to work with Lee!

### Playing a Part

###### Pairing

This module I offered a lot of pairing availability to the module 1 students. All said I spent 8 hours with various students.

I started timidly, wondering how much information was too much, but quickly warmed up. For my short experience I think I achieved a pretty good balance of socratic questioning and giving information such that I wasn't doing anything for them but also they weren't banging their heads against the wall alone.

I'd like to continue to explore pairing to make some educated decisions around job pursuits in the mentoring/culture-fit categories.

###### Try Turing

I was able to offer time as a TA at a recent Try Turing event where I spent 3-4 hours offering help to potential students trying their hand at some programming over the weekend.

I attended an overflow offshoot of Try Turing that led to my being accepted. It was amazing to see the potential students mull over the same prospect that to me seems so long ago. How far we've come, and how far we'll go.
