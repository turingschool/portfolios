# Lee Saville - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out keen to learn all about apis, what they are and even how to build one. They seem to allow a developer to do much more interesting things then they could otherwise in isolation. Additionally this module will likely be one in which I solidify my understanding of rails in general, as well a deepening of potential options with their trade-offs.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how *YOU* would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Development**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module we had a chance to work on two individual projects, apicurious(ungraded), and the self-directed project. The self-directed project in particular let us spread our wings and dive into something new and unknown if we wanted to. I chose to explore React and javascript and learned a bit about the React philosophy, js closures, and a few of the differences between ecma5 and ecma6 while interacting with the google maps api.

#### Workaday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lsaville/workaday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module3/projects/self_directed_project.md)
* [Project Pitch](https://gist.github.com/lsaville/6238444ce4ff02951f966bcf16fd1dfb)

Workaday is a small firm construction management app that aims to provide clarity for all the parties involved(supervisor, workers, home owner) by providing a central general organization around a project. The project has comments from the supervisor and home-owner as well as general details and a google map showing its location. The worker can get directions to the location by using a google autocomplete search input.

I wanted to emulate micro-service architecture in the project and the app is 'dog-fed' by an internal api, bypassing the traditional controller/view interactions in favor of sending to and getting data from the api. Additionally I set out to explore a new technology to me, React, and was able to learn a ton about javascript and something about the allure of React.

Notes:
* Really great job. Even though you feel like you wanted to do more,
* I think this is still a really solid project considering you took the risk with React.
* Used a lot of tools to stay organized which is great to see. This helped us figure out how to reset expectations and requirements when needed.
* Room for refactoring in the code, but understandable since you were using a framework you haven't used before.
* User Experience needs a little work, getting things lined up on a page but overall, still looks really great.

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.

**2. Organization**

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had several group projects this module, and they were bigger/more difficult projects that tried the capacity of the individuals involved to better manage the project and devise strategies to get all the work done.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dijital2016/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

Rails Engine takes the data from the Sales Engine project and sets the student up to create an api only app with some of the most difficult relations involved that forced us to up our game in terms of querying techniques.


#### Project Rubric

**1. Completion**

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

Students: Dave and myself

#### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/cloney-island)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

Cloney Island composed the largest project any of us had worked on to date. This meant that the work was more compartmentalized between the team members and ensured that there was some code written that you had never seen before at the end. The project also gave me my first chance at ajax calls, which I had been wondering about for some time prior.

Our project was "Vicarious.li" and mimicked the popular crowd funding site Kickstarter. The scale of our project in comparison to the real Kickstarter gave real insight into the size of many of the real life apps we all use day to day!

## D: Professional Development

The professional development sessions continued strong, giving us valuable information surrounding cold contact tactics, networking, technical interviews, and job search strategies to help us on our path to 'offer accepted'

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/lsaville/b6abdc1cbb414f667d261ace9d78ad7b)

The flower exercise is to help us examine our personal stories and help get us acquainted with those details. This is incredibly helpful as it forces us to think about ourselves in a way that isn't the most natural, but which is important to prepare us for the presentation of ourselves to strangers and also as a tool to help define where we want to eventually be. I found this exercise to be difficult and I plan to keep engaging with the material and ideas presented into the future.

#### Networking

Networking is a crucial aspect of our futures as software developers and one that takes time to cultivate. This session helped me to realize more about how to chat with people, including the concept of not going into any situation empty handed. Things go much more smoothly and productive if you've got a set of stock questions in addition to any specific ones.

Between the holidays and being busy with project work, I was only able to attend one meet-up this module, but there I was able to reinforce some warm connections I had made previously. I'm excited to go to more events in the future.

#### Job Search Strategies

The job search strategies session really drove home the importance of getting started with job related preparations as soon as possible, the end of my Turing life is just around the corner and it's too much to be stuck with at the end. I really appreciate the tips about rigid scheduling for when we're out of Turing and on the job search full time. Utilizing the structure will help with the transition.


#### Technical Interviews

The session was awesome and it was great to get the perspective of an individual who has both been interviewed and interviews actively. The subject of technical interviews is intimidating and this was my first experience hearing more about the details of the interviewing process. I also appreciate the perspective of it being hard for the interviewer as well. That information brings the whole thing into a more human light and I feel will help ease the tension of any interviews I am a part of.

I was able to fit a mock interview in and I think its really interesting to think about the differences in interviewing style. The person I got to try questions on me was less inclined to do actual coding and was more interested in asking questions about how I felt about my code, what I was proud of, and what I thought could be worked on. This one experience has given me a lot of material to work with as far as tying my earlier comment about not coming empty handed, and I haven't even done the other mock interviews. I realize also that I have work to do regarding the other styles of tech interview as well, and have plans to 'work on my chops' in upcoming free time.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Dave - Lovely working with you on rails engine. I like how you keep at it when things get down to the wire. One suggestion as far as workflow goes would be to practice with keyboard shortcuts to decrease the amount of time spent getting to the place you'd like to go. I was really pleased to have you as a partner on the project, and appreciate your calm energy.

Anthony -  I love your excellent work ethic, you definitely put in the time on Cloney Island. Working together closely on the project was a great experience. One suggestion for improvement would be to not be discouraged on a really tough problem, but keep beating on the wall. I really appreciate all the care you put into the styling and overall had an excellent project experience with you

Noah - I like how you powered through and did a thing you cared about even though none of the rest of the team could help. I think it was great that all of us got to do a thing we were interested in on a bigger project that could be compartmentalized in such a way. While the project turned out great I think its good to be aware of when you're too far down a hole and be ready to 'kill the baby'. Your contributions in PR comments were exemplar and you've inspired me to be more thorough in the group code reviews. I had a great experience working with you, Thanks!

Ben - I love how you jump right into a project. It's definitely motivating for the other members of the team. As a slight improvement, I'd like to see you be a bit calmer and methodical when you're not sure what's going on with a bug. Great working with you again on Cloney Island, keep up the enthusiasm.

### Being a Community Member
##### Feedback to me
Ben - Lee, once again, was a phenomenal partner to work with. Lee Has a tenacity for finding answers to problems and creative yet simple solutions. His ability to spearhead the AJAX calls was amazing. You can certainly tell when Lee is in the midst of something and wants it to come to production and it gives the group a fantastic chemistry.  One thing I  did see that I think Lee is already aware of if being able to handle the management of a project. With all the moving parts of Cloney Island there was a lot going on to keep track of. Utilizing Waffle a bit more might have helped with some of the  duplication of cards and stories.

Dave - Lee…you were a great partner on RailsEngine.  Your git skills are impressive and your attention to detail and process will serve you very well as you embark on what I am sure will be a very successful career as a developer.  I particularly enjoyed your laid back style even when deadlines were looming and stress levels high.

Noah - It was great working with Lee on Cloney Island. His persistence and drive to understand every facet of an idea or issue was a massively valuable asset to our group. I hadn’t had the chance to work with Lee before and I was glad to get the chance to do so, hopefully we’ll work together again! He tackled challenge after challenge (ajax! API authentication!) and our site/project was way better for it. Thanks in particular for tolerating my wandering around the AWS rabbit hole - I learned a _ton_ and I really appreciate having had the opportunity!

Anthony - This was my first time working with Lee and I was really blown away by how he was able to talk about problems in a simple/understandable way. Lee and I paired on a majority of the project and it was awesome. I really enjoyed working with Lee because he helped me understand that I need to be more patient and to slow down. He does true TDD that helps you really understand the problem and make sure you are not making any mistakes.

### Playing a Part

This module I played a part in the Turing community by making an effort to be engaged in the gear-up discussions/volunteered to speak about a thing first. As a direct piece I loaded/unloaded the dishwasher a few times. I volunteered to be a pre-work mentor for a third time and lastly (soft/no contribution) I was daily-tweeter twice. There is always more that a person can do.

#### Turing-lab posse

I was a part of turing-lab posse this mod and while I wasn't able to dive in as much as I'd have liked to based on project work, I had some fun experiences playing with hardware, partnering with Ryan on some of his alexa activities, and trying to run java and node apps/servers to try and get to the alexa api without having a dot or echo. I plan on doing to side projects with iot and hardware in the future and really appreciate the free-form style of the turing-lab posse.

### Gear Up
##### [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

In my mind all the gear ups that ever were and will be are about awareness/empathy. An individual should understand that the world is drastically different for persons besides oneself, to the point that it may be impossible for you to imagine yourself into a fraction of what they are experiencing. We should be aware of gut reactions that lead people to microaggressions and to think about the things we say. Jean had a good comment about allowing the person you're interacting with the chance to define who they are instead of making assumptions. I would like to implement this into my person, ignoring stereotypes that I might have and let the people show themselves through their actions.

##### [Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Journey mapping was an interesting exploration of mapping the user experience along with their emotions and a timeline. This sort of activity encourages us to play user and imagine what frustrations we might have interacting with a product and will surely lead us to creating higher quality software products. This ties in with Josh's plea to use behavior driven development. An aspect of the Journey mapping that is out of our ordinary mode of thinking about our applications is all the activity that a user might engage in outside actually using a service or app that indirectly affects that experience, such as the path to discovering a service/product and their gathering of competitors data/budget concerns etc.

##### [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit seems like the magic buzzword in success psychology. It does seem to have some basis in reality however and I really like it combined with the growth mindset (in which knowledge and growth is possible, it just takes hard work to get there). It seems like you have to be careful with any 'silver bullet' and this is no exception. I appreciated during the session when some people brought up the fact that the concept of grit could be just another tool with which to deal out blame as in "that person just doesn't have enough grit". Additionally there could be a socio-economic piece in which it's significantly easier to have grit in proportion to a persons privilege. I think that these terms and techniques are better applied within the scope of self, as in give the benefit of the doubt to someone else, but try to apply the standards to oneself. Perhaps by utilizing that combo you can reap the personal benefits of the concept but keep the whole pot from going sour.
