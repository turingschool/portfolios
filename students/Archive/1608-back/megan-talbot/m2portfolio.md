# Megan Talbot - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals at the beginning of this mod were to learn more about the fundamentals of web applications; be able to build a web application  on my own; understand what happens when someone visits a website; improve my use of keyboard shortcuts; and build a broader foundation of HTML/CSS capabilities.  <br>
I am happy to say that I have accomplished all of those goals.  I am very pleased with all of my projects from this module. I hope to continue to work on each of them to be able to use them on my resume. It's almost hard to believe that I learned all of these things in 6 weeks, and how little I knew coming into Mod 2!

3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process<br>


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module had 3 main individual projects. It was interesting for me to look back on my progression throughout this module and inspect earlier projects. I have made quite a bit of progress from Mix Master to Job Tracker! It's clear that I learned a lot from all of these projects, and I know I will refer back to each of them often.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was a project which focused on creating an application to track job leads for an individual. This was a solo project, and I was tasked with using migrations to make tables with appropriate relationships, using Active Records for database queries, setting the appropriate routes, using controllers to create CRUD functionality, and setting up my views following best practices. <br>

I enjoyed this project quite a bit and was happy to see my progress in such a tangible way. The new "analysis" section was more challenging that what I had created in the past, but I was happy to be able to complete that section as well.  I have also focused on refactoring this project a bit, and plan to continue to do so over my intermission week.

__Evaluation Scores:__<br>
4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.<br>
3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.<br>
3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.<br>
4: ActiveRecord methods are used in models to supply all appropriate functionality. Methods exist on the appropriate model, and developers are not referencing other classes or self in models unnecessarily. Ruby enumerables are not used where ActiveRecord methods could provide the necessary functionality. The developer can explain the ActiveRecord methods they used and the relationships between ActiveRecord models.<br>
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.<br>
4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.<br>
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features<br>


#### Rails Mini Project 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/gif-generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)
* [Heroku Link](https://pacific-retreat-21818.herokuapp.com/)

This was an unscored individual project in which we were able to choose which project we wanted to work on. I chose the "gif generator" where a user can login, browse gifs, and favorite their own. There is also admin functionality, in which an admin can generate gifs. I need to work a bit on refactoring this project, as well as improving the testing. However, this project was a lot of fun for me, and I plan to work on it a bit more in intermission week as well to use as part of my portfolio/resume. (P.S. Check it out on Heroku!)

#### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

This was more of a tutorial style project where we made our first real application in rails. We made an app that could keep track of songs, artists, and playlists. This project was very thorough and clear in expectations, but it was very helpful as well. I even added the Spotify login, which was an optional extension, but very cool to be able to complete. It was also the first project that I pushed to Heroku. I really enjoyed being able to actually show people something I had created on Heroku! This is a project that I would certainly want to clean up styling-wise, but I stil very satisfied with my it. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module included two group projects.  The first, Rush Hour, was a tool to analzye and display web traffic information, which we built with Sinatra. The second was called Little Shop, in which we created an ecommerce website with Rails. The projects were both interesting and presented new topics as we went, and I'm happy to say that I learned a lot from each. 

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was a project to build a tool to track and analyze web traffic. It was a 3 person team project, and as a group we accepted data through what we called a payload, analyzed it, and then displayed the results on a website. We created this project in Sinatra and utilized Active Record and Ruby as well. It was essentially a tool that worked like Google Analytics. I think we did a good job with this project, successfully completing all functionality and learning a ton about the content and about group dynamics.

__Evaluation Scores:__<br>
3: Application fulfills base expectations<br>
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data<br>
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP<br>
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring<br>
3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.<br>
3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view<br>
(not graded)3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.<br>

*From Ben Pepper:*<br>
Megan was a great project manager. Her attention to detail made sure that we always completely finished an iteration before moving on. Her drive to fully understand a problem was instrumental in the group learning as much as possible. Our working styles were not in sync but during our retro she was extremely professional in bringing it up and discussing it. She made it easy to understand what happened and her thoughts on how to move forward. I learned a lot from her about how to work more effectively in a group and it will only prove to be helpful through out Turing.<br>
<br>
*From Lee Saville:*<br>
Megan, you were delightful to work with, I think we shared a similar preference for the pairing dynamic, and overall meshed well in personality and disposition. Going into the future we can both work on feeling more comfortable with a divide/conquer  scenario. Thanks for the hard work!


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/root_and_branch)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop was a project in which we built an online ecommerce website. Our project was called Root & Branch, and we created an online marketplace for selling socially conscious goods. This was a really fun project as well, and I am very happy with our end result. We were able to more effectively split up work than I have in past projects, which kept our progress moving along. Working on a team of all women, I was especially pleased to have such a successful project. All of my teammates were wonderful to work with, and I was proud to be a part of this group.



## D: Professional Skills

### Blog Post

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this gear up, we focused on the idea of voting as a responsibility of citizenship. We had lots of reading, refelection, and a fair amount of discussion time. We got to choose from a couple different topics, and I selected the topic of whether or not one should vote in America. My group had varying ideas about this topic, but we were all able to express those ideas. Many people felt disillusioned with the political process, particularly at a national level.  We did all agree, however, that local elections are vastly impactful and important. 


#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This session was about different personality traits, particularly extroversion vs introversion, and how they should be handled best in team environments. I enjoyed that this gear up was conducted in our cohorts, especially since those are the people who make up the teams that I work with while at Turing. I tend to identify as both an introvert and an extrovert, so I often see this issue from both sides. In my discussion group, we all agreed that we could focus more on allowing individual work in teams for introverts. Ultimately, I think the most important thing is to be aware that other people may have a different preference for working styles. 


#### Resilience 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

The final gear up of this mod focused on the idea of resilience, and how that can be beneficial for us going forward. I tend to think of myself as resilient, but I think it's important that everything is relative to an individual. I liked the articles on this topic, in that they discussed what makes someone resilient. It seems that it often comes down to perspective. One thing we talked about in my group was the idea that it's important to try to be resilient yourself, but it's dangerous territory to tell someone else to be more resilient, because that could easily turn toward victim-blaming. In general, resilence is a great trait, and I think it's something that I will continue to try to practice as I go forward in an undoubtedly difficult career. 



### Professional Development Workshops


#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/gthNySRX/megan-talbot-job-search-company-tracker) - Company Tracker

Lia made some excellent points in this session, centered around the idea of finding new opportunities. She discussed how she uses Meetup.com to find new companies or contacts, and then uses websites like LinkedIn as follow-up. It's also always a good idea to Google a company or even a contact at that company. I used many of her suggestions to create my Trello job search board, which I am continuing to update frequently. 

#### Cold Outreach

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/tree/master/module_two)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/gthNySRX/megan-talbot-job-search-company-tracker) - Company Tracker

This was a follow-up from the "Finding Opportunities" session, and we talked about how to reach out the contacts we had previously identified.  I reached out to 3 different companies, as reflected in my Trello board.  I have only heard back from one person, who was unfortunately not available to help, but I am hopeful that something good will come from my cold outreach efforts. And I am more comfortable with my ability to reach out to someone new after this session with Meg.


#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

This was a session focused on the idea of effective collaborative communication in teams. We did this session immediately prior to kicking off Rush Hour, which I thought was a very effective tactic. We had some reading from "How to Win Friends & Influence People in the Digital Age", and then we spent some time discussing in our groups. I enjoyed the chance to have these disussions with my Rush Hour partners, and thought it was useful to have this session before our DTR as well.


### Reflection

We used many different project management styles in my two projects this module.  In Rush Hour, we time-boxed trying new things, which was very effective, in addition to using tools like Waffle and Slack. Time-boxing helped us explore new things but also know when to move on. We probably could have done a better job of re-DTRing. There were different working styles at play in our group, and I don't think we identified that early enough. I think we were still very successful, but I have always tried to remember from now on that it's best to try to check in with your teammates as much as possible. <br>

In Little Shop, we had a very thorough DTR and did a much better job of checking in often. We also did stand-ups, since we were able to split up work in an effective way between the four of us. I think we also did a great job of utilizing Waffle in this project, which keps us very clearly on track. I think our project management and workflow in Little Shop was the best and most effecient of any project I've worked on up to this date.<br>

I tried to incorporate feedback about these issues to make myself better in each project. I learned that it's always best to be as thorough as possible, to check in often, and to set clear expectations.  These things make me feel more comfortable on a project, which in turn will hopefully make me a more effective and succesful teammate. <br>



## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*To Lee Saville:*<br>
Lee was an amazing partner.  We worked together on this project very closely, and I leanred a ton from him. He is very patient with other people's questions, and is also very open to ask questions of his own. He is also very flexible and easy going, making it super easy to work with him. We probably both could have worked on more effectively splitting up work, but I think that is something that will come with time. Overall, I was very happy to have the chance to work with Lee!<br>
<br>
*To Ben Pepper:*<br>
Ben was a great partner. He was very open to answering questions and trying new things. Ben was also incredibly open to feedback and appreciated honesty. We probably could have been a little more clear with each other about our preferred working styles, but we all realized that and agreed to take note going forward.  I was happy to have him as a partner!<br>
<br>
*To Ali Schlereth:*<br>
Ali was, as always, a great partner for me this module. We got the chance to work together on Little Shop, and I was very grateful for that opportunity. Ali is always supportive and willing to hear different opinions. At the same time, she is eager to help with anything. I will miss working on a project with her, but am so glad that we were able to do that at least once! And I know she will continue to be as supportive as always going forward. <br>
<br>
*To Anna Dolan:*<br>
Anna was an awesome partner. We worked together on our Little Shop project, and we paired together for most of our work. I am very pleased with how much we were able to get done. Anna is a really hard worker and I always appreciated how much she was willing to do! I know we will continue to support each other in future modules, and I look forward to those opportunities. <br>
<br>
*To Erin Pintozzi:*<br>
Erin was such a great partner in this module. We worked together on Little Shop, and she was our fearless project manager. I learned a lot watching her work and am so glad for that opportunity. We were also both in the Bezos possee, and I again was glad to have the chance to learn from her. She is always willing to offer her opinion but also super open to hearing from other people. I will miss working with her on Little Shop, but I'm glad that we will have the chance to still work together in other ways in the future!<br>
<br>
*To Jon Kimble:*<br>
Jon was an awesome partner for me this module. We were SAB reps together as well as working together with the Bezos posse. He was super willing to jump in and help with anything. He immediately offered to help with the clothing/food drive and the Glow in the Gardens event. He was always willing to step up to his SAB duties, as well as being an active member of Bezos. I will miss working with him on SAB next mod but know he will continue to do a great job!<br>
<br>

### Being a Community Member

*From Lee Saville:*<br>
Megan, you were delightful to work with, I think we shared a similar preference for the pairing dynamic, and overall meshed well in personality and disposition. Going into the future we can both work on feeling more comfortable with a divide/conquer  scenario. Thanks for the hard work!<br>
<br>
*From Ben Pepper:*<br>

<br>
*From Anna Dolan:*<br>
Megan and I worked together on Little Shop this module. Megan is a hard worker and a great collaborator. She and I paired for most of the project, and we were able to get a lot of work done together. She is good at offering her opinion in a kind way, and is open to others' ideas. I look forward to workin with her in future modules on both group and individual projects.<br>
<br>
*From Erin Pintozzi:*<br>
Megan, what a great surprise to have the opportunity to together again on a group project. First off, I think we did sooo much better with the planning and workflow that we struggled with in Mod 1. You  make intentional decisions that help us get code right the first time, and you also have a persistence to help keep the team's head up and get things done. I'm sure you experienced moments of frustration, but honestly, it never really showed which is an unbelievable quality to have on a team and one that I think would make you an excellent team leader.<br>
<br>
*From Ali Schlereth:*<br>
Megan is a hard working insightful individual. She has an attention to detail and always willing to collaborate. Throughout the entire module, I always knew that I could go to Megan as a resource for both technical as well as emotional support. This was also true in our Little Shop project. She does a great job voicing her opinion while also listening to others. I appreciate when she pushes back on others' suggestions when she has a differing opinion. She is comfortable giving something a try and perservering until it works, and works well. Thank you for your leadership and support! <br>
<br>
*From Jon Kimble:*<br>
It was fantastic working with Megan in Bezos Posse and I couldn't have asked for a better partener on S.A.B.!  During S.A.B. Megan volunteered to lead the effort for glow in the gardens and played a big part in making the community event happen for everyone in school.  She always had keen insights during our S.A.B. discussion and was a great person to have representing our whole mod.  I was particularly impressed during out weekly retros where she took a lead roll and gracefully handled the various feedback and discussions we had as a group.  Megan also organized a Bezos posse field trip to visit her brother at Go Spot Check which was one of my favorite moments of all of module 2. I admire Megans strong communication skills, clear thinking, and willingness to give back to the community and we're all better off for having her here at Turing!




### Playing a Part

I was happy to be able to continue my involvement with the Student Advisory Board this module. I really enjoyed being part of SAB and will sad to leave next mod!  SAB duties generally consisted of attending weekly meetings, bi-weekly staff retro meetings, gathering student community feedback, sharing this feedback with the rest of SAB, leading weekly retros, and communicating student facilities requests with proper staff.  I really enjoyed our weekly retro time, and thought Jon and I did a great job of leading these sessions. Addditionally, I helped to plan the Glow in the Gardens event, as well as helping set up our food/clothing drive over the course of this module. I'm happy to say that the Glow in the Gardens was a success, and I hope that we are able to collect a solid amount of canned food and warm clothes to help out the greater Denver community during these winter months.<br>
<br> 
Additionally, I was active in Joan Clarke society, attending every weekly coffee meeting this mod. I also paired with Mod 1 students 7 different times, which was hopefully at least a little bit as helpful for them as it was for me! <br>
<br>
And lastly, I was involved with the Bezos posse, attending weekly lunch meetings and spike sessions. We had great discussions on things like user testing and agile development. Additionally, we did a $5 challenge, where we were each tasked with making as much money as we could with only $5. My group didn't have great success, but we learned a lot! I know that these activities will help me grow as a professional, as I have learned a ton from being around other entrepreneurial-minded people. I have also already had discussions with the current Bezos leaders to take over that role in Mod 4. And finally, I arranged for Bezos to have a meeting with the CEO of GoSpotCheck at his office. (Note: he does happen to be my brother ;), but hopefully it a very informative session!
