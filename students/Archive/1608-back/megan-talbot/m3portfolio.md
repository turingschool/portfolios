# Megan Talbot - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I entered this module with the main goal of gaining a deeper understanding of Rails. I also wanted to learn more about consuming APIs and building my own, as I had essentially no experience with APIs prior.
Additionally, I aimed to prepare myself for interviews by focusing on exercisms every week. I also hoped to make new contacts in both the Boston and Denver areas through a dedicated outreach effort.

I am happy to say I have accomplished all of my goals! I feel much more comfortable with Rails and I also know a lot about API consumption and construction. I have done my best to focus on exercisms outside of class, and I hope to continue this effort. I think my network has grown in both Boston and in Denver, but I will most definitely keep working on this as well!

**Progression/Completion**

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

**Workflow**

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I only ended up with one individual project in this module, as I worked on the client project for my self-directed with Anna Dolan. I like to work alone sometimes, so I appreciated the chance to have API Curious in this module.

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/api-curious-github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This was an ungraded project that focused on learning how to consume an external API. We were able to choose a popular API to then consume it to essentially recreate the website on our own. I chose Github and was very happy with my results! I was nervous about learning how to conusme and API, but this project was very helpful because we had to do it many times. I'm happy to say I am very comfortable consuming an API.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on 3 group projects this module - Railes Engine, Cloney Island, and the self-directed (client) project. These projects were all very challenging and came with thier own unique challenges. Looking back on where I started on the first project, I am very impressed with my progress this module on projects!

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/rails-engine-api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

This project had us create our own RESTful API to display sales data.  We built single-responsibility controllers to expose many different record endpoints, as well as more complex business relationship endpoints. This required advanced active record queries, which was very challenging but also very rewarding.  It was a hard project but I learned a ton! I thought building an API would be much more complicted than it was. I also learned about customzing JSON output and a lot more about queries databases.


__***Evaluation:***__

Notes: -

**Feature Delivery - Completion**

* **(4): Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.**

**Technical Quality - Test-Driven Development**

* **(4): Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.**

**Code Quality**

* **(3): Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

**API Design**

* **(4): Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.**

**Queries**

* **(4): Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.**



*Feedback to Alisher:*<br>
Alisher was such a supportive and helpful partner for Rales Engine!  He was always willing to try new things and very open to feedback. This was a hard project but I was very happy with our results. I unfortunately had a funeral on the last day of this project, but Alisher never missed a beat when offering to handle the eval on his own. He was very thoughtful in making sure I gained all of the  information that I could have missed, and I appreicate his eagerness to be there  for me in that way!


### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/pushpin)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

This project had us create a total application from scratch. Our group built a platform called "Pushpin", which was based off of the website Thumbtack, where people can request home improvement services.  This project had many new challenges, as we had many different levels of authorization (admin, professionals, requesters, and guests), as well as new functionality that we had never done before, such as messaging systems and two-factor authrntication.  I think we all thought that our final product was not exactly where we wanted it to be by the end of the project, but I still left very satisfied as I learned lots of new things. Part of me wishes we had more time to finish it exactly, but we did a great job with the scope and time frame we had!

__**Feedback to me:**__

*Feedback from Ryan:*<br>
Megan was an excellent team member on Cloney Island. I repeatedly saw her jump on whichever part of the project needed her, even if it wasn't an easy or glamorous task like user ratings. Though at times we faced difficult problems, pairing with Megan was always a positive experience, and I am grateful that we had the chance to work on a team while at Turing.

*Feedback from Alisher:*<br>
This module, I was in one team with Megan both for Rales Engine as well as Cloney Island. She is a great person to work with, in terms of positive attitude, collaboration, and support. In addition, she has great software development skills and has a keen eye for UI/UX details. Being a hard worker, she contributed a lot to both projects and was always willing to jump in and attack the problem. I look forward to working with Megan again!

*Feedback from Ali:*<br>
I have greatly enjoyed each opportunity Iâ€™ve had to work with Megan.  On Cloney Island, Megan and I undertook the Twilio 2Factor Authentication. As someone who is often intimidated using new development tools it was great to work with Megan as she is calm and positive when facing challenges.  In addition, Megan undertook the tasks of giving ratings and assigning proposals which involved intricate database relationships. It was a lot of work, but Megan calmly pushed through until she found success.

__**Feedback from me:**__<br>
*Feedback to Ryan:<br>*
Ryan was such a great partner for this project. He was always very eager to help anyone and jump in on any aspect of the project. I know we all wish we had the time to deliver a more polished final product, but I know we wouldn't have made even close to the same progress without Ryan! He was also super understanding of everyone's schedules and commitments, which is always appreciated in a larger group project. I would gladly work with Ryan again in the future!

*Feedback to Alisher:*<br>
I loved the chance to work with Alisher again in Cloney Island! It was a very challenging project, but Alisher was again 100% committed and eager to help with anything. We worked on some of the same features on this project, such as Ratings, and I am confident that we both learned a lot. It was great to work him Alisher again and I appreciate his willingness to jump in on anything for these projects!

*Feedback to Ali:*<br>
I felt so lucky to have a project with Ali during this module! She is always such a positive force on a team, and that was certainly the case for Cloney Island. We all tackled some tough new features, but Ali never let that get her openly frustrated with the group. Even though we all wished we had more time, I know that we  learned a ton throughout this project, which is obviously the most important thing.  I would eagerly work with Ali again any time!


### Self-Directed Project (Client) -- It Takes a Village

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/It-takes-a-village)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

I had the chance to work on the client project for the self-directed final project of the module. We started the group with 4 people, but it ended up only being Anna and me. I am happy with what we were able to accomplish in the 2 weeks we had, though I know both of us want to keep working to make it better! The project had a lot of new challenges, and I am confident when I say that we both learned a lot. Rachel, our client, has seemed very pleased with everything we have done, so I am happy with that as well. I appreciated the chance to work on this project!

*Feedback to Anna:*<br>
I loved the chance to work with Anna again! Though this project started with 4 people, I was happy that Anna and I ended up sticking with it. I know we both hope we can contine working on this project to make to even better, but I am also very happy with where we ended up. Anna is a super hard worker and always gets her work done. She was very communicative with me, and we were effectively able to divide and conquer much of the work. When there was a particular challenege, however, she was always willing to pair with me so we could figure it out. I really enjoyed this project with Anna and hope it's not the end of it!

*Feedback from Anna:*<br>
I was really happy to get to work with Megan again on the client pitch project. She is a really hard worker, and an easy person to work with. She is very flexible and open to ideas, and we were successful both in pairing and in splitting up work. I also appreciate that Megan is quick at working through problems, and she is always a good second set of eyes when bugs or frustrations come up. I hope we will get to continue work on our project in mod 4, because I know that the two of us can create a really wonderful finished product.


## D: Professional Skills

Many of the professional skills ramped up in this module. Though I know we are all getting intimidated by a lof of this, I've been trying to take each session very seriously as I know it will help me eventually.

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown
)

I unfortunately missed this Gear Up, as I was in Chicago for a funeral. :(

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This was a fun gear up. I liked that it focused on something we will have to actively consider on the job - effectively designing for users. The basic premise of journey mapping is identifying the "journey" the user will take while doing something (like using your software) and identifying opportunities and weaknesses of this journey in a timeline/map format.  We split into groups and tried it out, journey mapping both the experience of getting a new driver's license and completing your first Turing project. I will definitely take the lessons from this gear up with me as I move forward, and try to remember to consider the user's journey when designing any sofware.


#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

The last gear up of this module focused on grit. Though grit has become a bit of a buzzword, it is obviously an important quality. I particularly liked the article that noted the criticisms of grit,  where they said that grit only matters if it is coupled with passion. We talked a lot in my group about grit as a Turing student, which we all undoubtedly have. Much like the resistance gear up, however, we also talked about how it's important to reflect on grit inwardly and not focus on telling others to have more grit, as this can easily trend toward victim blaming. I liked doing this gear up in our cohorts and definitely appreciate the grit in myself throughout this whole experience!



### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/meganft/a07913d3f658c262c756e5f029891abf)

This was an exercise adapted from "What Color is Your Parachute", and it focused on taking inventory of what is most important to you and who you are. I enjoyed this exercise quite a bit, even though it took a good acount of time. You can see the summary of my efforts in the attached gist!

#### Job Search Strategies

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies.md)

We focused a lot on scheduling for the job search in this session, which made it both useful and intimidating. I implemented a job search schdule for myself this module, and I have tried to stick to it. I plan to focus even more on this through intermission week and into mod 4!


#### Innovative Problem Solving

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

This was a session with Allison where we focused on building creativity and new ways to approach problem solving. I didn't make a pitch after this session since I knew  I was hoping to work on the client project, and we were told it was uncessary if this was the case. However, it was still useful to go through the process of brainstorming and asking critical questions about our ideas.


#### Interviewing

* [Workshop URL]()

I really enjoyed this session. It was great to have an external speaker come in who is in charge of hiring. He was honest and clear in his suggestions, and I will always rememmber them.
See more information below!


#### Deliverables:
* Flower Exercist gist: https://gist.github.com/meganft/a07913d3f658c262c756e5f029891abf
* Interviews: I had one very casual technical interview with a friend in the industry. I had another one scheduled with a developer at my brother's company, but he had to reschedule for next week. I am planning to do 2 with him, and I also have another scheduled with Ian Douglas for intermission week. I also purchased a discounted account for Interview Cake and have been devoted to exercisms to prep for interviews.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Takeaway from my posse

I was again involved with the Bezos posse this module, and it was a great experience. I had more of a leadership role this module, and am planning to be and official leader next module. It was great to learn from the other students in our posse, particulary when we did sessions like user testing. We also had 3 guest speakers this module, but we had to reschedule 2 of them due to the snow. :( Last module, I asked my brother to come speak to us, and I think we will plan to ask him and a few more speakers to come next module as well. I appreciate being part of Bezos to get to know other entreprenurial minded students!
