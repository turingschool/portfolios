# Megan Talbot - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming from a non-progamming background, I hoped to come into this Module and gain a basic understanding of the fundamentals of ruby and object-oriented programming. I am happy to say that (even though it was incredibly challenging!), I believe I was able to accomplish that goal. Looking back at my projects from the entire module, I am pleased to see my progression. I know I have tons more to learn but I am thankful for everything that I have done so far!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the scores and summaries of my individual projects while in module 1.

### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beats used the logic of a linked list to build a drum sound-making program from our terminal.  I was able to make it through iteration 6 on this one, and was pleased with my end project. It was, however, very challenging for me and I would have ideally liked to progress futher than I did. 

* Solid testing, would like to have seen it go further in depth, and some additional edge case testing.
* Used iterative approach.
* All iterations complete.
* Code separated well.


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques




### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event Reporter is a project that focued on working with csv files, cleaning data, and running a program with an interactive REPL.  I also made it through this progress but wish I had time to add more.  The REPL was functional and the files were all parsed correctly per the spec.

* 32 tests, 48 assertions
* good separation of logic
* uses a hash to store info, but understands the need for a model


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 7. HTML and Style
* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.




### C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects



#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma was our first paired project, in which we had to encrypt a file, decrypt it, and then crack a message without a key as well.  We got all of these elements to work, but we had one element(decrypt) that we could have broken apart into smaller methods. 

* 13 tests, all passing
* A bit of overuse of instance variables, think about methods sending messages
* Enigma is doing a lot, break out functionality to perhaps a rotator class.
* Some very long methods.
* Enigma class does way too much.

#### 1. Overall Functionality
* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

*Feedback from Erin*

Megan, right off the bat we seemed to work really well together and at a similar pace. You were very open, honest, and communicative throughout the entire project. One area of improvement would be a little more planning at the beginning of the project. We both sort of just jumped right in and had a little trouble later on in the project due to the lack of planning. Thankfully, you were such a receptive partner and we realized this shortcoming and were able to start to adjust course mid-project. Overall this project experience was very positive and collaborating with you was very easy to do. Thanks for being awesome! 

*Feedback to Erin*

Erin was my first partner in a paired project, and I was so happy to work with her. She was very communicative and flexible. She was great at checking in with me to see how I was feeling about our progress. We both could have done more whiteboarding and planning ahead, but we realized that quickly! Overall, Erin was an excellent partner and I was happy to work with her. (to Erin Pintozzi)




#### Head_Count

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/headcount)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Headcount is a project that had us load and organize large data sets.  We accessed statewide public education information to analyze trends. In order to do so, we built structures to organize, hold, and assess these data sets in this project. 

Notes:
* test suite -  48 tests, 57 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97%
* test harness - 1 error, 1 failure
* uses #each a lot where there are better choices for enumerables
* generally good separation of responsibilities, but some refactoring could still be used
* some repetition, but 3am sucks


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation
The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
* 4: Zero complaints


*Feedback from Brad*

I appreciate that we did a DTR and established the ways in which we best work together. It seems as though neither of us are divide-and-conquer types, so I'm glad that we established as much and were able to find times to work together in person. You're extremely dedicated and hard-working, and I really enjoyed working with you on this project. As for advice, I'd just be careful that frustration over code doesn't inadvertenly get directed at your partner. At times I felt like I was upsetting you, but I think it was just general frustration with the project, which is completely normal.

*Feedback to Brad*

Brad was a very good partner. We established our team dynamic early, and I think we were able to stick to it. The project was very challenging, but I believe we were well matched. If I can give any advice, I would say Brad needs to work on expressing his thought process aloud rather than thinking to himself. It was very hard to tell what he was thinking because he tends to process inwardly first. This made it hard for me as a partner, because I ended up feeling silly asking the questions so often and having to push for that conversation. Other than that, good work!




## D: Professional Skills

A big part of Turing has been the emphasis of professional skills in addition to technical ones. We have had the chance to learn from different instructors about these professional skills, and my recaps of those are below. 

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This gear-up focused on the ability to get better at difficult things. It was interesting to hear about the research examples of making problems smaller as a way to make bigger problems easier. I liked that idea and have done my best to take it with me throughout the module. It's been hard to rememeber that doing difficult things, and being comfortable with being uncomfortable, is the new norm for me, but it nice to know that is a common and even useful feeling.  It was also really interesting to learn about the idea of cognitive drain, and how worrying about a problem is a way to drain your cognitive resources, which are limited and should be focused on problem solving.


### Gear Up
#### There is an "I" in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

Focusing on team dynamics, this gear-up was increibly relevant for Turing. I particularly enjoyed the talk from Dr. Brene Brown about empathy in team dynamics. I have always been very empathatic and finally started seeing that as an asset after her talk.  But I also learned that empathy without boudaries is not helpful. Which is why our DTR talks are so imporatnt. I have done a DTR with my partners almost every day since we started, and I often this back on this gear-up when doing so.


### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I really enjoyed this gear-up and the following discussion. The movie was very effective. I left feeling both encouraged about where the industry is going and disapointed about the persistent issues pertaning to gender in tech. There were parts of it that will stick with me for many years to come.  My favorite new example of why diversity is important is that air bags used to kill people because everyone who created them were white men of similar stature. 
I was also very happy to have an open discussion after (in group 2 - "I've had issues like those in the movie") with other women who have experienced similar issues, as well as men who wanted to hear more about said issues.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dp9f0ndeI2N3OzkTNMWbVJafjLAu5mw0thXJHusWois/edit?usp=sharing)

At the beginning of this module, I didn't realize how important learning to pair would be. I also didn't realize how much of my leanring would center upon pairing! This session was helpful in discussing the central protocols for pairing. But it was also helpful for learning how to effectively DTR - "Define the Relationship." At the beginning of this workshop, I wondered if some of the questions would be redundant or unnecessary, but I have learned that this is not the case and it's very important to DTR in every pairing. Above is my linked DTR for my final paired project in this module.


#### Personal Branding Part 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills#personal-branding-1)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-talbot)

I really enjoyed the Personal Branding workshops. The first one focused on how we will begin to rebrand ourselves in our careers as software developers. As a result of this, I began prelimilary changes on my LinkedIn profile (linked above).  Thre rest of my deliverables (updated resume and LinkedIn) will be complete by the second week in module 2, per instructions. The already compelted changes to LinkedIn include updating my title to "Software Developer", ensuring I had a profile picture, and getting a personal url link.  I learned that these small changes are very impactful to future employers, and will be the first of many steps to propely brand myself. 


#### Personal Branding Part 2

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p2.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q56X-uyVCnzrCBdcgD-kt7P_8HTN2YkjB9n6pHrKH2k/edit?usp=sharing)

Our second personal branding workshop focused on the continuation of how we will shape our brand.  We began the discussion of personal websites, and we also spent time brainstorming our summaries for LinkedIn (linked above).  I am still working on articulaing the three main questions that are a part of my summary, but I know this will be a work in process throughout Turing and beyond. I was happy to get a jump on it in this workshop and will make sure to keep this part of the curriculum as a priority. 




#### StrengthsFinder

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UCofBnp2bVTU76cveHz8aCGKxj9J0lnbmeZd48nnxwY/edit?usp=sharing)

I was happy to participate in the Strengths Finder in my first weeks at Turing.  My top 5 strenghts were Intellection, Empathy, Input, Learner and Individualization. I was surprised at some of my results, but was also expecting some. I particularly liked the depth of the feedback provided to me. To me, this seemed like a more accurate personality test than most. The small group discussion was also interesting, particularly in the areas in which some of us overlapped. 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Ali has been an incredibly supportive teammate and companion for me throughout all of Mod 1. I'm so happy to have her around for her positive outlook and kind words. We've spent time talking through challenging problems together, and I know I can always go to her when I get it all confused in my head. It's been great getting to know her and I'm thankful to be her classmate. (to Ali Schlereth)

Anna and I connected right away. I was so happy to have her as a companion throughout all of Mod 1. I say she works fast, but it's because she works so hard on everything she does!  At the same time, Anna is super willing to talk through anything with me. A great sounding board and supportive teammate, I'm glad to have Anna around and know she contributes immensely to our cohort. (to Anna Dolan)

Dan was my partner as an SAB rep this module, and I couldn't have asked for a better teammate. He was always around to bounce ideas off of, and he was supportive of any idea of mine. I will miss him next module! But I know he will be a huge asset to his new classmates, just as he was to us. (to Dan Olson)

### Being a Community Member

Megan has been a joy to work with. She is easy to collaborate with and a hard worker. I've appreciated both her technical and emotional support during these last 6 weeks. I really like how we can talk through an idea and implement it in our own way, then follow through and support each other. (from Ali Schlereth)

Megan was the first person I connected with at Turing, and she has continued to be helpful and kind throughout the module. She is a great collaborator, and we have worked through problems on individual projects together. She is someone I have always been able to be open with on all kinds of topics, and she is a valuable person to have in the cohort. (from Anna Dolan).

Megan and I were partners for SAB. She was so creative and proactive in all aspects of our responsibilities. She was always open to new ideas and gave constructive critisism were needed. She will be awesome as a continuing represenative in mod 2. (from Dan Olson)





### Playing a Part

I was happy to be a SAB member this module, where I represented our cohort on the Student Advisory Board. We were in charge of gathering feedback and monitoring Turing culture within our cohort, and I really enjoyed being a part of it.  I also joined the Bezos posse, where I participated in weekly posse meetings focuing on entrepreneurship.  

Being able to play a part of the larger community at Turing has been one of the highlights for me.  I enjoyed getting to know students from other cohorts, as well as staff that teach other modules.  SAB meetings always felt useful, and I was glad to be part of larger discussions at Turing, such as those about effective communication, feeling safe, and social events!  The Bezos posse showed me that other students are increeibly smart, entrepreneurial and thoughtful.  I left those meetings consistenly impresed with the calibur of the Turing community.
