# Vido Seaver - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came into this module with mixed feelings, it was difficult seeing my peers from 1606 move on without me. My goal was try to play more active roll helping others this time around and that was pretty rewarding. I wouldn't say it was a breeze this time but I've defintely been comfortable. I look at it as a polishing module, not as much new content, more time to explore and to teach others.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:
* GREAT testing: Developed need for `stock` test immediately, used tests to build that functionality
* With "What Can I Make" challenge, identified need for `cookbook` immediately and tested that before moving to `add_to_cookbook` method
* Solid choices around best-choice Ruby syntax. Ex: `Hash.new(0)`
* Marked improvement in building functionality and testing incrementally
* Best first-stab at enumerable _I've ever seen_

## Rubric
Students will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

### Notes
#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

#### 2. Completion and Progress
* 4: Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Event-Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

At the end of last mod I learned the importance of putting in work on the weekends. I had friends in town and didn't put in the work on event-reporter I should have. I built my repl for it at four am morning off. I got it done but not how I had wanted to. Honestly the project wasn't where I wanted it to be.

#### 1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. REPL Interface
4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty

#### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

#### 7. HTML and Style
4: Uses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

#### Complete-Me

I really enjoyed this project, we crushed it. Ali is wicked smart and really easy to work with. I think we finished it with two days to spare.

#### Assessed By:
Beth

#### Notes:

Base expectations complete plus 1 extension
Solid testing suite with unit and integrations tests
Intentional division of responsibilities between classes AND methods; demonstrates thoughtful design and sound implementation of that design
Ruby style: some small issues that held project back from "demonstrates excellent knowledge of" style, but overall relatively clean and stylistically consistent project. Nice job!
Only had use for two enumerables, chosen appropriately. Project's execution doesn't lend itself to a 4 in this category.
Only bug: count continues to increment with duplicate words. Does not affect trie structure.

#### 1. Functional Expectations

4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Feedback from Ali:

As my partner in my first paired project, Vido set high expectations for future pairing. Throughout our project Vido showed high levels of respect and communication. He calmly described his thinking and reasoning when asked and asked the same of me. He was diligent about working ahead of schedule to give plenty of time for refactoring and reduce overall stress. Vido could benefit from focusing on these strengths in times of stress as sometimes his tone of voice gets the better of him. I'd gladly work with Vido on future projects.

#### Feedback from Anthony

Vido was fantastic to work during our final Headcount project. I learned so much from him as he has a really great understanding of the concepts and depth of material. I liked how honest he wanted me to be with him about what I though of his working style and communication. Outside of our project he was always willing to drop what he was doing to come over an explain an concept that I had trouble understanding.

### Professional Developement

I attended all of the gear ups, and spike classes. Particpated in the conversations, went to a couple things during the during startup week and attended some meetups. 

### Community

"Vido is one of the top if not the top student in this cohort. In addition to whatever is required under conventional Turing Module 1 program, he usually comes up with pretty sleek and mind-blowing solutions to coding problems his peers have never seen before. Whenever I was stuck in my projects or other exercises he was there to help. He takes his time to explain  what is going on under the hood and it is great to pair up with him to tackle a coding challenge. All in all, I think Vido is a valuable asset to Turing community." -- Alisher

### Giving Feedback

Anthony is a pretty quick guy, he definitely made this project more tolerable, he was open to putting in long hours and he kept a great sense of humor  and attitude for the entirety of it. There wasn't really much I would say he needs to improve on -  I think the logic comes at its own pace and with our group dynamic I ended up doing the majority of the navigating. I think maybe pushing to be the navigator would help build those skills more quickly however its not something I would say influenced our project in a negative way.


So, Ali’s going to have to get some constructive criticism from someone else cause I got is good to things. She sharp as a whip, creative, flexible and easy to work with. One of the top in our class if not the top. Our project was so easy it felt like cheating. I guess the only thing I would say is she might worry to much about doing everything perfectly. I doubt its an issue though.

I was kind of suprised when Alisher asked for some feedback.
I don't feel like I've worked enough with him to really speak one way or the other on his code.  I think repeating has done him well and really solidified concepts. From what I understand he's a G when it comes to testing which makes sense because he strikes me as being pretty process oriented.  This can be a strength or a weakness depending on the situation.
### Professional Developement
The first gear up of the mod we watched a video about cognitive resources. I really liked it because it it broached some topics of learning -  specific examples i remember where training people to sex chickens. The was overall theme was about effective learning patterns and energy use. 

The second gear up was about buying in and we and a discussion about faith or ghosts or something, our team was kinda of disjointed and epitomized what i think what the gear up was getting at - which was how hard it is to function well if everyone hasn’t bought in.

The last gear up we watched the Bridging the gender gap movie. I took some issue with the naming over the groups because one in particular had quite a negative connotation to it. Ultimately i joined the “i’m interested how do i not be part of the problem group”. That movie did a great job at making feel like a terrible person. I think the thing that stuck with me the most was the “death by a thousand paper cuts” line and how easy it is to be careless and contribute to the issues that others face.

### Being a Community Member

I did mad dishes, went to all the productivity lunches, took part in the the Armstrong Posse, made myself constantly available to my peers and went to a couple meetups.
