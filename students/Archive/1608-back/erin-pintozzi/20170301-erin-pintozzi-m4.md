# Erin Pintozzi - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had a primary goal with the overarching goal of passing Module 4 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1, 2, & 3 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. This goal strongly ties in with the Community graduation requirement as well, and there was quite a bit of overlap. I will strive do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Volunteer as a pre-work guide
* Led a Friday Spike on Project Management
* Co-led a workshop for the Women in STEM series
* Joined the "Pairing" channel to find new opportunities to help "younger" mods be successful at Turing (and then paired with People)
* Blog/document my personal project process (in progress)
* Joined several meetup groups in Los Angeles to begin my networking before I move

[Hot Reads](https://github.com/epintozzi/hot_links_final)

Notes:

- Good work. You pushed through.

## Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 6. Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

### 7. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following individual projects were not completed as a group/partnership but rather as an individual effort.

The purpose of this project is to submit to an open source project to make positive contributions to the programmer community. I chose to contribute to a Gitlab gem. Further details about the project are linked above in my blog post.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following projects were completed as a group/partnership.

#### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self is a application that tracks exercise and meal calories for each day to help users achieve a healthier life.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

* Tracker indicates all expected features are delivered
* user experience is pretty solid
* Day navigation and persistence works
* Log stays accurate with changes, edits, deletions
* Testing looks really good
* Look out for little things like target/verify based on CSS classes rather than specific values
* Experiment with dynamic ID generation in your view rendering to allow for targeting on identity rather than hierarchy (nth-child)
* JavaScript implementation style is beautiful
* Good job isolating the ugly/unpleasant parts and keeping them away from the good stuff

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

### Feedback
Quantified Self was my second project with Erin, and I have to say it's always been great to work with her. Erin consistently kept the project on track, especially with Pivotal Tracker(which I kept ignoring). Her time management skills helped us time-box issues that we were stuck on, which in turn helped us move on with the project so that we would never really be behind. Erin was also able to pick up JavaScript fairly quickly and was using ES6 syntax and writing shared functions by the end. I also had a great learning experience when Erin took over the user experience side of the project and lead the styling session. Overall, I think Erin has the skills to work in either front-end or back-end environment, and her management skills will be valuable to any project. - Daniel Shin

##### Jeff Comments:
* Problem: too much free time, opportunity to hone skills, be better developers
* Get two solutions from the same exercise on Code of Arms
* PLEASE DON'T TYPE "LKHJGSDFG" IN YOUR DEMOS!
* Tracker: good progress, some stories in the backlog, add some filtering
* Shame: Showing Sal a thing that didn't work, turned out to just have Pry
* Proud: use of the Code of Arms API, neat to build other things
* Improved the CoA API to allow the functionality
* "How do you see the comments?" "`rails c`"

##### Nate Comments:
* I like the consistent style with code of arms
* It seems like a good start, but a lot of the "sticky" functionality is yet to come



## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills sessions are an integral part of our Turing program because we are learning skills that are very industry specific for our soon-to-be new careers. This includes both examining how we are presenting ourselves to those on the outside as well as personal reflections to make sure we are striving to be the best versions of ourselves.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

My biggest takeaway from this session was the idea that we define "likeness" wrong. 100% (or close to it) of people at Turing are "like me" because we all quit our jobs to come learn to code. We all like solving problems. I don't think "like me" is as one dimensional as gender or skin tone. That said I realize that things like gender, race, orientation are the types of things that tend to lead toward this type of segregation. I think a lot of that is based in ignorance and fear. If we all tried to find "like" things in each other, I bet we'd be surprised.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

My big takeaway from this session was thinking about what automation means for me, my peers, and my neighbors (aka "the world"). It reminds me of the book _Player Piano_ by Vonnegut. The hardest question to answer, to me, isn't about income, it's "what happens when there's nothing I can do to contribute to society?" One of the biggest reasons I came to Turing is that I wanted a better challenge in my career and for myself and my growth. If there isn't a job for me or anyone, what do we do? How do we stay challenged and remain interested in anything? Money is the least of my worries. What a horrible boring life to have no purpose.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I had some fairly inconclusive takeaways from this session. I don't think it's a novel idea. It's just another variation of welfare (which I do think is necessary and generally good). I think another solution, and probably better one, is figuring out how to provide "necessities" for less: healthcare, housing, and food. And frankly, I don't think it's a one or the other. Why not try and marry both of those ideas together? Once topic that came up was the "freeloading" of people who won't work because they don't have to. I think that misses the point. I think everyone should have a right to basic necessities. My taxes are what they are because I had the privilege and opportunity to go to school and get a job that I like. Taxes are necessary for many things, including helping our neighbors, and I don't feel bad about that.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Professional Development Deliverables

*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1608-b/erin_pintozzi.md)

#### Strengthsfinder session
* [Link to Session](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/strengths_finder/mod4_strengthsfinder_small_group.md)

Vision Statement: In the next year, I will pursue my career goal of moving out of a junior role in to a non-junior role and begin/continue preparing myself for a team lead position in the future. By using my deliberative and discipline strengths,  I will channel my energy in to finding opportunities, avoiding pitfalls, and learning continuously.

How I'll achieve this: 	
* Practice being comfortable in my shoes. I feel like I'm growing out of my imposter syndrome here but I'm not confident that that'll stick with me in to the job, especially in a field where it seems women kind of get the short end of the stick sometimes. If I want to make it to a team lead position I will need to practice being a leader, having opinions and healthy disagreements in addition to just making valuable code contributions.
* To get there I can:
	* Cold outreach
	* Give lightning talks or a talk at a meetup
	* Go to meetups and just get to know people; I don't think my "practice" has to be limited to my work team
		* This will also help me learn about new potential opportunities in case a shift to team lead doesn't exist at my first company
	* Write a blog or anything that helps me feel confident and authoritative on a technical subject
	* I would like to support my cohort-mates however they need it. Everyone is different so what sounds like good support to me may not be the same for someone else.
		* I would love to someday be the person that introduces someone to their new awesome job because of the network I've been able to build


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Anna:
This is my fifth project with Anna while here at Turing. It's been an interesting experience to be able to grow and learn together over the last 7 months in a much deeper capacity than most of my other peers. Anna is smart and confident and can solve any problem. Even when she gets frustrated, she's so good at using that energy to find answers and not give up. She arguably holds herself to a higher standard than anyone else I've paired with during my time here at Turing and whoever she works with in the future will be lucky to have her on their team.


Nick:
I really enjoyed working with Nick on the capstone project. I tend to be pretty conservative and pick options that feel a little clearer or more comfortable. Nick is fearless. The webhook he implemented is so cool and something I probably wouldn't have had to courage to tackle myself. I have literally never hear him utter the words "I can't" and that is why he is going to be such a strong asset to whichever team he joins after Turing.


Noah:
Noah was a great teammate during the capstone. He has a great enthusiasm and imagination for coming up for creative solutions to problems and ideas for features of the app.  Our app implemented some new tools and techniques that we learned throughout the mod because Noah had so much excitement for experimentation.


Daniel:
This is my second project with Daniel (first was Headcount in mod 1). I've enjoyed being able to come full circle on this particular pairing because I remember in mod 1 it took a couple days for us to find a workflow and pace, and this time I think we hit a better groove, and much faster. Daniel has such a strong work ethic and rocked all the javascript. Not only that, but he's a really great teacher. I definitely felt a big struggle learning javascript but Daniel's explanations got me up to speed much faster than if I'd continued to suffer on my own to the point that we were even able to divide some tasks to do solo which I really liked because it helped me feel more confident in my javascript skills. Daniel would frequently pause to make sure I understood what was happening in the project for the pieces that were confusing to me. He'll be a great asset to any team, and I imagine also a great mentor to other developers he works with as he continues to grow and learn.


### Being a Community Member

Code of Arms was one of many projects I've worked on with Erin, and I was excited to be in a group with her again. As always, she contributed a ton of great code, along with skillful project management (even though she wasn't technically our PM). She was always very understanding and flexible with group members, and it helped to keep the tone pleasant and upbeat. Erin is really talented, and I am excited to see what she accomplishes after Turing! - Anna Dolan

I feel fortunate to have been able to work with Erin on our capstone project. As a group we wound up doing a lot of our work separately, and Erin would not only come in every day with problems solved and great code written, but with ideas for how to improve features while staying within the scope of the project. (!) The skills she brings from her "previous life" also came in super handy - graphic design for our hella great shield logo, project management for our project... management. Looking forward to seeing where her career takes her! - Noah Berman

It was great working with you this module. Your ability to organize your thoughts, schedule tasks and assist in delegating responsibility is invaluable to any team. You remained calm and collected throughout the stress of the module and that helped keep everyone's emotions in check. Working with you on any team would be a pleasure. - Nick Martinez

Quantified Self was my second project with Erin, and I have to say it's always been great to work with her. Erin consistently kept the project on track, especially with Pivotal Tracker(which I kept ignoring). Her time management skills helped us time-box issues that we were stuck on, which in turn helped us move on with the project so that we would never really be behind.

### Notes (From Nate)

I really appreciate the attitude you've had throughout this module. Your classmates were expressing a lot of stress and it seemed like a struggle for them to see the bright side. I also appreciate you speaking up when you felt that it was time to have a conversation. That had a real impact on us and your classmates.


- Although there wasn't too much individual work, your group projects both shined. Your QS scores are great, and I love the start you guys made on Code of Arms. It shows real craftsmanship.
- I'm sorry I missed your spike. These capstone projects are reminding me how much I appreciate good project management.
- On top of your contributions to your cohort, you've made a real impact on both our internal community, and the broader tech community. According to you, this was outside of your comfort zone. Well, I hope you continue the trend. I'm so glad you've chosen to join the tech industry. Go do awesome things.
