# Erin Pintozzi - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had a primary goal with the overarching goal of passing Module 3 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1 & 2 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. I will strive do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Volunteer as a prework guide
* Gave a 'product pitch' in Bezos
* Attended "meet the CEO" sessions with Bezos
* Planned to attend Women Who Code meetup (cancelled due to weather, rescheduled for February)
* Sign up for Demo Night (terrifying!)
* Blog/document my personal project (in progress)

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

Consuming API:
- Only 10 stores showing on homepage
- Hashes in view
- Service started with no spec behind it - be cautious of this work style. Always remember, red, green, refactor.
- Feature test is strong

Providing API:
- CRD functionality tested
- Good implementation of serializer
- Good catch of `protect_from_forgery`

Overall:
- Just shy of where we would hope this would land. TDDing the Service call and creating Store objects

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills sessions are an integral part of our Turing program because we are learning skills that are very industry specific for our soon-to-be new careers. This includes both examining how we are presenting ourselves to those on the outside as well as personal reflections to make sure we are striving to be the best versions of ourselves.

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Aggressions

Though slightly controversial, this was an interesting session. I think Micro-Aggressions are one of those things that is easy to ignore and pretend like it doesn't exist, so keeping it in mind as a lens through which I make observations and decisions will benefit me and those around me as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

The journey mapping session was interesting because it focuses on the big reason why I am here: providing a great solution to a problem. Using journey mapping will help ensure that whatever that solution is, is focused on the problem from the perspective of the user and should ultimately result in better projects.

#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

My takeaways from this session were thinking about what really engages and interests me, and how I can use that to my benefit in the future. For example, I can make sure I speak up when appropriate during projects to ensure I have to chance to work on my learning goals. I know I like working on well-planned projects with solid UX so that user's enjoy the end product and that can be a driver as I move forward in Turing and my career.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Turing Alumni Portfolio

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://www.turing.io/alumni/erin-pintozzi)

#### Personal Project Pitch

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

##### Deliverable
### Tuesdates
### Pitch
Tuesdates is an app the helps friends organize "dinner dates" using the Yelp api to make recommendations and then send out the "date" information to everyone in the group.
### Problem
• History: I used to be a part of a group of 4 people, who, every Tuesday would go to dinner. We alternated who would pick the restaurant. That person had to send an email with the details. I added the restaurant to a google doc for tracking, and we also used google calendar events to remind the "picker" that it was their turn. It worked but was messy. This app will consolidate all those steps in one place
### Solution
An easy to use app that reminds and alerts group members about dinner/event details and keeps a log of past events for the group.
### Target Audience
• Audience 20-30-somethings who are looking to spice up their Tuesdays (or any day) while exploring new restaurants in town
• We know growth of the demographic is booming in Denver
• We know the Denver restaurant growth has also boomed
	○ 300 new restaurants opened in 2014
	○ 200 new restaurants opened in 2015
	○ In 2015, for the first time ever, consumers spent more on restaurants than groceries
• I imagine this applies to other cities as well
### Integrations
* Which APIs will you use?
	* Yelp to generate restaurant list
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
  * Google


My big takeaway from this session was how to effectively brain storm. I went in with an idea for a project, but was able to better flesh out the details so I could execute a well-thought out project.

#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/epintozzi/6bfc0141293b39fa82f1d6d0e991235e)

The takeaways from this session were to really think about what's most influential and important to me as I grow. Some things will be deal breakers in life/career and others won't and it's important to differentiate between the two.


#### Mock Interviews

2 mock interviews are due for portfolio review with a third due by 1/23

My first mock interview was with Sam, a team lead of Reverb in Chicago. It didn't go quite as well as I'd hoped- I felt pretty nervous so stumbled a little over my answers. My biggest take-away is that I need to get more comfortable talking through my process and it would serve me well to work on some practice technical interview problems so I feel less anxious during interview.

My second interview was with Fred, a technical manager of Riot in Los Angeles. I expected this one to go better than the first, however since Fred is a hiring manager (whereas Sam was a team leader but not responsible for hiring), the interview felt a little different, and again, my nerves were at play. I think the practice is helpful because hopefully it will make the pressure feel more "normal" so that when a real interview comes, I'm ready.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### Anna Dolan
Working with Anna is always a treat. Anna is passionate about her work, contributes thoughtful and helpful ideas, and is very thorough. Our group had some tension about mid-way through the project and rather than just stifling the issue, Anna was very direct, but kind in bringing up the issue so the group could work on addressing it together. I know that can be a very difficult thing for a lot of people to do, but Anna seems like a natural when dealing with difficult situations and we were able to navigate the problem as a group.

##### Jon Kimble
Jon is a great group partner. He is so easy going and determined. Jon took on some very challenging tasks which he saw through to completion. Jon has a great gauge for knowing when to ask for help and when to keep digging. He also is very even-keeled which proved to be very helpful when our group hit a point of tension. I learned a lot working with Jon and I think our project was much better for it.


##### Vido Seaver
I had the opportunity to work with Vido twice this module on Cloney Island and Rales Engine. One of the best parts about working with Vido was his willingness to talk about progress, problems, and successes. Vido helped our group make sure we stayed on track with our regular stand-ups to check progress and the "temperature" of the group. Vido values team work and pairing and works really hard to ensure positive working relationships are maintained.

### Being a Community Member

I have worked with Erin several times over my time at Turing,  and she always is a treat to work with. She was the project manager for our group on Inspiration, and she kept us on track and kept our user stories clear. When I had some issues with another group member, she was very understanding and helped me to keep calm and continue working. I have been lucky to work with Erin as much as I have, but I would still love to work with her again! **- Anna Dolan**

Erin was a fantastic person to work on S.A.B. and for our cloney island group project.  Erin's strong organization skills were invaluable and really sped up our whole work flow.  In addition to these organizational skills Erin's ability to work with others and handle issues that arise is outstanding and a huge asset.  It was great working with Erin this mod and I look forward to the opportunity to work together again! **- Jon Kimble**


I had the pleasure of working with Erin on two projects this mod. She is self-aware, empathetic, hard working and well organized. Because of her amazing organization skills she makes for a great project manager.  I don’t really haven't any complaints working with her. If there is an area i think she could improve I would say it would probably be to be more  “in charge” as a the manager and trust in her skills and judgement **- Vido Seaver**

### Playing a Part

One of the most meaningful contributions that I think I've made is that I was an SAB rep this mod. I think it's important to my cohort-mates as well as to myself that we all seriously consider how to improve the Turing community and I'm able to directly affect that in my role as an SAB representative.

I've also been an active participant in the Bezos posse. I've participated in a couple of activities which made me uncomfortable (in a good way) and I think helped me grow as well as the other Bezos posse members. This mod we did some practice pitching which was really helpful both for practicing public speaking as well as fleshing out my idea for my personal project. Second, we did user test which again helped me practice public speaking. The other great part of both these activities is that we were able to practice giving and receiving feedback on our performance, projects, and ideas in real time.
