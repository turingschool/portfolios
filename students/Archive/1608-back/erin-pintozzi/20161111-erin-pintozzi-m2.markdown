# Erin Pintozzi - Module 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had two primary goals, both with the overarching goal of passing Module 2 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal 1 - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. I will do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Led 11 pairing sessions with Mod 1 students
* Volunteer as a prework guide
* Gave a 'product pitch' in Bezos
* Attended Meet 'n Greet with GoSpotCheck
* Volunteered as Try Turing TA
* Attend Boulder Ruby meetup

#### Goal 2 - Work on leadership/support skills
The purpose of this goal is to build my leadership and support skills within the Turing network to be a better student/peer as well as to hone my professional skills. I will earn at least 3 “points” per week. Points can be earned by: participating in class in a meaningful way, meeting someone new, being a pair for another student, meeting with a mentor, volunteering in the greater community (ex: at a meetup), and asking for or offering help. This list may be updated over time as I become aware of different opportunities.

##### Result
Given the large number of points, I chose not to itemize each accomplishment on my google doc, however in summary here are some things I did regularly to make sure I was an active part of the Turing community:
* Attending pairing sessions
* Attend Joan Clark Society Coffee meetings weekly
* Participate in Bezos posse
* Participate in class regularly by answering/asking questions and always being in attendance and on time

##### 5. Rails Style

 * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

##### 6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following individual projects were not completed as a group/partnership but rather as an individual effort.

#### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/mix_master)
* [Link to App](https://quiet-citadel-99160.herokuapp.com/artists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

In this project, I made a web app to create artists, songs, and playlists. The biggest takeaways from this project were learning how to create one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, deploying to Heroku for the first time, using RSpec, Capybara, and FactoryGirl for testing, practice git workflow, and practice using Rails.

##### Ungraded Assignment

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/job-tracker)
* [Link to App](https://radiant-chamber-96469.herokuapp.com/dashboard)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/epintozzi/job-tracker/blob/master/README.md)

The Job Tracker project is a web app to keeping track of companies, jobs, contact information, and comments for jobs I am interesting in applying to. The biggest take-aways and learning goals were to practice Rails and CRUD, practice keeping logic in the appropriate places, styling/basic UX, testing with RSpec, Capybara, and FactoryGirl, and practicing with routes/nested routes.

##### 1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

##### 2. Routes

* 4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

##### 3. Controllers

* 2: Significant logic exists in the controllers. Methods may be more complicated than necessary. Most functionality is still supported.

##### 4. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

##### 5. Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

##### 6. User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

##### 7. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/usts)
* [Link to App](https://radiant-chamber-96469.herokuapp.com/dashboard)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

For the my Rails Mini-Project, I chose Option 4, a self-designed project. I decided to try and re-build some of the major pieces of functionality of my boat race club's website. It was a fun challenge and gave me a good idea of the complexities that "simple" sites have. User's of my app are able to create accounts, and users can register for races. Admins have the ability to create and edit races and the classes that participate in each race, whereas users can only view this information. The primary learning goals of this project were to practice authentication and authorization, deployment, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, styling, Rails conventions and best practices.

##### Ungraded Assignment

#### Blog Post - Project Management Strategies for Developers

* [URL](https://epintozzi.github.io/2016/11/07/project-management-strategies-for-developers.html)

##### Description

This post outlines 4 project-management-inspired strategies for developers (including a list of tools) to help get the job done right the first time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
The following projects were completed as a group/partnership.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush hour is a Google Analytics-like app the can load user data and provide stat results and calculations for various websites which reports things like the source of traffic, pages visited, and browser. This project was written in Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord with learning goals to practice builing an app following the MVC framework, practice with databases and how they store data, learn of HTTP verbs, practice with SQL and ActiveRecord, and practice styling techniques.

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

##### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

##### Feedback to me
* Anna: Erin was the Project Manager for my Rush Hour group, and she contributed enormously to the success of our project. Erin made sure that our team stayed on constant communication throughout the project, and kept us on track using Waffle. She also had a large part in the productive and happy group dynamic that we were able to maintain throughout the project. I look forward to continuing to work with her on future projects.

* Alisher: Erin was great in many aspects during the Rush Hour project. As a Project Manager, she took care of her project management tasks in an excellent manner.  We were always on the same page since everything was written out by her on our waffle cards which were being constantly updated. On the other hand, she worked hard on different components of the project and  did a great job solving some problems needed to complete the required functionality. I can recall a specific instance when I was supposed to work on something in the morning but she took care of it overnight and I got extra couple hours of sleep. So I look forward to working with Erin again.


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/root_and_branch)
* [Link to App](https://root-and-branch.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This Little Shop project is an e-commerce store/app written in Ruby/Rails with ActiveRecord. The store is called Root and Branch and sells socially responsible goods. The learning goals for this project include continued practice of Rails and the MVC framework, extracting logic to the appropriate places, styling, ActiveRecord and database relationships, authentication/authorization, TDD with RSpec and Capybara through the build of the app, and practicing git/agile workflow with a team of 4.

##### Feedback Activity

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills sessions are an integral part of our Turing program because we are learning skills that are very industry specific for our soon-to-be new careers. This includes both examining how we are presenting ourselves to those on the outside as well as personal reflections to make sure we are striving to be the best versions of ourselves.

### Gear Up
#### Voting

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this session we discussed voting- whether or not we should as citizens as well as how we find information and choose sources we trust. I wasn't much looking forward to this one, to be honest because I really don't like discuss politics in public. That said, my group had some great insight about places to find good information as well as brought up the important point that while the presidential election is the most talked about and publicized, voting in state and local elections will have a greater impact on my day to day life. I am a voter, but it was definitely a point that I hadn't thought about in terms of its importance before.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

In this session we talked a lot about how introverts and extroverts behave in various social scenarios but specifically at school and work. Some big take-aways were that both "types" are important and bring balance to social situations because each tends to approach social situations differently. We also talked about how Turing can better support introverts. I'm actually not sure we came out of the discussion with many actionable items, but it did remind that that I think Turing DOES try to support all types of students, and I'm sure finding the balance is challenging.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

In this session, I think I learned a better/psychological definition of "resilient". I think some of it just innate though agree with the main article that it can be learned, and we aren't all just stuck one way for the rest of our lives. I also think that what the article calls resilience is probably more in line with how I'd personally define courage- responding to hard things in the right way. I'm not sure how I previously defined resilience- perhaps it had a little more negative connotation. Courage is doing the RIGHT this or the best thing when challenges are presented and Resilience is just not avoiding the challenge or giving up on it- but it doesn't mean the response a person takes is the best/right choice. I think the biggest take-away and thing that I can keep working on is how I frame challenges that I face and to remember that it is very rare that things happen TO me. The world is not against me, and only I can choose how I respond and feel about the situations I encounter.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
##### Deliverables:

* PM strategies you used in projects: Strategies that work well include setting clear expectations from the get-go (and updating them regularly/as-needed), having pen & honest communication, and daily standups to check progress. Things that can make team projects more challenger include not determining roles in advance so everyone knows what they should be working on or who to ask if questions come up.
* I've incorporated feedback from the last project by trying to act as more of a leader and volunteering to "drive" while pairing rather than being a more passive voice. This has helped me individually and my contribution to the group because I feel like I'm learning more and have valuable things to offer to my team.

#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpiAsaYxx20s_DA7cb8cwWdG7Du8vK3REZ68hgAjbAg/edit?usp=sharing)

In this session we discussed avenues for finding jobs that interest us and techniques for finding contact information for developers at those companies. Some of the websites recommended for job search include builtin and muse. LinkedIn and Github are good sources for trying to find contact information.


#### Cold Outreach

* [Workshop URL]()
* Deliverables: Cold email one contact on the list linked above

In this session we learned tips for structuring good cold outreach email including keeping them relatively short at 3-5 sentences, having a specific ask (like to meet at a certain date/time for coffee), and a short intro/connection between yourself and the person you're emailing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* Phyllis, I've really enjoyed pairing with you throughout this module. It's been really fun to experience all the things you're learning each week and to practice those skills with you. You do a great job of working through drills and tasks and knowing what things you'd like to work on when we pair to make good use of the time. You give code your full attention and thought to really understand why things happen the way they do which is a wonderful skill to keep practicing. I'm confident that with time you'll be flying through those drills because I've seen you learn so much over the last 6 weeks.

* Ali, working with you has been a lot of fun and I've learned tons. I think we have a similar style of how we approach programming so working with you also felt very natural and easy. Your note-keeping, precision, and thoughtfulness toward our approach resulted in our group attaining higher quality project that I'm super proud of. Keep practicing not letting perfection drive out the good. You write great code and are awesome at refactoring, so I know this is something that you will easily keep improving while you knock out great projects.

* Megan, what a great surprise to have the opportunity to together again on a group project. First off, I think we did sooo much better with the planning and workflow that we struggled with in Mod 1. You  make intentional decisions that help us get code right the first time, and you also have a persistence to help keep the team's head up and get things done. I'm sure you experienced moments of frustration, but honestly, it never really showed which is an unbelievable quality to have on a team and one that I think would make you an excellent team leader.

* Anna, it was really exciting the be able to work with you a second time this mod. I am so glad you took the lead as our product designer. Our Little Shop looks awesome and you rock at styling. I also think it's pretty cool to see how much more confident in the MVC type framework you've become for solving problems, debugging, and testing. I think you're going to keep rocking these skills as we continue to learn more.


### Being a Community Member

* Erin Pintozzi has been a stalwart pair partner for me throughout module 1.  She consistently sacrificed her lunch break so she could assist me with course material.  
Calm, patient and incredibly focused we painstakingly worked through drills and course material until I got it.  She has an easy way of breaking down complex principles into their smallest components.  We have paired a great many times throughout the module, with an open invitation to work on the material more in depth at anytime.  She is always  enthusiastic and eager to impart what she knows.  I once mixed up schedules and left her hanging, unperturbed she just arranged for another session later in the week.  I am so grateful for all she has given me by way of teaching. - Phyllis Hugunien

* Erin was such a great partner in this module. We worked together on Little Shop, and she was our fearless project manager. I learned a lot watching her work and am so glad for that opportunity. We were also both in the Bezos possee, and I again was glad to have the chance to learn from her. She is always willing to offer her opinion but also super open to hearing from other people. I will miss working with her on Little Shop, but I'm glad that we will have the chance to still work together in other ways in the future! - Megan Talbot

* Erin was in my Little Shop group, and acted as the Project Manager. She kept us organized and on task, while at the same time being very open to ideas presented by group members. She worked very hard to keep us organized on Waffle while also putting in a ton of work on our code. I have worked with Erin twice this module, and I think that a presence like hers is very important to productivity and general happiness in a group-work scenario. - Anna Dolan

* Erin has been a wonderful partner and classmate. During our group project, she had a highly collaborative temperment. I enjoyed talking through strategies and ideas, putting our thoughts together for great outcomes. I learned a lot about creating a solid web app and thinking through design for user experience. I really appreciated how you stood up for your opinions while also being open to other ideas, it made finding compromises an ease. - Ali Schlereth

### Playing a Part

This module I tried really hard to play a positive role in the Turing community as specified in my goals at the beginning of this portfolio. One of the most meaningful activities was pairing with Mod 1 students. This was really enjoyable and helped me continue to practice Ruby. I also liked being able to get to know the Mod 1 students, especially those I got to pair with more than once. It was so cool seeing how quickly they learned since I was in their shoes just 6 weeks ago. It was a really fun experience.

Another really awesome experience was volunteering for a Try Turing event. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It was SO COOL to see a class led just like the ones Turing students attend every day. I wish this had been a thing when I was looking because I think it would've really taken away a lot of my anxiousness about quitting my job and moving across the country to do this. It sounds like we find some great students through this program, and I so excited I got to be a part of one of these sessions.

Last, I participate in the Bezos posse. This mod, we practiced giving pitching for (imaginary) products, learned about User Testing and even did user testing with each other on our own apps (which was so awesome and helpful), and we had a meet 'n greet session with the CEO of GoSpotCheck to learn about his path to founding his own company. The leadership of this posse has been thoughtful and has provided me a lot of great practice and resources for while I'm a student here and after I graduate.
