# Ali Schlereth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Before coming to Turing, I taught in the primary grades at a number of schools.
After discovering the level of creativity, puzzle logic, and organization in
writing code, I became passionate about combining these interests so as to
impact the educational technology sector and have fun doing it!

#### Date_Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date_Night utilizes a Binary Search Tree, where each movie is given a score, stored as a Node. Further functionality 
is added as analysis layers.

###### Comments:
* TDD implemented and used effectively  
* Solid test coverage  
* Reflects sound understanding of principles (SRP, BST)  
* Syntax- and style-wise: some small refactoring needed, some long methods  

###### Scores:
3: Application fulfills all base expectations  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques 

#### Event_Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alischlereth/event_reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event_Reporter focuses on consuming a CSV, cleaning the data, and storing information in accessible ways. This program is run though a REPL and has the ability to print to the command line, create new CSVs, and create HTML documents.

###### Comments:
* 39 tests, tests all pass, however, the REPL starts in the testing.
* All functionality works. No extensions done.
* FILE IO should be in a separate class
* Used ERB.
* HTML Looks good. There is a table.
* Some classes do a bit much
* Don't print in the help file, puts at the outer most layer
* Think about what can be pulled out of a class in terms of functionality.
* Really liked how there was an attendee class. 

###### Scores:
3: Application fulfills all base expectations
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques  
3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.  

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Complete_Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Complete_Me examines the use of a trie, where an auto complete tool is built. Each letter is a Node with multiple branches of child nodes. In addition, there are analysis tools built in to impact the return result from selecting a word from the suggested options. 

###### Comments:
* Base expectations complete plus 1 extension
* Solid testing suite with unit and integrations tests
* Intentional division of responsibilities between classes AND methods; demonstrates thoughtful design and sound       implementation of that design
* Ruby style: some small issues that held project back from "demonstrates excellent knowledge of" style, but overall relatively clean and stylistically consistent project. Nice job!
* Only had use for two enumerables, chosen appropriately. Project's execution doesn't lend itself to a 4 in this category.
* Only bug: count continues to increment with duplicate words. Does not affect trie structure.

###### Scores:
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension  
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data  
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods  

###### Feedback from Vido:  
So, Aliâ€™s going to have to get some constructive criticism from someone else cause all I got is good things. She's sharp as a whip, creative, flexible and easy to work with. One of the top in our class if not the top. Our project was so easy it felt like cheating. I guess the only thing I would say is she might worry to much about doing everything perfectly. I doubt its an issue though.

###### Feedback for Vido:
As my partner in my first paired project, Vido set high expectations for future pairing. Throughout our project Vido showed high levels of respect and communication. He calmly described his thinking and reasoning when asked and asked the same of me. He was diligent about working ahead of schedule to give plenty of time for refactoring and reduce overall stress. Vido could benefit from focusing on these strengths in times of stress as sometimes his tone of voice gets the better of him. I'd gladly work with Vido on future projects.  

#### Head_Count

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Headcount focuses on loading and organizing large data sets. In this project we use statewide public education data including attendance, graduation rates, testing, and economic statistics. Storage structures and relationships are built as well as tools to analyze performance statewide and by district. 

###### Comments:
* 139 tests   
* 100 percent coverage  
* spec harness passes  
* Iteration 5  
* No extensions  
* There were sad path tests  
* Look into how you can use enumerables to make tests more robust.  
* Overall code was well written and organized well with some small areas where there could be some refactoring for clarity. 
* Some of the math could be pulled out into modules to bring class size down.  

###### Scores:
3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 as well as one of Iterations 5 or 6  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality  
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods  
4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
Turing staff lead us in reflection and discussion around how to improve our soft skills such as respectful clear communication, personal branding, and being a reflective learner.  

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This session was a great discussion. Our group talked a lot about how to celebrate the little successes and not get beaten back by the regular day to day struggle. Much of this inspired by Ta-Nehisi Coates' article. 

#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

Here we watched a video about setting boundaries and creating a dynamic within a group which is supportive of everyone's voice. We discussed experiences in our lives which had lead to successful team dynamics. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I really enjoyed the documentary. It did a nice job of giving information without sensationalizing the issue. I heard some others say that it was playing the victim, but I didnt feel that way. I joined the discussion on wanting to be part of solving the problem within the industry. My group had a really good discussion where it seemed like everyone shared their genuine thoughts and reactions. My biggest surprise was how many of my male group members didn't have any ideas about how they could make a positive impact in regards to gender issues in the technology field.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair w/ Allison

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)

Allison led our small group in a reflection exercise in which we looked at each of our strengths and analyzed how they could be a challenge in our life as well as how they could benefit us. I enjoyed taking the time to reflect on where I see these strengths in my life. It was also interesting to see who else shared one of my strengths and hearing how they percieved their strengths.  

#### Personal Branding Part 2 w/ Lia

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p2.md)

Lia worked with students to create a personal summary with a cohesive message.  She also covered making a personal website. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback to Anna:
Anna has been a great collaboration partner and source of support this module.  I appreciate that she is willing and eager to give and recieve ideas and strategies. She has really intuitive ideas and is a quick worker. I think she would benefit if she trusted her instincts even more. 

###### Feedback to Megan:
Megan has been a joy to work with. She is easy to collaborate with and a hard worker. I've appreciated both her technical and emotional support during these last 6 weeks. I really like how we can talk through an idea and implement it in our own way, then follow through and support each other.

###### Feedback to Erin:
I have enjoyed collaborating with Erin this module. Whenever asked, she readily offers ideas and advice. She has been a supportive community member; I know I can reach out to her if needed. I would love to hear more of her insights and ideas, don't be afraid to reach out and speak up! 

###### Feedback to Brandon:
Early in the module, Brandon reached out for a social gathering, which I deeply appreciated as I was surrounded by strangers. Since then, he has also reached out for skills support. I appreciate his genuine interest in truly understanding the content, and not just looking for answers. He is a pleasure to work with.

###### Feedback to Joey:
Joey is one of our strongest students, with both technical skill as well as collabortion and support. He often has a strong sense of how to successfully solve a problem or where to look for more information. Additionally, he has always been receptive to questions and eager to help find solutions. I greatly appreciated his patience when I was working by myself and needed to bounce ideas off of or ask questions of a peer. Thank you for such friendly reliable support!

### Being a Community Member

###### Feedback from Anna:  
Ali has been supportive since the beginning of the module. We have been able to discuss all kinds of issues openly, and we have met up outside of class time to work on individual projects together. Ali is quick at grasping the concepts we have covered this module, and always willing to pass them on to people who may not have understood it as deeply their first time hearing it.

###### Feedback from Megan:  
Ali has been an incredibly supportive teammate and companion for me throughout all of Mod 1. I'm so happy to have her around for her positive outlook and kind words. We've spent time talking through challenging problems together, and I know I can always go to her when I get it all confused in my head. It's been great getting to know her and I'm thankful to be her classmate.

###### Feedback from Erin:
Ali, am really grateful that you are a part of our cohort. You exude a lot of confidence, rationalize your choices well, and always seem to have time to help , no matter how much work we have on our plates. I admire the gusto with which you approach problems. I remember a few weeks back during a Friday guest speaker and we were grouped together to work on solving a design problem, and you made a comment to me along the lines of "thanks for taking one for the team" in reference to presenting our idea in the microphone because you and Megan didn't really want to. I remember feeling so surprised when you said that because from my perspective, you are so confident and smart. So with that context in mind,  I hope you trust in your gut and know that I really value hearing the things you have to contribute and would never feel like I'm "taking one for the team" when I'm working with you. You have wondering things to offer our cohort and the Turing community.  

###### Feedback from Joey:   
Ali, it's been great collaborating with you this module. You've become a go to person for me when I have a question about code or just in general. If you can't answer "what are we supposed to be doing?" I assume that no one can. So thanks for being there. Your positive attitude is always a refreshing break from work.    

###### Feedback from Brandon:
Ali is a great programmer to be around. She presents the type of 
attitude that makes people around her want to get better by always displaying 
relentlessness in solving problems on her own while maintining a positive demenor 
under pressure. As an inferior coder compared to her, I'd always feel comfortable
asking her for help because she would go out of her way to help
me while she had deadlines of her own and would take additional time to reiterate
what we had just went over to make sure I understood what was going on. These 
qualities in Ali not only showed me where I needed to improve, but also inspired 
me to be able to help the next student in the same way.

### Playing a Part
###### Posses
I joined the Pahlka Posse, taking part in planning our current project, taken advantage of pairing opportunities, and attended community building lunches.   

###### Cohort Culture  
A few weeks before classes began, I organized a get together to meet other members of our cohort. I have worked with peers in my own mod who have reached out and helped support a collaborative supportive environment in class as well as initiating meeting up to work on weekends. I joined other members of my cohort on activities outside of the school week such as hiking.
