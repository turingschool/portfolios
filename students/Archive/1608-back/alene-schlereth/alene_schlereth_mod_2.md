## B: Individual Work & Projects

Follow are my individual outcomes from thie module. Included are a blog post as well as graded and ungraded projects. 

#### Blog Post    

* [Blog Post on SRP](https://alischlereth.github.io/2016/10/30/single_responsiblity_and_the_spork.html) 


#### Job-Tracker

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/AliSchlereth/job-tracker
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

This project focuses on creating tables utilizing different data types and foreign keys, creating routes, utilizing MVC with restful routes and CRUD functionality. In addition, this project practices ActiveRecord managing relationships and queries to the database.

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.  
3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.  
3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.  
3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.  
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.  
3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.  
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features  

I really appreciated this project for building my confidence. Having a starter repo to build off of created some support to look back upon and rely on. It also asked us to create a large amount of functionality on our own. 

### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

For Rails Mini Project, I created an Idea Box with the intention of creating a resource for educators to use in find diverse images to align with lessons and units. I really enjoyed getting to put my own context on this project as it further increased my enthusiasm for what I was creating.    
My biggest learning take aways from this project surrounded user authorization and authentication. It was also helpful to have to create a project from the very beginning all by myself. It strengthen my confidence in my skills as a Rails Developer.   

#### Mix-Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix-Master was half tutorial half independent work. I really enjoyed the opportunity to still have some guidance while also getting more experience creating functionality and tests independently. This was a great opportunity to challenge myself but still have easy access to modeled work so as to anaylze where my my growth points were.   
This project helped me become more comfortable writing tests in RSpec and Capybara.  Additionall, it was good exposure to new types of forms and database relationships.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are the group projects from this module - Rush Hour and Little Shop. 

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/root_and_branch) (http://root-and-branch.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This project builds an online ordering platform. Customers should be able to place orders and view placed order details. The site owner should be able to manage products and categories in addition to processing and completing orders.

I appreciated building out a usable web application. During this project, I learned a lot about using sessions as well as styling using modified bootstrap. My team was a great resource, everyone working with perserverence and contributing invaluably to the group. 

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This project uses Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool similar to a Google Analytics. A relational (Postgres) database is created where clients have payloads of information, accessible through a web based user interface.  

(None submitted)

3: Application fulfills base expectations  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.  
4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers. 
3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.  

Feedback From Mike:  
Ali was a great teammate.  She was completely dedicated to the success of the project. She was open to discussing ideas, had a large contribution, and was willing to take on tasks as needed.  Specifically, she kept us organized and took on the waffle cards when they had fallen to the wayside.  Dicsussing ideas with her was easy, as she learns quickly and is unafraid to challenge new ideas.  One opportunity (that I think will come with time/comfort with the material) would be to split more work in order to struggle with the some of the problems we encountered.  

Feedback From Nick:  
Ali was a great teammate and excellent communicator. She is open with feedback and provides effective and accurate critical evaluation of both the project and her teammates. Disagreeing with Ali on certain aspects of the project was a pleasure. She was easy to talk to and always constructive. The best feedback I could give Ali would be to be aware of the time spent on what may be trivial issues in regard to the scope of the project. It was a pleasure working with Ali throughout the project and I would recommend her as a teammate to anyone.

## D: Professional Skills
Following are the reflections from Gear Up and Professional Development sessions. 

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

Coming in to this gear up, I anticipated a lot of talk about 'grit', which as a buzz word personally leaves something to be desired. However, I was pleasantly surpised by some research on resiliance and personal reflection time.  I enjoyed the conversation with a smaller group of cross-cohort members. It was interesting to hear how folks saw this applying from a mod4 member to mod1 members. 

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this session we read about and discussed the rights and responsibilities as a citizen followed by reading, reflection, and discussion about voting and political leadership. The general consensus of the group was that many young adults are frustrated by the current functioning of the political system, but that we need to participate in the system in order to make it better.  

#### Introversion and Extroversion in Teams

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

We had a great discussion about the virtures of introversion and extroversion. I enjoyed talking with my group mates about our experiences. Many of us fell in the same space of seeming extroverted but feeling more introverted. Some of our time was spent discussion how this impacts our time at Turing, especially in group works. One of personal revelations was about who teams of three are much easier than partners since you always have to engage when in a partnership but in a trio there is a chance for one person to pull back and be quiet.  

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Finding Opportunities w/ Lia

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11yQhtJAWuGWcWMuqgRX-Qae4xaaKwh6uD4kKZRe2y44/edit#gid=0)

Lia walked us through some strategies relating to making connections and building our professional network. Some of my top take aways were:  
* on utilizing Meetup attendence lists in conjunction with LinkedIn to find people 
* looking at the current and past jobs of someone on LinkedIn to determine if they have similar work interests as well as broadening my knowledge of the possible companies I'd like to work with  
* ideas what to talk to someone about during a networking coffee meeting 

#### Collaborative Communication w/ Allison

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/collaborative-communication.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DihxGGvsKfy1zRrZfoVGYnzyFXFzv2J64h6qSGZjquw/edit?usp=sharing)

This session we talked about how to address someone when they've made significant mistakes and how to share responsibility within a team setting.  During our group discussion, we reviewed the goals and pathways to collaborative group work with respectul communication and mutual accountability.

Megan is a hard working insightful individual. She has an attention to detail and always willing to collaborate. Throughout the entire module, I always knew that I could go to Megan as a resource for both technical as well as emotional support. This was also true in our Little Shop project. She does a great job voicing her opinion while also listening to others. I appreciate when she pushes back on others' suggestions when she has a differing opinion. She is comfortable giving something a try and perservering until it works, and works well. Thank you for your leadership and support!   


### Being a Community Member  

From Noah:  
Ali's leadership of Pahlka Posse has really pushed us forward as a group. She is able to keep us on track while still making sure everyone's opinions get heard, which is no mean feat. We wound up rewriting a huge chunk of a project in JS/Node and she jumped in and picked up a ton of the syntax/concepts really quickly, making serious progress towards bringing a suite of other apps together as one main game/app. Her willingness to just get things done has not only served Pahlka well but will surely serve her well in the post-Turing world!

From Tommasina:  
Ali has been a dedicated leader of Pahlka Posse this mod. She's coordinated our meeting times, locations, and agendas and has helped keep us on track with timing during these meetings. She's facilitated Saturday work parties, and lead our group through its first iteration of our master canvas for our healthy eating game, even as she was just learning JavaScript. Her sense of efficiency, fairness, and dedication to working towards a greater good have made her an inspiring leader within our group.  

From Erin:  
Ali, working with you has been a lot of fun and I've learned tons. I think we have a similar style of how we approach programming so working with you also felt very natural and easy. Your note-keeping, precision, and thoughtfulness toward our approach resulted in our group attaining higher quality project that I'm super proud of. Keep practicing not letting perfection drive out the good. You write great code and are awesome at refactoring, so I know this is something that you will easily keep improving while you knock out great projects.  

From Megan:   
Ali was, as always, a great partner for me this module. We got the chance to work together on Little Shop, and I was very grateful for that opportunity. Ali is always supportive and willing to hear different opinions. At the same time, she is eager to help with anything. I will miss working on a project with her, but am so glad that we were able to do that at least once! And I know she will continue to be as supportive as always going forward.

From Anna:  
Ali was a part of my Little Shop group this module, and this was my first time working in a group with her. Ali was very dedicated to the project and excited at small victories. She helped to keep us motivated and contributed to a happy group dynamic. She also put in a ton of work on the project, and made really important contributions to our code. I look forward to working with her in the future, whether in a group or on an individual project.  

### Playing a Part

Pahlka Posse:    
* Posse Leader  
As a posse leader I facilitated time management of meetings and utilized structure to involve both ongoing Pahlka members as well as weekly drop in visitors on Fridays.  
We made forward progress building a game with nested games inside of it.   
* My favorite part   
This module I was able to work with a group refactoring JavaScript, explore Node.js and gain some experience with WebPack. I've really enjoyed transferring my knowledge of Ruby to JS.  
* Personal Growth  
As a member of a posse, I have grown in two main areas.
1. Managing group dynamics between peers. Finding the balance between efficiency and dynamic discussion.
1. Diving into a new language and new frameworks. I'm loving learning new tech skills!
