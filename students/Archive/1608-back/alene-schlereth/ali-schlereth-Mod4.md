### Projects

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/quantify-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

A Calorie Tracker - Food/Exercise built in JavaScript. This application utilizes localStorage to hold information across multiple days for multiple meals. 

17 tests, all feature tests, all passing.
Would like to have seen some sad path testing
Opportunity to refactor with code duplication in Diary.
Fully functional, no bugs.

3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect  
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.  
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.    
3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.   
3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature  
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories  

#### Census Sprint 1 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/census)
* [Original Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t2I-o1-D3d_Q8M-hYouJbC7ExBwo_MvAwN2J8W5JNls/edit?usp=sharing)

Census is a data management system and OAuth provider for the Turing Community.  This sprint involved Admin management of Roles/Groups and their assignment to users, adding some API endpoints, cleaning up permissions, and some general debugging. 

Overall really pleased with project.
Great levels of communication.
Project Documentation A+++++++ would read again.

4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.  
4: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner and laid out future stories.  
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.  
3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.  

#### Census Sprint 2  
All stories and bugs completed.
Good documentation.
Code generally well written and well factored.  

4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.  
3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.  
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.  
3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.  
3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application  

#### Yearbook  
Notes from Nate:  
- I like the planning for the future. The settings screen.
- Looks like you're handling at least a few edge cases, like students that haven't uploaded at picture. But not images that are the wrong aspect ratio...
- Yearbook is for Jeff
- Looks clean    

Notes from Jeff:  
* Pulls information from Census
* Start Game -> Select a Cohort -> Guessing
* Scoped out the robots / people without
* Tracker: good
* Census: added a few routes before starting Yearbook
* "Discovered" that really only one person can play the game at a time
* Lots of extra controllers
* Conclusion: start from scratch
* Proud: "I added some tests"

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tradgedy of the Commons 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really liked the triangle/square exercise. There was someone in my group who disagreed with the idea of affirmative action, we had a nice respectful conversation. It was great to explore action steps from another point of view.

#### Automation and the Future 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation is likely inevitable. It was interesting to hear how different people thought about what it means for the future. There were a couple folks in my group/room who were fairly outspoken about a couple set ideas, which hindered conversation a bit.   

#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

There are lots of complexities here. We discussed what this would look like across the country with such a variance in cost of living. We also discussed how some of the options in laying it out would not in the end fix income inequality and poverty. It was also important to think about what happens if people are out of work, how does this impact their self worth.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

to Noah:  
Noah has done a great job leading Pahlka for a second inning. I really appreciated his perserverance in making sure we had solid Spike content/plans and rallying the troops each week when so many of us didn't have the energy. Thank you for your enthusiasm and dedication. Pahlka for life! (Also, yay Pahlka twitter account!)  
  
to Nick:   
As always, Nick has been a great contributor to Pahlk Posse. He is reliably present to the group and willing to share of his ideas and energy. He showed great leadership this inning, leading a technical spike on Leaflet as well as a networking/mentor spike with Horace where he lead a great conversation. He took the time to do outside background work to make the session a success during wk5 which is never easy. Thanks Nick!    

to Ben:  
Ben was a great partner. Coming in to Quantified Self, he was eager to learn all about JavaScript. We quickly hit an onboarding pattern of setting out a prototype (not the JS kind) and then he recreated it to help himself solidify the knowledge. Ben was determined to find solutions and a diligent worker. I think he would benefit from giving himself a bit more time to figure things out before seeking outside help. He was a great collaborator who listened as much as he spoke. Ben made for a great learning partner!  

to Brad:  
Brad was a great team member, especially for a four week project. I enjoyed diving into building universal search functionality together and was impressed with your research skills while we were trying to figure out SAML.  Thanks for being a great collaborator with dedication.   

to Joey:  
Joey was a great team member throughout our 5 week project span. I enjoyed collaborating and learning new tricks. It helped work flow and team dynamics a great deal to split apart functionality and know that we could rely on each other to produce quality. Thanks! 

### Being a Community Member

from Ben:     
Ali is an amazing partner. Her grasp of JQuery and Javascript is stunning. She made Quantified Self far more tolerable and her enthusiasm when something finally worked was refreshing. Ali is more than capable as a programer and as a member of any team that she has been or will be a part of.    

from Jon:   
Ali was a huge asset to the Turing community and all our time at Turing. She is an incredibly hard worker with a level head who has always gone far out of her way to support her classmates.  She has both strong techincal and personal skills that makek her an outstanding developer and teammate. In addition I think she has a strong moral compass which will lead her to meaningful and impactful work in the future, I'm really excited to see what she gets up to in the future and SO glad that she was a part of our mod.  Thanks Ali for always being awesome and supporting those arround you!  Best of luck in the future and if you ever need anything feel free to reach out!    

from Joey:     
Ali, it has been great working with you on Census and throughout Turing. I admire your organization and dedication to quality work. You pushed me to do some testing and refactoring that I probably wouldn't have done on my own and I appreciate that. It's a shame that we never had the chance to work together on a more exciting project. I think that would have been a lot of fun.  

from Brad:  
Positive: You're always happy to answer questions. You explain your thought process super clearly, and I learned a lot from pairing with you.
Constructive: Don't be afraid to be more assertive. I think taking a project manager role would be a good challenge, and I bet you'd be really good at it.  

from Nick Chambers:  
Ali has been one of the core members of the Pahlka posse during my time at Turing, and it's been a pleasure getting to know her. She's always been an organizer, a leader and a solid contributor. Pahlka will surely suffer without her around, and wherever she ends up working will be lucky to have her. Great job over the past seven months. It's been awesome getting to know her.  

### Playing a Part  

Pahlka Posse:
* Efforts toward Pahlka Posse continuing after the current four Mod4 folks graduate. We revamped a bit of how Spikes and our weekly lunch work to be more inclusive and build relationships. Personally this mod, I focused on stepping back as a leader and supporting the current leaders to ensure Pahlka's continued success. 
* Continued to build out Edualize's backend.  We built a PDF scraper, loaded it into a DB and built an API endpoint for our frontend (and anyone else who finds it and wants to use some state by state school funding data) team to use in a React Leaflet app.  

Community Engagement:  
* Supported fellow Pahlka students through pairing. Taught one frontend group about SQL - creating, inserting, selecting, etc and how to access it.
* Lead a spike on Intro to Civic tech, describing Civic Tech and sharing resources. Exploring current projects out there. Discussed what makes a quality data source (tricky subject w/ lots of opinions)
