# Dave Junta - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to establish myself in the fundamentals of Ruby, Git and terminal navigation in order to have a solid base for future development.

 2. Completion and Progress
* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

 6. Enumerable & Collections

## B: Individual Work & Projects
My four Mod 1 projects were Jungle Beats, Enigma, Event Reporter, and Headcount.
#### Jungle Beats
* https://github.com/dijital2016/jungle_beats
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown

"In this project we're going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, we're going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let's also use this project as a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List."

#### Enigma

* https://github.com/annadolan/enigma
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

"The goal of this project is to write code for an encryption algorithm that shifts letters based on a random 5-digit key and an offset derived from the date. Additionally, the goal is to crack the code based on the final characters of any input being "..end..".

This code enables the user to encrypt a message from a text file to another text file, and decypher or crack the encrypted text and write the result to another file. The "Enigma" class can also be run through a Pry session, taking various numbers of arguments for each method."

#### Event Reporter

* https://github.com/dijital2016/Event-Reporter
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown

"Let's take EventManager to the next level. Based on the same data file, build an interactive query and reporting tool which fulfills the expectations below. Re-use data cleaning procedures from the original EventManager to handle dirty input and generate beautiful output. We are also going to explore creating our own HTML files and using an API."

From Anna Dolan --  "David was my pair on the first paired project of the module, Enigma. Our pairing was difficult because we worked at very different speeds and had difficulty accomodating this. We also planned during our DTR to "divide and conquer" on much of the project, which turned out to be very difficut to do due to the nature of the project. However, we maintained a rapport throughout the project and never had a serious disagreement about how to proceed. Dave was always kind and very open to changes in code or suggestions about the direction we should take."

#### Headcount

* https://github.com/dijital2016/headcount
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Project Description
"Learning Goals

Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software"


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### "Getting Better At Difficult Things"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

--This talk covered a number of hacks for improving efficiency and productivity.  She talked about the importance of working harder and smarter rather than just longer.

### Gear Up
#### "There is an "I" in "Team""

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

--Dr. Brene Brown talked about vulnerability and the role of the individual's willingness to be vulnerable as it relates to the success of a team.  The small group discussion was great, as we had only Calaway and Marcella and myself.

### Gear Up
#### "The Gender Gap in Technology"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

--Especially as a father of three girls, I really enjoyed "Code: Debugging the Gender Gap".  Again, we had a great group discussion in which people talked about ways women experience discrimination and how they deal with it.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Personal Branding)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/personal-branding.pdf)

--Lia was great educating us about the modern technology career world including the use of LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, personal websites and resumes.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

--To Nick Martinez
"Nick was my partner for the Headcount project.  He had a great attitude throughout a very tough project.  One of his biggest strengths is the ability to keep trying new approaches when obstacles appeared.  Even in those times, he was always able to keep things light and fun while working diligently and collaboratively to power through and find a solution."

--To Susi Irwin--
"Susi has been an amazing presence at Turing for a lot of people in Mod 1, especially in the Imposters group.  She brings a humility and warmth to a program that can feel, despite all the great people, quite brutal.  Her sharing of her own experiences, both good and bad, has been a great source of support for fellow Imposters like myself.  Lastly, Iâ€™m always amazed but not surprised how everyone, even those not in Imposters, seems to know and love her."

### Getting Feedback

--From Nick Martinez--
"David is an excellent work partner and provides consistent feed back. Our work together was productive and efficient. David is great at bouncing ideas around and working toward a common goal. David is a great communicator and very professional. He managed the stress of a very difficult project well and was a blast to work with. I would enjoy working with David on projects in the future."

### Being a Community Member

I look forward to becoming a more active part of the community in the future, something which has been tough while "drinking from a fire hose" in Mod 1.

### Playing a Part

I really enjoyed being a part of the Imposters group and the Hopper posse.

## Final Review

### Notes
* Dip in individual project scores toward the end. 
* Pair projects, continue to work on interpersonal strategies for dealing with conflict 
* Some concerns with Event Reporter and Headcount responses. Due Wednesday at 9:00 AM. 

### Outcome
PROVISIONAL PASS (contingent on finishing Headcount)
