***Areas of Emphasis***
* My goal for Mod 3 is to improve on my ruby syntax and explore area where I was previously hesitant. I would also like to become comfortable with consuming, rendering and testing api's. On the professional side of things, I would like to more aggressively start reaching out to hiring managers and set up meetings over the mod break.

### Projects

***Rails Engine***

[Github Link](https://github.com/antciccone/rails_engine)

***Description***
* The goal of Rails Engine was to use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which will expose SalesEngine data. We were able to build out single responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API. We also used complex ActiveRecord queries to pull out data for our user.

***Grade***
  Completion

3+: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec

 Test-Driven Development

4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

 Code Quality

4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

 API Design

4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

 Queries

4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

***Feedback***
* From Anna - Anthony was my partner on Rails Engine, and he was great to pair with. He did a great job keeping the mood relaxed, and we accomplished a lot. Anthony is a super hard worker, and we had no trouble splitting tasks and getting all of the work done. I look forward to working with him again!

***API Curious***

[Github Link](https://github.com/antciccone/api_curious)

***Description***
* The goal of API Curious was to learn to consume data from third-party APIs. In this case I used Oauth for github and replicated a user's homepage.


***Cloney Island***

[Github Link](https://github.com/antciccone/cloney-island)

***Description***
* Vicarious.li is a delightful little web-app designed to do one thing and one thing only: make your dreams a reality via the magic of crowdfunding. It was a A ruby on rails web app storing data in a PostgreSQL database. Hosted on AWS EC2 with HTTPS provided by the beautiful folks at Let's Encrypt. Some images come from unsplash, but custom ones are handled with a mix of Paperclip + AWS S3. The site is styled via heavily modified bootstrap and some custom jQuery/Ajax magic.

***Feedback From Team***
* From Ben - Anthony was yet again a thrill to work with. His persistence in not only wanting to get the basics requirements done but also styling a beautiful page was impressive. Anthony is an incredibility versatile coder and it shows in everything he touches. We were pairing near the end and I could tell that when he is looking at HTML code he is actually seeing the page as it will be rendered. I am in awe of that ability.

* From Lee - I love your excellent work ethic, you definitely put in the time on cloney-island. Working together closely on the project was a great experience. One suggestion for improvement would be to not be discouraged on a really tough problem, but keep beating on the wall. I really appreciate all the care you put into the styling and overall had an excellent project experience with you

* From Noah - I enjoyed working with Anthony on Cloney Island! He especially took charge of our front-end content and the site wouldnâ€™t have looked anywhere near as good without him. He is calm under pressure and is always willing to try new approaches to problems. This was my first time working with Anthony on a project but hopefully not the last!

***Jam***

[Github Link](https://github.com/antciccone/jam)

***Description***
* Jam was my two week long personal project where I used Spotify Oauth to gain access to a users playlist data. I was able to pull their top tracks and top artists through spotify api calls. Depending on their top listened to artists I would pull concerts from the bands in town api depending on their location. I would also display recommended concerts who share similar traits to their favorite artists.

***Grades***
* Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

- Really good use of AJAX with search results
- Spotify/Spotify Oauth, BandsInTown, Google Maps, SendGrid APIs all used
- UX/design is super clean
- Caching could be implemented to speed up API calls

***Posse***
* Turing Lab: This was Turing Lab's first go around and I can say I really enjoyed it. Mixing the code we learn with hardware was a great learning opportunity. This was my first time playing with an arduino and I can say my group and I did some interesting things with it. I am excited to see where Turing Lab will go once the 3D printer start working.

***Reflection from Gear Ups***

* Grit - I enjoyed the grit discussion in particular because it was just with our mod which I think makes people feel more comfortable. I think our mod as a whole had a really positive talk about what grit means to them.
* Micro-Aggression - This was my favorite gear up of the mod because of the particular articles provided and the group discussions I had. Someone in our group talked about every time you see a micro-aggression you should perform a micro-service(do something good for someone else)
* Journey Mapping - The question my group chose to talk about what 'How did you make your decision to come to Turing ?" It was fun hearing and understanding others' experiences on their situation and a great way to practice asking the right questions.


***My Feedback***

* Feedback to Anna - This was my first time being in a project with Anna and it was a great experience. I liked how honest and straight forward you were when working together which really helped clarify and set expectations. Anna was super hard working and also completed most of the really hard ActiveRecord Quieres. One suggestion for improvement would be if you doing a project/interview and your are on a time limit or you donâ€™t know the answer for example try not to express/show you stressed even if you are inside. I really appreciated all the hardwork and time you put into the project! Would love to work with Anna again.

* Feedback to Ben - I was pumped to hear that I was going to be in a group with Ben again. He is always willing to change and adapt to situations around him. Ben took on one of the hardest parts of the project which was working with Twillio. I also like how Ben wonâ€™t let something go until he understands the true why! I would love Ben to be in my group a 3rd time!

* Feedback to Lee - This was my first time working with Lee and I was really blown away by how he was able to talk about problems in a simple/understandable way. Lee and I paired on a majority of the project and it was awesome. I really enjoyed working with Lee because he helped me understand that I need to be more patient and to slow down. He does true TDD that helps you really understand the problem and make sure you are not making any mistakes.

* Feedback to Noah - This was my first time in a group with Noah and the experience was great. I was really impressed by his persistence to host our app on aws. I can not even count the amount of hours he put into getting it work, but at the end it was totally worth it. He also took alot of time with to add details to our project which I really appreciated. It was a pleasure working with Noah and I would love to work with him in the future.

***Professional Development***

* ***Flower Exercise***
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nzenitramwp/ACFlower.pdf

* ***Job Search Strategies***
 * I thought this along with Jesse's gear up talk really helped become more organized in my job search. I do believe I am doing a good job tracking and reaching out to hiring managers in NYC.
* ***Innovative Problem-Solving***
 * What is the problem? Describe it and what specially you/the client needs to solve?
   * I want to create a simple app that uses your Spotify data and your top artists and
    gives you concerts in your area as well as recommended concerts.
    * I plan on using Spotify's api as well as bands in towns api. I looked in the geocoder gem which will help me get a user's current location.
  * What led you to this point?
    * Spotify gives you concerts dates for artists but not grouped by your top artists. It also does not show you concerts depending on your location.
 * Target audience?
    * People who have a Spotify account and like to go to concerts!

* ***Interviewing***
*  12/22/16 with Andrew Thal - Senior Dev at 2U
 * How do you think Bit.ly works?

* 1/4/16 with Andrew Thal - Senior Dev at 2U
 * Parsing through a YAML file and making two tests past

* 1/9/16
 * Ian Douglas group interview session
