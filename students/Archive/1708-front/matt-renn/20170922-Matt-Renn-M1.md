I enjoyed working with you, Matt. Your understanding of JS was a big help in getting our project completed. I especially appreciated your diligence to get things accomplished quickly, even if that meant working long hours after class and on weekends. As a result, we kept the stress level down and were able to make the project on-spec but also unique to us. You were encouraging and easy to work with. I'd love to see you (and me too) slow down a bit at the start of a project and spend more time in the planning/architectural phase, to try to reduce potential snags that pop up along the way. I look forward to seeing you progress through Turing. Hopefully we'll end up working together again.

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rennmatthewp/ideaBox-mrtw)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Website that enables users to write and save ideas.

no search or up/down vote, filtering, or localStorage implemented
ideas are appended to the page
team embraced the struggle and didn't just pair their way through the project (ie didn't rely on peers or mentors to pull them through more features than they understood how to implement).
They worked together to focus on learning goals and understanding the code they wrote

Matt was a great partner for me. He had a step-by-step manner to his approach which worked well for me. His coaching was important to my learning for this project. His style of repetition and making me vocalize our steps was key to my understanding. Our communication and work time were on point. The fact that he was learning new things while coaching me was impressive and appreciated. He has room for improvement with his tendency to get frustrated and burned out. A solution to this would be more poms and a growth mindset, which would allow him to take a step back and view his work as progress instead of a problem. He should see how much he has improved during his time at Turing and how much more he can grow. Matt is a very patient teacher and great at coding; which made for a great pairing experience for me.

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rennmatthewp/2DoBox-MR-JP)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Refactor another groups ideabox codebase and make a to-do list style site.

Good work w/following: Nice work having no deep-nested if/else statements, removing anon functions that aren't necessary, and no global variables. YAY for ARIA!! Nice color button and UX touches (cursor changes and coloring for buttons). Love that you're using Waffle/issues for project management! Good naming for feature branches and commits.

Room for improvement w/following: Set properties of id, importance, and completed should be defaults in constructor. You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage or appending cards like in lines 63, 112, and 200 as any one unique card object should only be instantiated once. Lines 265-308 could be refactored into one single, dynamic function. Upvote/downvote could also be refactored into one dynamic function.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I hold the door open for everyone. I'm trying to encourage women in my community to come to Turing. I tried to help the rest of my cohort as much as possible. I ran the 1708-to-do channel to keep track of our deliverables.
