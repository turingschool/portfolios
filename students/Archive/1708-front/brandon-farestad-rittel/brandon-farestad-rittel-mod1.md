# Brandon Farestad-Rittel - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I hoped to get a much deeper understanding of what I knew about HTML and CSS, as well as get a soild grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript. I worked toward this by making sure all projects were completed to the best of my ability, and using the resources available outside of class time to improve. Additionally, I hoped to start building relationships within the Turing community to become a full contributing member.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

These were projects I worked on individually outside of class time. Number Guesser is the first JS project, while the static comps are all focused on HTML and CSS.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was the first JavaScript project. It required an input and submit that would register a guess of a random number between 1-100 and tell you if it was too low or too high. When the number was guessed, it would return BOOM!

Notes/What To Work On:

watch indentation -- Check your settings and make sure 1 tab = 2 spaces
good job on the comp, just a few details like spacing to keep an eye on
good work!

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/bfr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This was the first static comp, which required us to recreate the layout of a website using HTML and CSS. It was also the first time using Flex Box and responsive design. My project focused on Hank Hill, Assistant Manager Strickland Propane. 

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/bfr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project expanded on the usage of HTML and CSS, requiring us to build a more complicated layout. It had a card-style layout with different features within each card. It was more responsive than the previous project, and focused on a site where users could create a custom baseball team with player cards.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These were all JavaScript and jQuery projects completed in a paired project. I really enjoyed the paired projects as an opportunity to learn from different perspectives and work through things with others in the cohort.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was the first time using jQuery combined with JavaScript. It took the values from inputs and appended them to another section of the page. Users could save bookmarks to a list and mark them read or delete the links from the page.

Notes/What To Work On:

Team embraced the struggle, overcame speed-bumps and frustrations, and came out the other side with a good project.
good approaches for how they approached and worked through problems/struggles. Didn't just settle on first idea, pushed through to really understand the problem and weren't afraid to get rid of code that wasn't helping them and start fresh.
GOOD JOB!
code is ready for a refactor pass (which is a good place to be)

“Our linked-list project went really well. I appreciate your open communication and how we shared responsibilities on the project. It was also great for us to work side-by-side as much as we did since we’re both learning. There were times I noticed you were hesitant to share your thoughts out loud but you improved on that by the end of the project. Given that we are all learning, be sure to always ask questions in the moment rather than moving on to the next thing. We also had some github issues working on the wrong branches so that is something you could master for future projects. Overall, you were always patient and willing to take initiatives to get us to the next step and that made you a great partner to work with.”

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox used JavaScript and jQuery to provide functionality that appended and idea, allowed you to rank that idea, and remove it from the list. Users could search for ideas and it would filter them based on the search. It was also the first usage of local storage, which allowed users to refresh the page and it would maintain the ranks and remove deleted ideas.

Notes/What To Work On:

got a late start really digging into the project, but cranked through it in two days (!!!!!). Both seem really tired, but did a good job
really clean tidy HTML and CSS. nice!
lots of potatoes
one function handles up and down vote! hooray!

Functional Expectations

Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

HTML

Accessibility

Advanced Beginner	Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

Proficient	Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style

Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic

Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

Functions & Scope

Proficient	Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays

Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github

Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Exceptional	Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

PAIRING

Collaboration

Exceptional	Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

Working with Brandon came very easily at onset as we have been sitting next to one another since the beginning of the module. We had already established a friendly rapport, which made working together much easier. I can't say this project was a cake walk, but none of the difficulties had to do with Brandon. Over the holiday weekend, we didn't prioritize effectively and the project was pressed for time because of this. However, even though this happened, Brandon and I were able to commit to working on the project, both independently and together. Brandon was especially considerate in communicating with me and making sure he was taking on an equal share of the project. Additionally, he let me know when he had scheduled pairings should I want to join with him so we could work on the project together. I also appreciated Brandon's willingness to reach out for help when he was stuck. If something was confusing, he would ask me for help so we could go through it together. More often than not, this led to a more expedited solution and was able to help me reinforce my learning as well. It also made me feel comfortable about reaching out to him should I hit a roadblock. The only actionable coaching I can give to Brandon is to remember that we're learning a brand new skill/language and that there are always going to be growing pains. Brandon and I had a number of talks about keeping things in perspective and relishing little wins, which I think helped both of our morale. Making sure to keep these things in mind will not only help to get over the emotional hurdles of Turing, but will help clear your mind to focus on the task at hand. I think Brandon sometimes struggled with self-doubt (as we all do), which clouded his thought process when working on code. We are all capable of this, which is hard to remember some times, but if the self-doubt is unrelenting, take a step back to gather yourself. Overall, Brandon was a great partner to work with and was effective at delegating work load, making sure we were each doing our fair share. He was open and communicative about where he was in the project, his workload, and any extraneous circumstances that came up during our pairing. I would be ecstatic to work with Brandon again in the future. Brandon, we both have the capability to do this and it has only been four weeks! We've come so far in such a short time. Remind yourself of that often. I will too!

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In 2DoBox we were required to take another pair's code from IdeaBox and refactor it. It removed global variables, anonymous functions and nested if/else statements. It also required additional functionality that let you rank across a greater range, mark as read, sort ideas and persist on refresh.

Notes/What To Work On:

Missing functionality w/some extras: App shows more than the last 10 completed todos (part of phase 3) but YAY for character count functionality extension in Task input!

Good work w/following: Majority of refactoring - getting rid of anon functions, no deep-nested if/else statements, no global variables, and concise functions. CSS file neatly organized with very few areas that could be refactored. Discovering (and implementing) ternary operators. Doing a DTR and respecting each other's learning goals - sounded like the pairing went well!

Room for improvement w/following: Indentation/nesting/spacing in HTML. DRYing up code so that multiple functions/event listeners associated with showing cards based on importance work as a single, dynamic function (225-278). Same with edit title/edit body functions. Commenting between each event listener in JS file makes it harder to read.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

When faced with a large amount of work, growth mindset is something very helpful to be aware of. When you're frustrated or struggling, it helps to keep in mind that's part of the process. It's not about understanding something right away, but being willing to work toward that path and believing you can gain that knowledge.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

My biggest takeaway from this was thinking about what you could master. I like to get things right the first time, but that's not always an option. Instead, this reminded me to focus on one or two small things at a time, master them and continue building from there. It also made me think about how my emotional state can drain from my maximum capibility.

#### (Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This exercise was helpful to get outside of our cohorts and get to know some other people. This is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing with friends, so I think understanding the concept came pretty natually. Going forward I think I will consider it more up-front when working on group projects, establishing our working styles and doing a DTR.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This was a very interesting look at the gender dispartiy in the tech industry. While I can't say I have the same experiences as any others, I have worked in many jobs where the ratio is reversed for me as a male. I think this helps me keep that experience at the front of mind when working with others. I always try to look at people as individuals, and it's important to speak out when you hear something you don't agree with or the problem will continue.

#### (Case Study with Mod 4)

I attended the session Failing Gracefully. It was nice to make some connections with students you don't normally see. It was also reassuring to know many other people experience the same thoughts as you. Going forward I will try to think about how failure is perceived. Instead of looking at how you're viewed externally, think about how you can grow personally.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In Mod1 it's tricky to get your feet under you and still feel like you're making a significant contribution to the larger community. However, I tried to focus on the areas where I could contribute. I tried to keep in mind the duties of keeping the kitchen clean. Putting away dishes, emptying the full water trays and generally tidying up. I also tried to attend any other Turing events outside of the normal hours including guest speakers, happy hours, etc. Considering the amount of help I received, I always made sure to stick around and help others when they asked or jump in to offer assistance when possible.
