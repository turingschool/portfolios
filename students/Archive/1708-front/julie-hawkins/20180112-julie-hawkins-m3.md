## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### SWapi BOX

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A project using the Star Wars API which allows a user to view movie data in categories and to favorite characters, planets and vehicles from the movies. It is built using React.

##### Evaluator: Will
Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

Code Quality
* 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

CSS/Design
* 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Testing
* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

PropType Implementation
* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

Code Sanitation: The output from ESLint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

Workflow
* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


#### Personal Project - Stella Via
##### w/ Katie Scruggs

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiescruggs/stella-via)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

A self-directed project. Stella Via is a mobile app built with React Native and Redux, using GeoCoding, a Virtual-Sky map, NASA API and self-compiled data. It features the constellations you can see in the sky tonight.

##### Evaluator: Jhun
Completion
* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

CSS/Design
* 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Code Quality
* 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

Redux Architecture
* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers. Developer uses middleware. Actions and reducers are clean. At least one container is reused.

Code Sanitation: The output from ESLint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

Testing
* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested.

Workflow
* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions 
I thought this session was interesting and a great discussion about how our different perspectives and experiences affect our behaviors and feelings and how our words and behaviors affect others. There are so many factors that play into these things and it's nice to open up some conversation about the way society plays into our daily interactions with each other and how we can take a care to respect others and ourselves in safe and effective ways.

#### Attention Economy
This gear-up featured a video which helped to highlight how and why people spend time and attention on the internet. I found it very interesting to self-examine where my attention goes when I'm online. Thinking about this will be a very usefull asset to building successful apps.

#### Mod4 Choose-Your-Own-Adventure : BE YOUR OWN ALLY
I chose this gear up because I always feel I can work on my confidence and practice standing up for myself or others when the situation calls for it. I really enjoyed the video that the mod4 group chose about how it feels when you stand up for your self and you immediately feel unsure about doing so. I think they put together thoughtful scenarios for us to discuss and ultimately I left feeling more assured about how to 'be my own ally'.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
This mod I tried to be available to the mods below as much as possible, but was limited a bit due to a heavier project work load than last mod. I also tried to step up and organize some things for my posse as well as support the current student leader of our posse. I really enjoy being apart of my cohort's community and the Turing community as a whole and I try to be supportive of my class mates and help out where ever I can!
