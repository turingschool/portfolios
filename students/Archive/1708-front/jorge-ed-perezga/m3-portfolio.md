M3 PORTFOLIO
 
  ## Jorge Ed PerezGa - M3 Portfolio
  
  ## Areas of Emphasis
  
   My areas of emphasis this mod were to understand react and redux. 
   Also, to be present all lessons and continue to ask questions.

      ## Rubric

      Specification Adherence
      3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

      Code Quality
      4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

      CSS/Design
      4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

      Testing
      3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

      PropType Implementation
      Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

      Code Sanitation
      The output from ESLint shows…

      3 - Five or fewer complaints

      Workflow
      3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. 
      Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. 
      There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

      ## Rubric

      Feature Delivery
      1. Completion
      2 - Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

      CSS/Design
      2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

      Code Quality
      3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

      Redux Architecture
      2: Application state is mostly outside the control of Redux. Application did not make use of Redux actions and reducers to mutate state. Components do not demonstrate a clear understanding of stateful vs. statelessness.

      Code Sanitation
      The output from ESLint shows…

      4 - Zero complaints
      3 - Five or fewer complaints
      2 - Six to ten complaints
      1 - More than ten complaints

      Testing
      2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

      Workflow
      4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. 
      Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. 
      There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log. 
 
  ## C: Group Work & Projects

    #### HeadCount 2.0

     ### Evaluator: Will
     ### Students: Jorge & Jessie

      * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

      ## Rubric

      Specification Adherence
      3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

      Code Quality

      2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
      CSS/Design

      4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

      Testing
      2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

      PropType Implementation
      Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

      Code Sanitation
      The output from ESLint shows…
      4 - Zero complaints

      Workflow
      4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. 
      Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. 
      There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

      Surprise and Delight
      2 - Sparkles
      
      ## D: Professional Skills

  ### Gear Up
  
    #### Microaggression
    
    This session is so very important. Turing is a place where good people become excellent, kind people; a session like this gives students tools to change the world for the better, one person at the time.
 
    #### Attention Economy
    
    This session was one of my favorites. It was exciting to be exposed to the many resources a student can use after graduation to find a job or other members in the community that might share similar interests.
 
  ## E: Community Participation
  
    ### Playing a Part
 
    During mod3 I was very supportive to mod1 students, I met with them regularly to help and support. Additionally, on Fridays I led a thirty minute yoga class for the Turing community.
