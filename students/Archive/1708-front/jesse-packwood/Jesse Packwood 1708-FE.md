## Jesse Packwood Mod2 Portfolio
#### Areas of Emphasis

I had to embrace the gradual release of responsbility and tackle problems head on with my own knowledge. I also had to acknowledge when my mindset was becoming negative and also address it so I could change it. I put more responsibility on myself for my own learning but I also reached out and found a mentor. Since my mentor is outside of Turing I've been more mindful about how to ask for help by explaining how I've already attempted to solve the problem and my logic behind those attempts.

### E: Community Participation

Playing a Part

As a mod 2 student I paired with front end mod 1 students and helped them with their projects. I also started attending Iron FE and I led our cohort retro once this mod. As mod 3 has been wrapping up their personal projects I have been able to give them user feedback to them in order to return the favor of them helping me during mod 1 in pairings. I joined the Pahlka group and I'm excited to collaborate with a back end student to create a fully functioning app.

### Final Review
