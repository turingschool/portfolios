# Jesse Packwood - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to learn about responsive web design and walk away with a strong foundation in JavaScript. I struggled and learned a lot throughout this mod. I ultimately feel like I am in a good place with my understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and am ready to move on to Mod 2.

##### Evaluation Comments
- Team embraced the struggle, overcame speed-bumps and frustrations, and came out the other side with a good project.
- Good approaches for how they approached and worked through problems/struggles. Didn't just settle on first idea, pushed through to     really understand the problem and weren't afraid to get rid of code that wasn't helping them and start fresh.
- GOOD JOB!
- Code is ready for a refactor pass (which is a good place to be)

##### Evaluation Comments
- I can tell this pairing went very well - this was very apparent in how well you communicated with me and each other during the eval. HOORAY!
- Good specific naming with branches and commits
- Be sure to use shorthand in your CSS and comments to organize sections
- Check JS for redundancy

##### Evaluation Scores
###### Functional Expectations: 
- Exceptional	The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
###### HTML: 
* Accessibility: Advanced Beginner	Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Style: Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
###### CSS: 
* Structure of Code: Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
* Implementation: Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
###### JS: 
* Data Types: Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
* Conditional Logic: Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
* Functions & Scope: Proficient	Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
* Arrays: Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
* Objects & Prototypes: Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
* DOM Manipulation: Proficient
* Style: Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
###### GIT & GITHUB:
* Git: Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* GitHub: Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
###### DESIGN:
* Comp-Recreation: Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
###### PAIRING: 
* Exceptional	Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

##### Evaluation Comments
- Functionality - All 3 phases completed - HOORAY!!
- Good work w/following: Nice work having no deep-nested if/else statements, removing anon functions that aren't necessary, and no global variables. YAY for ARIA!! Nice color button and UX touches (cursor changes and coloring for buttons). Love that you're using Waffle/issues for project management! Good naming for feature branches and commits.
- Be sure to use shorthand in your CSS and comments to organize sections
- Room for improvement w/following: Set properties of id, importance, and completed should be defaults in constructor. You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage or appending cards like in lines 63, 112, and 200 as any one unique card object should only be instantiated once. Lines 265-308 could be refactored into one single, dynamic function. Upvote/downvote could also be refactored into one dynamic function.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to get involved with the community as much as I could while still balancing my time for projects and personal life. I attended demo night and happy hour on Thursdays so I could bond with my classmates as well as other people in my community in different parts of the program. My partner and I submitted our IdeaBox project into the codefair and I was always eager to help my classmates on their projects when asked. I'm grateful for all the help and support the upper-mod students have given me and I hope that I will be as influential on future students as I continue at Turing.
