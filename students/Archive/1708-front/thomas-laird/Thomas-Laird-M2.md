# Thomas Laird - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to build comfort in javascript and develop my ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently especially as the complexity of problems increased.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module's solo projects were Sorting Suite and CompleteMe.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/SortingSuite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting suite gave us some insight into how data can be effectively sorted as well as the strengths and limitations of various sorting algorithms. It also introduced core CS and computing concepts like performance and big O. 

##### Evaluator:  Leta

##### Score:
Pass

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/t6r6l5/Weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)
The complete me project introduced a variety of different data structures such as binary tree, linked list and a trie. With the latter data structure in mind, we built a trie and populated it with dictionary words in order to build an ‘autocomplete’ field which suggested words based upon the query and would intelligently prioritize suggestions based upon the recency and frequency of a selection.

##### Evaluator: Nathaniel

##### Evaluator Comments: 

###### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

###### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

###### Code Sanitation
* 4: The output from ESLint shows zero complaints

-----------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

This module's paired projects were Game Time and Weathrly

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/t6r6l5/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game Time introduced HTML canvas and also a number of ES6 concepts especially the use and interaction of different classes. We also explored TDD and writing effective tests which ensure that functionality is preserved throughout iterations of the program.

##### Evaluator: Nathaniel
##### Evaluator Comments: 
##### Scores
* Functional Expectations - 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* User Interface - 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
 * Testing - 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

 * JavaScript Style - 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

 * Workflow – 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
 * Code Sanitation - 4 The output from JSHint shows zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL]( https://github.com/t6r6l5/Weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly introduced react as a framework in addition to the use of APIs. This project also provided an opportunity to work with enzyme and jest as a means of testing react.

##### Evaluator: Leta

##### Scores

* Specification Adherence - 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

* User Interface - 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

* HTML Style – 4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


* CSS/Sass Style 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


* JavaScript / React Style - 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.


* Testing - 3.75 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.


* Workflow - 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


* Code Sanitation - 4 - Zero complaints. The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

## D: Professional Skills
This module gave us the opportunity to further develop our ability to work in teams in addition to contributing to the broader turing community. Some of my reflections from this mod can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1708-f/thomas_laird.md).

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My primary goal throughout this mod in terms of contributing to the community was to pair as often as I was available. In the typical week, I offered both afternoon and lunch pairings on all 5 days of the week and typically had 8+ pairings in the average week. I also tried to take on a leadership role within my posse. Finally, I was available as often as possible to members of my cohort and tried to explain and teach as frequently as possible.
