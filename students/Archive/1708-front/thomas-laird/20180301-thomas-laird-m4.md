# Thomas Laird - M4 Portfolio

## [30 Day Action Plan Gist](https://gist.github.com/t-laird/3d42c745a9a0098766e0475c6929bfc5)

### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
#### Success at Turing
* Saying “I wonder if I can …” then trying it and finding out for sure
  * Mapping over array to create endpoints
* Never finding the right GitHub issue or StackOverflow question to fix a problem and then figuring it out myself instead of scrapping the idea and taking a different direction.
  * Understanding what Rafrex is doing and then adapting a solution to a niche problem.
* Always taking something away when seeing an unfamiliar code base.
  * Learning something from House of Vars and the codebases of classmates on projects.


#### Struggles in Mod 4
* Lack of Depth
  * Turing Rhythm - Gradually dive deeper and deeper into a concept.
  * Mod 4 Rhythm (after week 1) - 4 or 5 days a week of getting introduced to a concept, doing some simple implementation of that concept, moving on immediately to something different.

* Structural Differences
  * Lack of Feedback
    * More Personal Ownership
  * Less Instructional Time
    * Self directed time
  * Shorter Timelines / Unspecific Deliverables
    * Develop Own Goals
    * Work based upon interest instead of pure necessity

* Balancing Act
  * Prioritizing Job Hunting vs. Mod 4
    * Not meeting my own standards on either early on.
    * Making adjustments and reorienting priorities.


#### Standing Out
* Going Beyond the Requirements
  * Taking short introductory lessons like Service Workers, Socket.io, etc. and trying to implement them on my own to old projects.
* Enjoying the Challenge
  * Undeterred by how difficult or unfamiliar something is.
* Reading Docs, Articles and Taking away Relevant Information
  * Happy to read the docs, blog posts, Medium articles, etc. on anything I’m working with. 
    * Comfortable with applying principles learned quickly.

#### Experiencing Backend
* Building a Backend
  * Feeling empowered to build anything
  * Appreciating the challenge in this area.
  Understanding how to better prepare data to be used * on the Frontend.
  * Learning how challenging this can be.
  * No longer feeling confined to front end!

#### Moving Forward
* Confidence in my ability to learn.
  * Excited to branch out.
  * Empathy towards users, fellow devs.
