## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Reflections:

* [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)
The Microaggressions gear up introduced the variety of ways in which microaggressions happen on a daily basis. By clarifying the types of situations in which microaggressions often occur we can confront and resolve these microaggressions. This will help create an environment in which people of all walks of life feel comfortable and respected.


* [Attention Economy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)
The attention economy gear up reiterated the idea that tech is not always created altruistically. Becoming cognizant of the ways in which tech will try to absorb as much of its user's time as possible (interaction = time on app = money) is critical in being able to disrupt some of the patterns which develop in our daily interactions with tech. Furthermore, it solidifies the importance of developing products in a way that you know will help people.

* [Jobs from Blogs](https://gist.github.com/dphilla/fec4f18955ac6faad5407a9996d95a22)
Jobs from Blogs helped me procure strategies for developing blogs in the future. Additionally, it explored the idea that writing a blog on a specific can lead both to an increased personal understanding of the topic, but also to a better ability to articulate the intricacies of a topic. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
This mod I took over leadership of my posse. I organized the time spent on Fridays, including getting several of our posse's mentors in for a Q&A that was widely attended by a large number of Turing students.
