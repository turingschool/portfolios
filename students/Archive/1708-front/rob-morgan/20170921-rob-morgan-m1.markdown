# Rob Morgan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

When I arrived, I had some experience with HTML and CSS but no experience with JS, jQuery, Github, or pair programming.  So I prioritized making the unfamiliar things into strengths, most notably, JS and jQuery, knowing that these build much of the foundation going forward.  Significant progress was made.

### Static Comps

The static comps were designed to make us recreate a webpage using HTML and CSS and then make them completely functional on all screensizes.  The first two were fairly simple but the last one was much more complex.

#### Static Comp 1

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Mod 1 projects began with very simple single page applications that can't save, and moved to projects that required saving larger amounts of data locally and manipulating the DOM to display a variety of things.  They got significantly more complex.

#### LinkedList

* https://github.com/rennmatthewp/linked-list-mrrm (Github - LinkedList)
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html (Original Project - LinkedList)

LinkedList is a simple application to save bookmark URLs, give them titles and descriptions, mark them as read or unread, and delete them from the list.

##### Partner feedback from Matt Renn

I enjoyed working with you Rob. Your pursuit of excellent UX pushed our project well past the standard functionality of the project spec. I especially enjoyed working with you on the features that we were allowed some freedom to design(the animations and the counters and the clear buttons). When I got into the weeds, you allowed me the space I need to think through problems and find my way out, and when we couldn’t figure it out, you weren’t opposed to reaching out for help. That’s what I need in an partner. To improve workflow, practice your hot-key shortcuts to reduce time spent using the mouse. I’m looking forward to working with you again.


#### IdeaBox 

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/ideabox-r-j (Github - IdeaBox)
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html (Original Project - IdeaBox)

IdeaBox is an application that allows a user to create and save into local storage ideas by title and description.

##### Partner feedback from Julie Hawkins
I really enjoyed working with you on building ideabox. Sharing ideas about design sensibility and user experience was really fun and I enjoyed learning your perspectives on those subjects. I really appreciate your dedication to the project and to persevere through the times when we would feel stuck. I think you have a great sensibility about how to dissect problems in order to find a solution and you taught me about how to walk through each step carefully to find the issues and address them one by one. One thing I think we could both improve on is taking small breaks after periods of intense brainwork. I think both of us get "in-the-zone" very easily and while it is great to use that momentum to push through and get a lot done, I also believe it could help to step away here and there to help prevent brain-fatigue. I am really proud of our project and how clean and organized the code turned out. Thanks, Julie.

#### 2DoBox
* https://github.com/PreciseSlice/2DoBox-Pivot (Github - 2DoBox)
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html (Original Project - 2DoBox)

In 2DoBox, we were given someone elses code from IdeaBox and refactored the code to clean it up and then pivoted it into a whole new project.

##### Students: Rob and Spencer
##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

- Functionality - Made it through all 3 phases!

- Good work w/following:
    Stylistic changes for 2doBox. Clear that you kept UX in mind with the buttons, color choices, and positioning of elements for mobile. Nice work with avoiding deep-nested if/else statements and global variables. Yay for ARIA!!! I love that you are using comments in your PRs and that your naming is specific on your commit/PR history. Sounds like pairing went well!

- Room for improvement w/following:
    DRYing/refactoring functions in JS. Refactoring upvote/downvote into one single, dynamic function. Same for edit card/edit task. You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage or filtering for search like in lines 225 and 232 as any one unique card object should only be instantiated once. Redundant code on lines 177-179, 186-188, 195-197, and 205-207 that could be refactored.

## D: Professional Skills

Professional Skills sessions were intended to get us thinking like a professional developer, from eagerly tackling difficult challenges, to preemptively addressing potential difficulties in the worklplace.

### Gear Up

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/gearup-reflections-mod1 (Github - Gearup Reflections)

#### Growth Mindset

I liked this session.  It helped me to not fear the things that I don't know.  I still struggle with the idea that I can't know everything I'll need to know, but a growth mindset means you don't have to worry about that.  Instead, it makes the daily challenge of learning enjoyable.

One other tidbit: the Turing program wasn't designed such that a student would make perfect scores on every project.  While that is very different from any other schooling I've been involved with in the past, I see this as a good thing that will keep me focused on growth more than grades.

I have an added response as I went back through my notes today, at the end of Mod 1.  I noted on the day we talked about growth mindset that, reading through the number guesser project had put me at least in part into a fixed mindset.  There were a bunch of things I didn't understand how to do when I first read through the project requirements.  Now, only 4 weeks later, I bet I could rewrite that entire project in an hour or two, and it would be better.  So there has been significant progress which is nice to see.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

I enjoyed this session.  I've learned most things in my life by figuring them out on my own, with the help of resources like youtube or lynda.com, or before those existed, books.  I can see now that there is a better way.  Learning from a master, being willing to ask lots of questions, even if it means giving up some of my percieved independence, will help me learn faster and better.

As I look back through my notes from that session, here at the end of Mod 1, I'll add one more thing.  A big part of the model at Turing is to take what you've learned and teach it to others, through formal pairing, or simply by looking for someone with "that look" in their eyes who needs help.  In the last few weeks, I've focused a lot on helping others figure out the stuff that I've got down.  That hasn't helped only them.  I've solidified many topics by helping others understand them.  So both sides of a pairing got a lot out their time--which is pretty cool.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts

I wasn't surprised by a lot here but picked up a few things.  I'm pretty heavily introverted and as a result have a difficult time understanding why extroverts are the way they are.  As well, it doesn't seem like extroverts fully understand introverts.  What we talked about today was that it isn't as important to understand why someone doesn't think similarly, but it is important to give someone the space and freedom to be the best version of themselves they can be.  A more extroverted person may need to talk through a problem where a more introverted person may choose to think through that problem instead.  Neither approach is wrong.  Also, no one is 100% introverted or extroverted.  We're all somewhere in between and I'd even bet that can change a little bit from day to day depending on how we're feeling.  So, when dealing with others, it's important to treat others right, no matter where they are at on any given day.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

I think this film is designed to bring about strong emotions, and indeed it does.  From my experience, the job of being a developer has been talked down and "nerdified" in main stream culture to the point where people who desire to be cool would never consider it.  I think this misconception has had a lot to do with why a lot people have sadly avoided an interesting and profitable industry.

I wondered when I heard the terrible stories about women in the industry being treated so poorly if this was a rampant problem or if these were isolated circumstances.  I would have liked a lot more context to better understand what happened--like the point of view of others near the situation.  Or to hear from women who are doing great as developers and are valued in their workplaces.  Also, if I'm not wrong, all of the events in the film took place in and around San Francisco.  So I wonder what the situation is like in Denver and other places.  I agree that diversity is greatly desirable in the industry, but I'm not sure this film is going to convince women to become developers.

And finally, I dislike the terms tolerance and inclusion.  It isn't because they aren't good--they are fine.  It's because tolerance and inclusion don't go nearly far enough.  There is a lot of hate in this world, that can not be defeated by things so minimal.  Instead, I'd recommend choosing to love people first.  If you choose to love them as people and as fellow travelers through this world, then you'll see them as brothers and sisters, not just random people in random places.  Tolerance and inclusion are the very least that you can do for someone--only a short step above hate.  Love goes a lot further, is more challenging, but is powerful enough to deal with the hate that exists in this world.  I've got a whole lot more to say about this, but this isn't the forum.

#### Case Study with Mod 4

I took two things away from our discussion.  First, is the bad part.  The amount of information that exists in the wild about each of us is a bit scary.  Nearly all of us in the class wished this wasn't the case, though there weren't any solutions brought forward.  It would take a political movement/new laws to attempt to limit the amount of information that can be gathered about each of us.  In the meantime, we should all be careful what we do and where we go online.

But secondly, from a business standpoint, there is almost limitless opportunity to better understand your target market.  When this information is used wisely and appropriately, it can really benefit a business.  I don't believe you have to invade people's privacy to gain valuable insights into customer behavior that can be used to better serve them--and as a result, improve your bottom line.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I came early and stayed late (I think) every night while I was in Mod 1.  That enabled me to get to know people outside of classtime as well as help people through the subjects where I was strong.  I became a go-to person for CSS within our Mod and also for Mythical Creatures and some JS DOM manipulation problems too.  Through pairing, I got to know a number of the Mod 2 students, and through posses I got to know three of the Mod 4 students.  All were very helpful and helped me to understand the value of teaching material to someone else--examples I took to heart and action immediately.  As a result of teaching/helping others, I grew stronger in several areas, and I believe it helped others to get through Mod 1 as well.
