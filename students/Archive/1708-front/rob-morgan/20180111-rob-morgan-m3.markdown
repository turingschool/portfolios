# Rob Morgan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

When I got finished with Mod 2 I was uncomfortable (at best) with React and couldn't really write any tests for it without significant help.  At the end of Mod 3, I'm very comfortable with React, Redux, testing, making various API calls and a bunch of other new things.  I'm pleased with my progress.

----------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass.  I was actually disappointed in the way this went.  I rolled through the morning and got the majority of the project done by lunch.  Then I got stuck on 2 things after lunch and, though I eventually figured those problems out, I lost too much time to finish the project.  However, the code was clean, what I wrote was thoroughly tested, and it worked.

## A2: Mid Mod Assessment

Pass.  I had to put this in here.  This was my only eval with Jhun.  There was some error that could not be found or fixed as soon as I started writing code.  I ended up doing the eval on Christie's computer.  So either my computer choked under the pressure, or possibly Jhun is bad luck?

## B: Projects - Individual

There was just one individual project in Mod 3: swapiBox

*********

### swapiBox

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/swapi-box (swapiBox - Github repo)

This project was an enigma.  The mod ahead of us kept telling us how hard it was (I suppose because it was a pair project on a short timeframe).  Weirdly, I had an easier time with this project than probably any I've done at Turing.  I thought the new way of making fetches using Async/Await was intuitive and simple, and the whole project went smoothly.

## C: Projects - Group

There were three group projects in Mod 3

*********

### Headcount

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/headcount (Headcount - Github repo)

This was a pair project intended to show how React can be used to quickly and fairly easily display and compare large datasets.  We compared data from elementary school systems in Colorado, displaying data in different ways depending on how it compared.  The workflow with Jason went smoothly.  We spent a lot of time on testing and improved a lot at building React components.  

As a side note, I got a lot out of both evals I had with Will.  He's a wizard at React testing and I'm thankful for his help with it.  Tests in later projects were better because of his advice.

### Movie Tracker

* https://github.com/rmorgan323/movie-tracker (Movie Tracker - Github repo)

This was a 3-person group project using Redux (for the first time), adding Thunk middleware, displaying and favoriting a list of movies pulled from an API.  In the end, this was the most difficult project I have worked on while at Turing.  I struggled with it from start to finish, as did my partners.  But I'm proud to report that with some late nights, mild swearing, and group encouragement, we crushed the result.  The finished product was really solid.

### Snap Ninja - Personal Project

* https://github.com/t-laird/snap-ninja (Snap Ninja - Frontend - Github repo)
* https://github.com/t-laird/rt-personalproject-be (Snap Ninja - Backend - Github repo)
* https://www.t-laird.com/snap-ninja (Live - finished product)

I had worked with Thomas once before and I was excited to work with him again, mainly because I know what a hard worker he is.  I knew we'd come up with something cool.  So we decided to create Snap Ninja, which is an app targeted towards students that allows them to give points, comments, and more to teammates for helping them out.  It's intended to encourage mentorship and collaboration between students.  We were very ambitious in what we attempted to do.  We created a backend in Express/Node.js/PostgreSQL/Knex, auth with Github credentials using AuthRocket, and then a frontend in React/Redux/Router, adding in a slack integration, charts in Victory, and more.  We had an extra week to work on it because of Christmas break.

We are very proud of the result.  Functionally it's excellent, we have full authentication on all requests, we think we have covered most or all of the multitude of edge cases, the product is thoroughly tested on the frontend and backend, it looks great, and it's deployed and available for use.  Several classmates are already using it.

## D: Professional Development & Gearup

### Professional Storytelling & Resumes

This was a very useful session, going through the basics of a resume and getting advice on how to put a good one together.  I took good notes and used them to help me produce my own resume.  

### Flower Exercise

The flower exercise was pretty useful.  It got me thinking about a couple of important priorities when thinking about work.  In the past, I've sort of taken whatever job I could get.  Sadly, I've never had the opportunity to be choosy about a work environment.  So I think the flower exercise was helpful for focusing job search priorities.

### Finding Opportunities

This one had the potential to be pretty good but ended up feeling pretty disorganized.  We mainly just sat around and searched for jobs on our computers for an hour and then left.  A simple list in a Slack channel with good places to look for jobs would have been as effective I think.  I tried to make the most of it by taking a few notes and talking about job searches with the people around me.

### Resume Review Workshop

This was the best one of all.  I, and a small group, met with Louisa, who had good feedback and advice for finishing to put together a quality resume.  I really appreciate her input.  The resume I have now reflects many of the things we talked about and I'm pleased with how it looks and I believe it's clear and scanable.  It was helpful to see others' work too.  TURING!  We'd like more PD sessions like this.

### Community Gear Up

It was an interesting discussion that I was suprised to hear people's opinions on.  We talked about Apple declining to break into someone's phone at the request of the FBI.  Most people believed Apple had done the right thing.  The discussion was civil and interesting...and there were animal noises.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As has been the case from the beginning, I'm at Turing late almost every night.  This has allowed me to get to know lots of people and get a lot of studying done.  I've enjoyed hanging out with the late-night crowd.  We're a bunch of pale-faced, messy-haired, go-getters.

As well, I've enjoyed the 1708FE cohort.  We're known as the "mellow" cohort, which suits me perfectly.  I've never had any troubles working with anyone and have seen the value that each individual has to offer in a project.
