# Biggest Achievement of the Module?

Learning how the backend works and having a full understanding of how applications work as a whole. 
Even if I don't end up working on the backend in my first job, I can now at least speak to it 
and have a better understanding of the web as a whole. 


# What provided me with the most struggle during the module? 

Learning the backend environment and using JQuery for the first time in a while. Palette Picker was a bit of a 
learning curve and didn’t go as smoothly as I would have liked. 
### What did I learn from the struggle?
After struggling through Palette Picker, I learned how to think about the backed in stages, taking one thing at a 
time. If something is not working, there is probably a 
small error as to why, so take your time and think about what you’re doing, will most likely 
save you time in the long run. 


# What have I done during this module that sets me apart from my peers?

I think what sets me apart from my peers is my ability to handle stress well. I was definitely burnt out this 
mod, and not always optimistic, but I am always able to look at the bigger picture and focus on one thing at
a time when need be. That being said, my peers were all awesome and extremely hard working.   


# How did learning the backend impact what I want to do after Turing?

I don't think it changed what I want to do, but gives me better knowledge of my craft, which is priceless. I still prefer
working in the front end as I’m a visual person, but knowing how to set up my own back end is exciting. 
How did it reframe what I learned in previous Modules?
Working with jQuery again made me miss using React and Redux. 
I like working in the the front end more than I do the backend. 

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

The most important thing that I have learned is that I’m capable of learning complex things 
in a short amount of time. Also, even though something looks crazy and complicated at first, once 
you break it down into little bite-sized pieces, it's really not that scary at all. There are so 
many resources online that are a quick google search away, so I’m excited to keep on learning.
