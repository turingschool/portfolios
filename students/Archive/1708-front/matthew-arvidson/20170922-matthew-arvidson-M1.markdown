# (Matthew-Arvidson) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
	I am repeating M1 so I set to accomplish a successful graduation, and moving on to M2. At the end of my first round of M1.1 I self-diagnosed thatI was not where I needed to be in order to complete Pentathlon. After that I had to come to terms with my new reality, focus on the silver linings, and move forward. I believe this played a role in sharpening my focus and narrowed the scope of what I allowed to fill my time. Hours became a precious commodity. 
	I set up a meeting with Ellen Mary and we went over what I was doing during M1.1 and drew up battle plans for how to defeat M1.2. Over the intermission I immediately went back on rewriting my notes for all of the lessons using multi colored pens and graph paper. I found that this made my life so much easier throughout M1.2. To get on track to learn everything by the end I used time-boxing, established 30 min struggle caps, and reached out friends/mentors/slack community for resources for when I needed help. My plan was to stay at Turing until my work was done because I realized that my work efficiency at home dropped compared to when I stayed at Turing. Thusly I arrived at 8am and left around 7-8pm everyday, and that helped me get what I needed done and help me separate my life from Turing so I could have luxurious things like… dinner with my wife, and a reasonable bedtime.
	The culmination of all of these factors, along with the excellent instructing from my instructors, I finally understand how to code shopping/wish list, and how to read/test/write/+retest mythical creatures, to the point where I could find edge cases that could slip through the testing and was able to write a better test and make it pass. The feeling of understanding has been euphoria for me as retaking M1 was serious decision for me. I felt so defeated after not passing the first time I had ask myself if this was the right thing for me. After a lot of soul searching I decided that it was for me and that I was going to pass M1.2, and nothing would stop me. 
	So here we are, and I believe that my portfolio will only further demonstrate the effort that I have put into this and the quality of my work will show that I have solid understanding of what we have learned and I am ready to move forward and into M2.
Thank you for your time and for meeting with me to hear my Deensing. 


## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

  I believe that because I have completed the requirements asked of me and demonstrated my abilities on each project both individual and group. I do not believe that I have earned a 4 in this category, because I certainly have room for improvements. I believe that I have earned a solid 3 in this category because I give myself the title “Most improved player” based on where I started to where I am now. I have a strong growth mindset and know that I am going to do great things after I graduate. Supporting my family will just be the start.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

  I gave myself a 3 for this category based on reading the details of each grade from the rubric. I completed all tasks given to me, demonstrated what I learned via my projects, and can apply what I’ve learned in my evals. I have room for improvement here as well, certainly regarding my anxiety and stress levels during evals, but I am getting it under control and I am learning to adapt and move forward regardless of my occasionally crazy brain.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

	I gave myself a 4 for this category because I believe that my deep involvement with being a Student Ambassador and leader of the Kay Posse shows that I am willing to go above and beyond the average scope of the Turing student and in doing so I am able to make more connections reaching out to every mentor to get them to come in for a Q+A will only lead to my professional skills improving, and my list of contacts and resources will grow and it will ensure getting job after I graduate.

### Gear Up

#### (Growth mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/MatthewArvidson/02c218e721ff03a84520e11f430fd945)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

  The growth mindset gear up was two totally different experiences, from M1.1 to M1.2, for me. Originally I thought I had a growth mindset coming into Turing or I wouldn’t be here, but after going through a second time I truly have a growth mindset. This session exposed some areas of my life that I had fixed mindsets about and that has allowed me to target them and fully embrace growth. Now I no longer think or say that I can’t do something, now I say I haven’t learned that YET!

#### (Getting better at difficult things)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/MatthewArvidson/02c218e721ff03a84520e11f430fd945)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

	This session helped me recognize that I need to see the progress through the struggle and to embrace difficult tasks. I really like the analogy from the article, “I felt, as I always feel, like I was stumbling around in the dark. I still feel like that. But I also feel like I am getting better at stumbling.”. That really describes what it is like to learn to code. Seeing failures as simply the path to success is a paradigm shit in thinking and one that I am happy to be able to identify within me and adopt myself.

#### (Dealing with the Difference; Introverts and Extroverts)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/MatthewArvidson/02c218e721ff03a84520e11f430fd945)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

	Before this session I had the common belief that I introverts were nerdy, shy, and always stayed at home while extroverts are the ones who live by going from party to party. Afterwards I understood that it is based on how interaction with other people makes you feel. For me I am drained after dealing with people all day and feel relaxed and being to recharge when I get home where I can be alone. Extroverts get tired when they can’t interact and get their recharge from going out with friends. This session was very interesting and has caused me to reevaluate my entire conception of introverts and extroverts.

#### (Code: Debugging the gender gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/MatthewArvidson/02c218e721ff03a84520e11f430fd945)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

	This session was a real eye opener for me as my pre conceived notions of how I thought the industry operated and how the numbers told a much different story. I believe that part of the core of the issue is how social norms and the media distort the value of women and in coding. The coding community will only benefit from having more diverse workforce. We need to be the change we want to see and because of that I will do my part to spread awareness so it can bring change.

#### (M4 Case study: Failing gracefully)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/MatthewArvidson/02c218e721ff03a84520e11f430fd945)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

	This session was also an excellent experience for me as this is something I need to work on personally. Ultimately my take away was summed up in an analogy I came up and shared with the group. I find solace in statistics at times and that is true for failure. If you have a drawer of some different colors of socks, and you are trying to blindly grab a red sock. If you try once the probability of getting a red sock low. If you reach in 10 times your probability of grabbing red sock increases, and so on to point of infinity. If set the number of instances of reaching into the drawer to infinite, then the probability switches to an inevitability. The only way to set you probability of success to zero is to stop trying. You will never grab a red sock if stop reaching into the drawer.

## E: Community Participation

	I am one of the two Student Ambassadors for the cohort and I am the leader the Kay Posse. I believe that demonstrates how committed I am to furthering the Turing community and bringing our cohort together so we can succeed together. I also offer help to anyone who asks and I am always happy to go over code with people because it helps them and only reinforces what I’ve learned and exposes me to different ways of approaching code problems. I am excited to move forward through Turing because I feel that my leadership roles give me a more rewarding experience.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I have attended a Meet up outside of Turing. I also went to the Code Wars challenge and watched the groups show off their projects in front of judges. It was great chance to chat up some industry folks.
