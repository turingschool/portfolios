# B: Projects

## Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/restaurant-randomizer)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Checkins and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1708/mod-3/personal-projects/SamSinger/rubric.md)

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor. necessary.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints
### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cache123/movie-tracker-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Checkins and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1708/mod-3/movie-tracker/thomas-sam-djr.md)

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)


### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Swapi Box

* [Checkins and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/edit/master/1708/mod-3/swapi/sam-singer/scores.md)

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

2+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## HeadCount

* [Checkins and Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/edit/master/1708/mod-3/headcount/samsinger/template.md)

### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design


<!-- - 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/) -->
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

<!-- - 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing -->
- 1 - There was little to no attempt to test this application.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

- 2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.

# C: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

A reflection on micro-agressions, this Gear-Up provided a good opportunity to reflect on the everyday interactions I find myself in and how I can be more aware of others' identities. The conscientious approach and ability to go forward in a positive manner wanting to make an impact for the better is something that we should all consider implementing.

### Mod 4 Lead - Growth Mindset

This gear up was lead by a handful of the MOD 4 students and shared their beliefs and ideas with a persisting growth mindset and how important as programs that this mindset should persist throughout our careers.

# D: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

I was definitely more active in the previous MODs with my active participation in the community and will strive to increase my effor in the following MOD and continuing forward as well.
