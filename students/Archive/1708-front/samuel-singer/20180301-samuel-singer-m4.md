# Biggest Achievement of the Module?

Gaining insight and appreciation for the backend. I'm now able to competently set up my own simplified server incorporating HTTPS redirect, JWTokens, and authentication for performing specific request methods 

# What provided me with the most struggle during the module? 

My biggest struggle was not technical this mod. It was the fact that I isolated myself from my peers and any help that I could have received if I hadn't done so. Why did I do it? I felt lost and a strong sense of imposter syndrome at least with this cohort. Great cohort and strong developers in the making. Fear I was stepping on peoples toes by asking questions that they potentially had alrady solved days ago.


## What did I learn from the struggle?

I learned so much from this experience! First off I will never do that again! Creating fear and islation just harbors and grows an increased desire for that route. Although it did have its upsides. I learned so much in the sense of having to be more self-sufficient and taking the time to really work through problems where in the past I may have given up and turned to a peer for a quick solution. 

# What have I done during this module that sets me apart from my peers?

What sets me apart from my cohort is interesting and surprising especially given my isolation toward my peers. I have contacted many different developers across the nation and in areas where I feel there is a high probability that I may achieve success.  

# How did learning the backend impact what I want to do after Turing?

It didn't :) Although the backend is fascinating and more logical than the frontend, I am still heavily interested in pursuing a career trajectory with the frontend. I want to create user experiences and user interfaces that people can enjoy and manipulate. I wouldn't mind having a job that would entail both but I would prefer having a majority of time spent with the frontend.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

My growing growth mindset! Although I do not have a fully consistent growth mindset quite yet, I am developing it. This will allow me to flexibly and fluidly approach real world problems with a healthy and determined mindset.
