## Jason Hughes - M3 Portfolio
 
 ## Areas of Emphasis
  My goals this mod were to get more confident with Javascript fundamentals, React, and get comfortable with Redux. I feel as though all of things

#### HeadCount 2.0

### Evaluator: Will
### Students: Jason Rob
 
 * [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/jasonhughes1/HeadCount)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
 
## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow
- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Surprise and Delight
- 2 - Sparkles

 # Personal Project Eval

### Evaluator: Jhun
### Students: Jason 
### Comments:


### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)


### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Workflow

 ## D: Professional Skills
 ### Gear Up
 #### Microagressions
 *My takeaways from the Microaggression gear-up are around being advocates for others and calling out microagressions when I see them. Everyone is different and have had different experiences in the past. It's important to keep in mind that something your say 100 times to your friends, may have a serious impact on a certain individual. It's important to be mindful of what you say and how you say it. 
 

#### Attention Economy
This session was interesting because it is undoubtably going to play a major part in all of our jobs at one point or another. The amount of information right in front of my face is something that I think about everyday. There is an unlimited amount of data and information to parse through that there will never be enough time. Now, as a software developer, I will have a role in how other people view information, and how, psychologically, they think about when to leave a website or application. 
 

#### Jobs from blogs
This session was led by mod4 students. It was an eye opener into the world of blogging, and that is is probably always something that you can contribute. 
Even if you feel as though your knowledge on a subject is limited, you still probably know more than someone is is just getting started, so why not write a 
Blog about it?!

 ## E: Community Participation
 
 ### Playing a Part

Attend and contribute to IronFE. Help mod1 and mod2. Help with questions other members of my mod would have (that I may know the answer to)
