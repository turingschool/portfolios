# Hugh Hartigan Mod 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I made an effort to connect with my peers more and be more vocal about group sessions and reviewing code. I also wanted to focus on my ability to explain code and understand conditional logic at a higher level. This was fostered by my willingness to pair with the mod below us and attend IronFE sessions with the two mods above us. JavaScript logic was something I struggled with before heading to Turing and I feel as though I have a solid, fundamental understanding of the ins-and-outs of basic JS, which has allowed me to more quickly adopt subset languages, such as React.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I made a greater effort to lead group sessions with my mod and make myself more available for code review, which helped me to establish a closer connection with my peers. I also attended several IronFE sessions in order to connect with the mod above us. The greatest stride I made was in pairing with the mod below us. I made myself available for lunch almost every single day and left the morning as unscheduled time in case someone wanted felt a need to meet up outside of my availability. Patrick and I also showed our project during Code Fair and were able to talk to other mods and cohorts about our process.
