## Code challenges are tough

I noticed code challenges were difficult for me during Mod-3 and made an effort to practice them, but didn’t follow through. Because of this, the code challenges during Mod-4 were intimidating and I was reluctant to sign-up for mock interviews, which was a mistake.

### Positive Spin

At very least I *know* this is an area I need to focus on and can do so moving forward. Plus, I’m not totally out of practice, having lead an Iron-FE situation every week.

## The tech world doesn’t know me (...yet)

During Mod 4 I signed up for several meetups and didn’t attend a single one. With how comfortable I am with meeting strangers and networking, this was a lost opportunity to meet potential employers on a more personal level.

### Positive Spin

Turing is over and I have my life back! Now I have no excuse not to go to meetups and start mingling with the tech world. Plus, even though I may not have gone to any meetups, I had 5+ coffee dates with developers during Mod 4.

## I still don’t *really* know where I want to work

During the job search I relied almost exclusively on Built In Colorado, which was extremely limiting when trying to find a right fit. Though I have a good idea of a few places I like and don’t like, this limited my scope.

### Positive Spin

I may not have focused on the actual search, but I’m very happy with my resume, portfolio, and the cover letters that I have written thus far. I have the tools I need, now I just need to hit the ground running.

## It's surreal, but I'm done

Every step of the way, I knew I would make it, but, the fact that I’m actually sitting here with the final evaluation panel about to graduate is mind boggling. This is an enormous accomplishment in and of itself and I can't believe it's finally come to an end. Almost exactly a year ago I attended a Try Coding event, had my interview, and made a decision to attend in August. Once August rolled around, I quit my job even though I had an opportunity at a nearly 75% pay raise because I knew I was unhappy and needed a change. I drank the Kool-aid and am happy I gave myself this opportunity.
    
## But seriously, I crush Palette Picker PWA

Palette Picker was tough and pivoting it into a PWA wasn’t easy, but I went above and beyond, making custom images and building a ‘mad scientist’ theme with kids in mind. I stuck to a design inspiration and worked over time to get it done. It may not be my ‘best’ project, but it was one of the most fun.

Even though I have a design background, I haven't been able to put it to much use with the workload of Turing. When 'finding a design inspiration' was a requirement for Palette Picker, I landed on the idea of a child's doodles, pretending to be a mad scientist. This idea didn't come full circle on the initial submission of Palette Picker, so I spent the entire weekend designing custom graphics and buttons. Once the PWA was turned in, I was incredibly happy with the end result.

## I accidentally became the face of Iron-FE (and loved it)

I’ll be honest. At the end of Mod-2 when I wasn’t picked to be a SAB representative, I was pissed. Three people were nominated, our peers voted, and I was the one that lost out. BUT! I took this as an opportunity to lead somewhere else and reached out to 1706 to see how I could help lead Iron-FE. I was the only person from my class to lead a single Iron-FE session for Mod-3 AND Mod-4. This is where I stood out from my peers this past inning, but it was the perfect opportunity for me specifically. My peers are amazing in a lot of different ways and excelled in areas where I wasn't able. I have such an amazing appreciation for my cohort and wouldn't be where I am without them. As I lead Iron-FE, they spurred me on and made me feel confident in my decision to take the reins.

In Mod-3, I lead four sessions and this inning I lead one every single week. I was the contact person for 1710 when they moved to Mod-3 and stumbled into becoming the de facto leader of Iron-FE. I got to teach JS, learn new solutions to problems I thought I had solved, and transitioned into a mentor figure for Mods 1 and 2. The feeling that I was helping people learn was my best moment at Turing.

I got excited about creating new problems for Mod 2 students, getting them comfortable with array prototypes and object manipulation. I used to be a tutor in college and, once I got past the initial uncomfortable feeling, I got excited to show up and see familiar faces. On my first week I had a Mod 1 student stop me and thank me for teaching. It was gravy from there on out. This was the best decision I made while at Turing and I couldn't be happier at the results.
  
## I know, I know. The code.

I had an idea of what I wanted to do for my capstone before I started Mod 4, which was an enormous advantage. I had my first client meeting in Week 1 and three more after that at the tail-end of Weeks 3, 4, and 5. This was a passion project for me: I followed through, had an amazing partner, and am incredibly proud.

Our client, Tracy Stackhouse, is like a second mother to me and she brought up the idea of an app over winter break while I was visiting their family. As I thought about it more and more, I knew it was what I wanted to do. The project was incredibly complicated, but I was committed and started working on it as soon as I could. Thankfully, Rob showed interest before BYOB and we were able to hit the ground running. That extra week of work was crucial to our success. In this time, we set the foundation for our backend and our definitional database.
  
## Setting up a real backend

As we got further along in the project, I decided to handle the tables and schemas while Rob started work on the frontend. The connections for the project were linear, but complicated. The original version of the schemas changed a number of times and the `processes` table alone had 150+ columns where data could live. This section of the project alone took me three to four days of straight work. It tripled the size of our server and quadrupled the size of our test file. Though I was eventually tired of the backend work, I have so much more knowledge because of it. I committed to using new migrations whenever there was a change, built an incredibly complex seed file for the test environment, and can now write backend tests with my eyes closed.
  
## That crazy BE comes with a side of crazy FE

With all of the data we had flying around from our capstone, it had to go somewhere on the FE. Rob set up the Redux store while I finished the BE endpoints. By the time I was finished, the frontend was pretty far along and I wasn’t sure if I would be able to hop in very quickly. I was wrong.

Though it took me a while to get my bearings with the frontend project, when it came time to start building the fetch requests and linking up the tables, I knew exactly where everything had to go. I built several helper files for multiples `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests. One button alone made four `POST`s and one `GET`, but I was able to set it up without any issues.

My biggest accomplishment, however, was recreating the 'thread connections' for our client. In their process, they use actual pieces of thread to show therapists how different actions or behaviors are connected, relating it to how different areas of the brain are connected. In their process, however, the brain was five pieces of paper sprawled out on the floor or a table. Conceptually, I thought the thread connections would be impossible to recreate in an application, but I was determined.

I took an Xcel spreadsheet with numbered associations and a copy of their process with um-teen different colors linking different areas and turned it into a clean and concise helper function. The `getThreadConnections` helper function takes in a rated process, removes the first three letters (which correlated to one of five possible domains), and travels to a matching data object holding a group of thread connections. This object holds a key that matches the incoming process exactly and return it's value, which is an array of other processes. Once this array is returned, it gets sent to the Redux store, which finds the thread connections and sets their value to `true`. Each process component on the DOM has conditional logic built-in to know whether or not it's been flagged as a thread connection. If it has, it gets a small green border. The process even knows not to highlight itself if it's already been rated.

Solving this puzzle in such a seamless way was my proudest achievement in Mod 4. The 'thread connections' were such a crucial part to Tracy's process that she was even photographed holding thread for a Polish magazine when interviewed about their treatment. When we did our last round of user testing with them, I didn't tell them we had figured out the 'thread connections'. When a connection fired, tt happened so quietly that they didn't even notice. Once they figured it out, they would rate something just to see if it's associated connection would get highlighted. When it did, they started laughing and couldn't stop thanking me.

That moment was my proudest moment as a developer thus far and I can't wait to have more like it.
  
## A greater appreciation for the BE and a want to learn

Learning the other half of the stack this mod made me really appreciate how crucial a backend is to a frontend. You can have something pretty, but if it doesn’t do what you expect and save the information you need, it won’t be used.

I felt lost in BE land for a while during our capstone, but once I was finished and got to hook everything up to the FE application, I had a much better understanding of how the FE was communicating with the BE. Building my own BE not only taught me more about databases and why they're so important, but gave me a deeper understanding for how frontend applications communicate with an API.

## Moving out of the basement

While I know Turing is a ‘code bootcamp’, the biggest lesson I’m going to take with me moving forward is that teamwork makes the dream work. Having owned my own business and wearing a million different hats, relying on other people is something I haven't been used to or comfortable with. Coming to Turing, however, I had to work with other people and cooperate to solve complex problems. While I know that I could solve most of these problems on my own *eventually* (hard emphasis on 'eventually') it was made so much easier by trusting in my peers and knowing that I could come to them for help when I needed it.
