# Katie Scruggs - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions
This Gear Up showed me how some of the things I've said in the past could have been offensive, and how it's okay to admit that and work to be better in the future. I also learned why some of the phrases that are said to me bother me. I think it's important that we have this shared vocabulary in our community so that we can discuss microaggressions when they happen, and the discussion starts on with everyone sharing a basic understanding.

#### The Attention Economy
I really enjoyed this Gear Up because it allowed me to reflect on how I spend my attention. Especially because I'm so busy at Turing, I find that I often don't spend my energy/attention outside of Turing on the things that matter most to me. This Gear Up also made me think about the ethics of advertising and what kind of product I want to contribute to as a career in the future.

#### Mod4: Be Your Own Ally
I enjoyed this Gear Up because I have been working on standing up for myself in a more consistent manner. My takeaway from this session was that it's okay to say something even when you're only bothered a little bit. That way things are addressed immediately and don't have time to fester.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I was an active participant in Joan Clarke Society and the Cold Outreach meetings. I continued to organize collaboration meetings with my cohort, including a feedback session for our personal projects after Winter Break and a practice session before Demo Night. I did a lightning talk at wrap-up and continued going to Code for Denver meetups almost every week.

This mod I wanted to push myself to reach out to mentors and other tech community members outside of Turing, and I am happy to say that I met with 10 mentors/community members and learned a TON about my future job search.
