# Katie Scruggs - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus this module was to learn best practices for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I could carry those basics with me through the rest of my learning as I add more complicated frameworks and skills. I also wanted to learn how to program with others in a collaborative setting. I feel like I have learned solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and I have also learned a lot about how to work on a project with a partner.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During this mod, I worked on four projects individually: Number Guesser, Static Comp 1, Static Comp 2, and Static Comp 3. I enjoyed completing these projects. Although the static comps were challenging for me, I was able to learn a lot about design and CSS positioning.

### Number Guesser
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiescruggs/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Description
For my Number Guesser, I created a two-player game where two people try to guess a random number. Points are awarded for the winner of each round, and the first person to 100 points wins the game. I challenged myself to add additional features for this project, and had a lot of fun. If I could go back and edit this, I would probably redesign the modal a little and would choose a better color for the "highlighting" that shows whose turn it is.

#### Evaluated By: Louisa
Notes/What To Work On:
- Really great job.
- Obviously had so much fun with this!
- A MODAL!!!!
- Code could use a refactor pass, but was thought through, well planned, and thoughtfully executed.

Scores:   
- Functional Expectations = Exceptional      
- COMP RECREATION / DESIGN = Exceptional        
- HTML = Proficient       
- CSS = Proficient        
- JS/jQuery = Proficient         
- Surprise and Delight (reminder: have fun!) = Hot Fire  

### Static Comp 1
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiescruggs/ks-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

#### Description
I created this layout with a yoga theme, using CSS FlexBox. I want to go back now that I have a better understanding of CSS and get rid of the strange margins and clean up the periwinkle/mauve situation.

#### Feedback from Louisa:
- get rid of all drop shadows
- adjust colors that are too similar (periwinkle/mauve should have more contrast)
- the buttons should probably not be set to the same width
- the background image should stay centered as the screen compresses
- get rid of strange margins as screen sizes shrinks
- buttons should be bigger on mobile screen
- make margins more consistent


### Static Comp 2
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/katiescruggs/ks-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

#### Description
I recreated this layout with a theme of Grimms Fairy Tales, again using CSS FlexBox. I enjoyed making this project and would like to try the invisible card trick next time instead of my double-div solution to aligning the cards to the left. 

#### Feedback from Louisa:
- Purple background color is too saturated and close to the blue, knock it back
- Make sure that castle icon is perfectly alligned
- Change the gray hover state to a red accent color so that it stands out better
- Pull down vertical ul to the baseline instead of moving it to the top left corner
- Center title on small screens so that the layout looks intentional

### Static Comp 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Following are my group projects: Linked List with Julie Hawkins, IdeaBox with Thomas Laird, and 2DoBox Pivot with Hugh Hartigan.

### Linked List
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julieahawkins/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Description
Linked List allows the user to create "bookmark" cards of links. This was the first project where I learned how to dynamically create HTML content and manipulate the DOM.

#### Evaluated By: Pam

Notes/What To Work On:
- Good naming/easy to follow code
- Very cognizant of design
- Use .on() instead of .bind() (the latter being deprecated as of jQuery 3.0)

Scores: 
- Functional Expectations = Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
- COMP RECREATION / DESIGN = Exceptional
- HTML = Proficient
- CSS = Proficient  
- JS/jQuery = Proficient  
- GIT & GITHUB = Proficient  
- Pairing/Collaboration = Exceptional  
- Surprise and Delight (optional category, but reminder: have fun!) = Hot Fire  

#### Partner Feedback from Julie
I think we made a great pair and our strengths complimented each other very well! I really appreciate how you took the time to explain the things we did separately to each other so that we both felt fully on the same page throughout and I always felt we were having fun and being respectful of each other. I think we both get so excited about the possibilities and ideas about the project and that sometimes led us into getting ahead of ourselves and losing some focus; I really liked how we took breaks to take a walk and regain our focus. We pushed through some tough problems together and I’m proud of what we accomplished as a team. Our project was awesome! I really enjoyed working with you!

### IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/t6r6l5/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

#### Description
IdeaBox allows the user to create cards of ideas that persist on the page on reload. This was my first introduction to local storage on the browser, which allows dynamically created elements to persist on page load.

#### Evaluated by: Louisa
Notes/What To Work On:
- make sure you're watching indentation! mind the little details
- well crafted code, could use a refactor pass (which is a good place to be)

##### Feedback from Thomas
Working together on IdeaBox was awesome! Your ability to pick up on concepts and implement them quickly was a huge part of why we were able to get ahead and finish all the phases of our project. At times I felt like I was getting left behind when you would figure a series of things out that would make a particular feature work and I didn't want to always stop our progress to get an explanation of your thought process. However, when I did do so, you were always quick to stop and give a very thoughtful and thorough explanation. In the future I would recommend making sure your partner is comfortable with things before moving on to the next as you do such a good job explaining. Even as I have progressed through 2doBox stuff this past weekend I have noticed how much better I understand some of the more complex concepts as a result of having worked with you. I appreciate you and hope we get paired up again soon!

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/HartiganHM/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

#### Description
For this project, Hugh and I received the code from another group's IdeaBox project and refactored it, then added additional features, like only displaying the 10 most recent cards, allowing a to-do to be marked "completed", and implementing a character counter. This was my first experience with working with someone else's code, and while I was at first intimidated, I enjoyed the experience of seeing how someone else had approached problems differently than I had.

##### Evaluated by: Pam

Notes/What To Work On:
- Functionality: All 3 Phases completed with extension for disabling button with 120+ characters - HOORAY!
- Good work w/the following:
     * Refactoring with JS so that no global variables, no anon functions, and that functions are concise/single responsibility. YAY for ARIA roles and good contrast on color scheme - contrast ratio passes accessibility tests in browser! Good naming with commits. Appreciate the index at the top of the CSS file. JS, both what is refactored and added to this project, is very readable and easy to follow. And YAY for one function to filter importance!

- Room for improvement w/following:
    * Add labels to inputs for ARIA. More specific naming on feature branches. Consider using a single class across several elements that share the same styles (media queries section) in CSS file. Leveraging/revisiting DTR when pairing is not going as planned - which includes clarifying roles and expliciting communicating concerns in a respectful manner. Communication (which includes listening) is key!

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

Although I had a fixed mindset in regards to academics growing up, I have developed a more growth mindset for learning. I am still trying to care more about how much I have learned and how well something is contructed rather than the evaluation scores a project receives. To help me with this, I am going to continue asking for help when I need it and will try to put less pressure on myself for the end project.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introversion and Extroversion
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/introversion.markdown)

I enjoyed this discussion of introversion and extroversion, especially how the discussion was framed as "tendencies" toward one extreme or the other rather than dividing people into one of two camps. I have always known that I was someone with introverted tendencies who needs time alone to reflect and allow my mind to think its clearest thoughts. This Gear Up reminded me that it is important for me to be able to vocalize to my colleagues what I need to get my work done, and also that it is necessary to compromise and also help extroverts process information in a way that is helpful to them.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

The discussion about cognitive load made sense to me. Sometimes when I am stressed out with school or work, I ignore other things in my life in an effort to reduce my cognitive load. However, I now know from experience that this does not end well for me. One day I look around and see that my living space is in complete disarray, which only adds to my stress. I want to allocate a certain amount of time and energy for keeping my life going, even if that means that I need to take away some time from learning code.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I was aware of some of the difficulties involved in being a woman in tech, but watching this video and getting the chance to discuss its implications with my male classmates was valuable. It made me realize that in order to change the overall culture, individuals in tech (of every gender) need to stand up for what is right. I am hoping to be able to stand up against discrimination in the industry once I get into the industry.

#### Case Study with Mod 4: The Art of Not Giving a Fuck
* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up was focused on determining what is a priority and what isn't in your life, and then acting accordingly. When I get tired and stressed, it is easy for me to lose sight of my priorities and begin to worry about things that I have no control over or things that don't matter as much. I would like to work on focusing my energy on things that matter and letting go of the rest.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this mod, I worked as an SAB member to lead cohort discussions and bring our concerns to the greater Turing community. I also organized and led review sessions so that our group could practice for Pentathlon together. At the end of the mod, I started reaching out to people in other cohorts, and I want to continue this trend throughout my time at Turing.
