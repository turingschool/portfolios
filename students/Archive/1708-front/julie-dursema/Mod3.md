## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I participated in SAB as a SAB leader and got to help reorganize the posse program. I've really enjoyed taking on a bigger role at retro. I really liked getting to meet mod1 as a class and I think it made them more comfortable asking us questions.
