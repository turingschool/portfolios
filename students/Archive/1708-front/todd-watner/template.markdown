# Todd Watner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Being entirely new to programming in any manner, I set out to accomplish a great deal. My main goal of beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript was achieved through the design of the curriculum, good instruction, and hard work. I was proud to succeed when I did, and proud to learn from my many failures. Other goals of mine, like meeting great people and networking, have been accomplished as well. Going forward, I aim to advance my skills in Javascript, learn new languages, and intensely network.

## A: End of Module Assessment

N/A

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Through the pre-work, books, and lessons to the static comps, number guesser project and online resources, I had an amazing time learning this past mod. These individual projects truly tested my ability to code.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/tw-number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was very difficult for me. I had missed a very important class which had introduced key Javascript concepts. This project was the beginning of my mod-long chase. However, this project was a strong start to my learn coding career and ultimately enjoyed it. Pairing was clutch!

Besides improving javascript (common theme), I needed to consider a difficult user by making my limitations strict.

#### Static Comps

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/tw-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The static comps were very challenging because I had little experience using HTML and CSS. The main challenges were page layout and how to breakdown HTML efficiently/correctly, working with flex and other strange CSS things, and managing time to successfully complete them.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My pairing projects were incredibly beneficial to my learning. Thanks to my instructors, I had knowledgeable partners who could guide me. I had no issues asking questions (and there were many) nor reaching out for help. Utilizing different pairing strategies was crucial to the importance of these projects.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MatthewArvidson/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

My partner and I worked very well together. He was understanding of my lack of knowledge and was willing to help me learn. In the end, our project turned out swimmingly.

Evaluation Feedback:
Code was a little rough and could use a refactor. Soft on syntax and need to work on fundementals. Good work and teamage.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/ideaBox-mrtw)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was very difficult for my partner and I. Countless hours were spent trying to get the javascript to work as intended. However, we persevered through the long nights and weekends with a good end product. He was also helpful in guiding me along the path to code enlightenment.

Evaluation Feedback:
Short on some requirements. Worked together to understand and valued learning.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

My partner and I managed to put out a nice product despite some serious lack of agreed-upon communication. We also got along well.

Evaluation Feedback:
Nice color palette. Broken functionionality. Redundant CSS. Lacking true understanding of javascript.

## D: Professional Skills

These sessions were eye-opening. I saw new perspectives and ideas that I will incorporate into my own time at Turing and beyond.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

This session showed me how growth mindset can unleash my true potential. We also talked about the negatives, like visualizing failure and viewing Turing as a competetion. To grow, one must envision success, have positive energy, and be willing to struggle for the learning.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

Cognitive load was the theme of this session. I found it very interesting how small details in my life contribute to a lack of producticity and potential. After this, I was more conscious about not wasting braining resources.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts

I was in the middle of the introvert-extrovert scale but closer to extroversion. I have experience with both extroversion and introversion depending on many factors. I can easily relate to both sides of the spectrum. This acts as a "yin" to my "yang" in that I never feel strongly towards either end. My career will benefit from my ability to chameleon to my surroundings.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

Code, the movie, was fascinating. I have read many articles pre-Turing about the issue as well. As is in my nature, I read as many sides of every perspective as I can. An interesting factoid I learned was that women in the technology field was booming before pop culture portrayed computers as nerdy/geeky and only for boys.

#### Case Study with Mod 4

We watched a very interesting video about artificial intelligence. In the video, they talked about how machines generate jobs, but also take jobs. In the current cycle, more jobs will be lost than every before. We also discussed our feelings on the good and bad of artificial intelligence, what we want to see, and other possible uses for it.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

When not entirely engrossed in programming, I was a positive person in the classroom and around school. When able, I interacted with fellow Turing students in a calm, respectful, and peaceful way. Building relationships, growing in knowledge, and leaving Turing a better place than when I came in is important to me.
