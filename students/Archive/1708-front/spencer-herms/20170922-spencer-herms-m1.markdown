# Spencer Herms - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to learn the foundations of JavaScript and object oriented programming as well as to vastly improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS.  I set out to challenge myself and rapidly learn more in a short period of time. I was also seeking a community to support me in my journey of learning, to give me an opportunity to help others learn and for a network of support in the future.  I wanted to set myself down the path of becoming a software developer and being in a better position in the future.  I have accomplished these objectives

## A: End of Module Assessment

After wrapping up static comp three I will pass the end of module assessments. I studied very hard and am satisfied my results of the DOM manipulation and JavaScript foundations / testing exams.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed completing the Number Guesser project and learned a great deal while doing it.  This project was an excellent introduction to to using some basic JavaScript.  I am satisfied of the results and proud of what I accomplished.

### Number Guesser

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/number-guesser

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

The goal of the project was too build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The project had multiple phases too accomplish, criteria to meet and a layout comp to follow.

### Static comp 1

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/sh-comp-challenge-1

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

This project expanded my knowledge and skill in the areas of HTML and CSS. In this project I began to have to consider responsive design. I enjoyed completing this project, learned a great deal and I’m pleased with the result.


### Static comp 2

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/sh-comp-challenge-2

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

This project built on what I had learned in the prior static comp and introduced a more complex layout.  I enjoyed working on this project, learned a great deal more and am happy with the result.


### Static comp 3

GitHub URL:  https://github.com/PreciseSlice/sh-comp-challenge-3

Original Assignment:  http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

In static comp three there is a great amount of detail on the page.  This was also a challenge to refactor the desktop page into a responsive layout.  I learned from the project to identify areas where efficiency can be improved as the CSS contain many lines of code.  Balancing studying for the evaluations and completing this project was a challenge for me.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The projection contained in this section were done in pairing with a classmate.  I enjoyed practicing collaboration and hearing the perspectives of my fellow students.  I learned a great deal and became closer to the members of my cohort.


### Linked List

GitHub URL: https://github.com/jdursema/LinkedList

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Linked List is a simple application that enabled the students to exercise what this had learned about jQuery and DOM manipulation.  I enjoyed collaborating with other students and learned a great deal.

#### Partner Feedback

“Spencer was a great partner to work with on LinkedList. He was very good about communicating, offering up ideas, and keeping a positive attitude throughout the project. We both felt less comfortable with javascript and jquery than html and css, so we decided to work together after school to get the js part done which was very helpful and allowed both of us to learn and better understand jquery. He was also great at staying on task and making sure we got everything done. Throughout the project he made checklists of what we had accomplished for the day and what we still needed to get done which was very helpful and kept us on task, but also helped me feel productive after a long day. When a crisis did come up at the last minute, he kept a level head, asked for help, and found a solution. One thing to work on would be speaking up more when we’re working on javascript. He understands it better than he thinks he does and it would be great for him to share more and talk through his ideas.”


### Idea box

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/IdeaBox

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Idea Box built on everything we had learned about HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery and DOM manipulation. This project also introduced us to using local storage.  The project also taught my partner and I about GitHub and merge conflicts.  I learned a great deal from this project and enjoyed completing it.

### Student: Spencer and Valentino
### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
### Notes/What To Work On:

- Merge conflicts that were not resolved with functional JS and updated CSS split onto two separate Git repos
- Filter working but full functionality not implemented for upvote/downvote
- YAY ARIA!!!!!!
- Practice explaining/understanding codebase to each other
- Nice job working around the hiccup from early on. You both had a positive attitude about using this as a learning experience, which was great!

#### Functional Expectations

* Novice    Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner    Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

### HTML

#### Accessibility

* Proficient    Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* Advanced Beginner    Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient    Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

### CSS

#### Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner    Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner    Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* Advanced Beginner    Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

#### Conditional Logic

* Proficient    Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner    Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

#### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner    Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner    Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### DOM manipulation

* Proficient    Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* Advanced Beginner    Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* Advanced Beginner    Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient    Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* Proficient    Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner    Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient    Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### PAIRING

#### Collaboration

* Proficient    Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

### Partner Feedback

Hey Spencer! I really enjoyed working with you last week. Thank you for being understanding with my schedule and I really appreciated how patient and calm you were when complications arise. I'm really having trouble coming up with improvements for you because I think we handled the rush, work load and errors pretty well. I guess I would challenge you (as well as myself) to communicate more specifically on what you're working on throughout the process. I think you established a great game plan and expectation on where we wanted to go with this project at the beginning which made me feel very confident about the work ahead. Looking forward to working with you again! :D


### 2DoBox Pivot

GitHub URL: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/2DoBox-Pivot

Original Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

2DoBox involved refactoring another groups code from the IdeaBox project and building upon it.  It was interesting to work with someone else’s code base. The project cemented all of the concepts throughout the mod.  I learned a great deal from this project and enjoyed working on it.

### Student: Rob and Spencer
### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
### Notes/What To Work On:

- Functionality - Made it through all 3 phases!

- Good work w/following:
Stylistic changes for 2doBox. Clear that you kept UX in mind with the buttons, color choices, and positioning of elements for mobile. Nice work with avoiding deep-nested if/else statements and global variables. Yay for ARIA!!! I love that you are using comments in your PRs and that your naming is specific on your commit/PR history. Sounds like pairing went well!

- Room for improvement w/following:
DRYing/refactoring functions in JS. Refactoring upvote/downvote into one single, dynamic function. Same for edit card/edit task. You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage or filtering for search like in lines 225 and 232 as any one unique card object should only be instantiated once. Redundant code on lines 177-179, 186-188, 195-197, and 205-207 that could be refactored.

## D: Professional Skills

Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

### Personal Development Deliverables: https://github.com/PreciseSlice/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1708-f/spencer_herms.md

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown

In this session the valuable tool of having a growth mindset was reinforced.  This was a great first Gear Up session at Turing as a growth mind set is needed to learn a great deal in a short amount of time. Believing you can do something and always growing helps you achieve more.


#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown

This session focused on the state of mind needed to learn and grow as well as the the reward    which comes with working hard at something and then seeing yourself improve. The session touched on managing your learning process and the roles your emotional and metal state can have on learning. This was another good session for the beginning of the program and helped me prepare and prioritize for the more difficult times to come.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts & Extroverts

GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

This session helped me get to know some other students more and caused me to reflect on my own personality. This session made me consider my strength and weaknesses, then pairing with others whose strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

GitHub URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown

I realized the majority of software engineers identify as male however this session showed me how large the problem is.  Once seeing the statistics I was surprised by how little diversity there is.  Not only is this an issue relating to people working in software development, the issue leads to further problems because only one group of people is making things for all people when this happens the user suffers.


#### The Robots are Coming

This session focused on machine learning and was very interesting.  It was good to be in groups with students from all of the different cohorts.  I had watched software take over tasks I used to preform manually at previous employers, therefore I related to the material.  This session cemented within me that we are on the verge of some major changes in how work is performed.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I worked hard to join the Turing community.  I made an effort first to get too know my cohort and then to branch out from there.  I have a made many new friending in the last few weeks.  I tried to help others whenever they needed help.  The pairing sessions were an excellent opportunity to get to know students outside of my cohort. I took advantage of many of the pairing session available. In between class and in gear up session I was able to meet and work with many other students.  The cohort as a whole came together very well and I am grateful for all of the effort we put into to helping each other.  I made an effort to help coordinate meeting outside of class for socializing and to work on course work. I cleaned up in the kitchen daily and very frequently made coffee.  It took some time to get my bearings and figure out how things work at Turing.  Next mod I plan on becoming more involved in the community at Turing as a whole as well as starting to make my way into the Denver software development community.
