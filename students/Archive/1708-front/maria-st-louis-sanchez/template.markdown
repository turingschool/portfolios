# Maria St. Louis-Sanchez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 1 were: Learn the foundations of JavaScript, challenge myself to always be learning and being open to other solutions, grow in my HTML and CSS skills and throw myself into the life of a developer. While the mod has been challenging, I'm proud of how much I've learned in just six weeks and have loved the challenge and the excitment of finally figuring out a tough solution.

#### Comments
- well done!
- JS was _very_ verbose in areas (specifically around appending the cards to the DOM). Refactoring would drastically reduce the number of lines of code and increase clarity/legibility
- well crafted CSS and HTML
- overall, code is well crafted and carefully considered. It is clean, and well thought through.

#### Feedback to me

“I sincerely enjoyed working with you on our first group project. I think our skillsets meshed perfectly as evidenced by our success. Your ability to pick up new concepts and apply them quickly seriously impressed me. I appreciated the enthusiasm with which you took on challenges. I would have liked for you to take more time with me to explain your thought process and knowledge more deeply as I was eager to learn from your insight but did not get a full opportunity to do so. In future projects I would make sure that your partner feels entirely comfortable with the work you’ve done before moving forward. This also may be a fault of mine in that I did not express the extent to which I would have preferred for you to spend time discussing things with me. All in all I had a phenomenal experience working with you and hope we get paired up again soon!”


### (Idea Box)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/mariastlouis/infobox)



#### Comments
- Hooray for finishing search functionality!
- Watch indentation/spacing in HTML, CSS, JS files... as well as commented out code. It can be difficult to read through the code at times due to this.
- Though communication went well with the project, always be sure to do a DTR before you start

#### Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

#### Git

* Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

#### Comp Recreation

* Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Collaboration

* Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### Feedback to me

Maria, you were a fantastic partner. I was so happy to be paired with you. I really appreciated how you got going on the HTML and CSS. We both had the opportunity to work on the JavaScript. I would recommend trying to not get in such a rush when things aren't working. Specifically, this happened when we ran into problems with the localStorage and we kept trying to plow ahead instead of trying to break down the problem to its smallest parts. Other than that I enjoyed working with you. And was very thankful you were so generous with your time being a wife and a mother. Thank you.

#### Feedback to me
It was great working with Maria and I'm really proud of the project we created and our ability to work together. I struggled with ideaBox, and it was great to have someone who understands localStorage, walk me through it, and getting it working on our ToDo Box code. I think we both have a tendency to stress out, and at some points, I think we fed off each other's stress, making each other more stressed. When something isn't going as planned, I think Maria could take a second, breathe, and then break the problem down into more pieces and take it one step at a time. With these projects, it's very easy to get overwhelmed and that can get in the way being able to think. On Tuesday, we both started to worry that we would get the project done in time. I think if we had both taken a second to destress and break the problem down, it could have helped make our project less stressful. With that in mind, the great thing about working with Maria is that she doesn't seem to get discouraged and works hard until a project is done.



## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Reflections to gear up sessions

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/mariastlouis/fbf66abc26524eea1ccabed84c562bd6)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I worked hard to integrate myself into the overall community. I constantly reached out to other mods for help and I was always willing to help out any classmates with any issues they may have had. I worked to always be a great pairing partner. I work daily to have a growth mindset and challenge my classmates if they try to shut down or give up. I worked to show my sincere gratitude to my classmates and mod 2 by bringing doughnuts.
