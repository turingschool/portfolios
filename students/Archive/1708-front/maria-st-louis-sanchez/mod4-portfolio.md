### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
 
My biggest achievement this module was finally learning the back end and putting everything together to make a comprehensive app. I came to Turing as a data journalist and I was torn whether I wanted to do the background - and work with data directly - or work with the front end and help people interact with it. I think my choice to do front end was the right one, but I still had a strong desire to work with data I had obtained myself. I believe very strongly in the idea of open public data so learning how to use APIs is really what opens up data to the world. 

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
My biggest struggle this Mod was getting everything done - specifically palette picker. We had to built a full-stack app in a week and didn't even learn how to do everything for the app until Thursday. This was a project that really almost brought me to my knees because it felt impossible to accomplish. I did finish it but I couldn't say I was proud of the work I had done. 


### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I think my background as a data journalist really sets me apart from my peers. I've obtained and cleaned data sets for my previous job and it was especially helpful this mod as I knew what kind of data sets were available for apps, I knew what was important in them and also how to clean them once we had them. 


### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? 
This mod reminded me of why I started Turing in the first place - back when I wanted to visualize data I had obtained. I spent the first three mods learning JavaScript and React and now I finally feel I can put everything together. Getting back to this showed me that I am hoping to be more of a fullstack developer rather than solely front end. 


How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Putting this all together was great. We've worked with a lot of APIs but now we can make our own. 


What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Growth Mindset - absolutely. I grew up and I was always good at school and got good grades. Turing was very much a struggle. I was not the best student in class and this did not come naturally for me. However, with a lot of hard work and believing in myself, it all worked out.
