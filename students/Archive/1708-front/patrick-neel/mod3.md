Headcount was a project using a messy set of data that we had to clean and then display using React. This project also helped sharpen our React skills.

### Movie-Tracker
*[Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project was extremely difficult. Luckily I had soild project partners and we were able to pull it off. This was the first project with Redux and React-Router. We used a moviedb API to pull the movie database info. And create users and sign in and show favorties. It was very hard, but I learned a lot.
