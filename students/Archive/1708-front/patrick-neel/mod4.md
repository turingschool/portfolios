# 1708 Portfolio Updates

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Learning Node and Express and testing them correctly. Also the the data visualization library High Charts on my and my partners own. Setting out ot make a project that felt leaving Turing on a high note and something that turned out well.
  
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Learning jQuery again was pretty tough. Especially since we didn't touch it since week 5 of mod1. Really made you appreciate React. The time line of the weekly projects was tough in that you only had four and a half days to complete the project. Time management was tough with projects, homework assignments, and job search stuff.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
Having a background in collegiant athletics. Especially a sport like cross-country skiing where you have yto push yourself and can't give up until the end. Technically I would say nothing. My classmates were all exceptionally talented and I was very fortunate to have them.
  
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
After this module it made me realize I really love the front-end side of programming. I can apprecaite the back-end and would like to get better at it.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
The biggest thing I learned at Turing was how to break down a problem and into smaller and more manageable pieces so the problem isn't as overwhelming. The ability to Google things correctly has really help you and if you don't know what you're looking for can really be tough. Lastly the ability to have a base line of knowledge where you can take the skills you have and learn other things.
