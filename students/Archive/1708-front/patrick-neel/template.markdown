This was our first project of the module.  To be completely honest it was a bit overwhelming, but with the help of classmates and the pairings I found my way and put together something I was pretty proud of for a first project.

## Static-Comp-1

The individaul projects were very nice to have entire creative libeties on something that interested you.

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/patneel87/pn-static-comp1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

I was really excited when I saw former Mod 1 students exapmles. It was also very nice to use the so much talked about flex-box. I was very happy with how my turned out. My first outing with the flex-box went very well.

## Static-Comp-2

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/patneel87/pn-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I had a really great theme for this one, but it ended up turning into a dumpster fire.  I figuratively ended up in flex-box hell. The same tool that had quickly elevated my first Static-Comp-1 and come to my aid. Had quickly turned against me. What did I learn not everything needs display: flex.  Also I got a much better handle on the realtionships between parent and children containers and how different properties interact.

## Static-Comp-3

* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/patneel87/pn-static-comp3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

From the early on set of this project I knew static-comp-3 would be atrociously difficult, and it lived up to the terrible conotations surrounding it. My biggest take away point is that indenting your HTML is quite helpful especially on a project of this magnitude. I vowed I would not end up in flex-box purgatory, and I did just that. I was also much more organized with my sections when I broke out the project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were great that you could work with someone depending on your ablities have them help you, or figure it out together. Or have the opportunity to explain something to someone while reinforcing your knowledge of the subject matter. 

## Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valentinovtino/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first partner project, and it went very well for the first one. My partner and I fell into the dreaded pitfall of dividing the project project into CSS and JS/JQuery.  Which was a terrible idea.  Because both people end up missing working on both things. The biggest thing I learned was how to work with someone while not being togther and github and git, which was kind of a learning curve to it. Also using JQuery for this project was very nice, and proved to be very benefical to the project.

#### (evaluation comments)

good work! Team embraced the struggle, overcame speed-bumps and frustrations, and came out the other side with a good project.
still a bit soft on fundamentals, keep practicing to really lock in syntax and build a really solid foundation.

#### (feedback to me)

Hey Patrick! I really enjoyed working on this project with you, you were fantastic!! I loved how dedicated you were with your time and how willing you were to try and fail with me haha. I would challenge you to not be afraid to ask for help to limit the amount of "wasted time." I think we both struggled with this actually because we really wanted to solve our own problems, but in doing so, we sacrificed time that could've been put towards getting through just a few more phases. Other than that, I appreciated all of your support and understanding with my schedule. Great job on tackling the CSS and responsive property, I'm really proud of our project and I look forward to working with you again! :D


## IdeaBox 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mariastlouis/infobox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was very similar to Linked List and this time around we utilized localStorage and JSON. Maria and I started off very strong. Then when we hit the local storage are progress stalled, but we pushed very hard to the end and turned in a project I was very proud of. Maria was very helpful and we worked very through the problems.  I was also able to contribute to the JS/jQuery which felt very ice. 

#### (evaluation comments)

Hooray for finishing search functionality!
Watch indentation/spacing in HTML, CSS, JS files... as well as commented out code. It can be difficult to read through the code at times due to this.
Though communication went well with the project, always be sure to do a DTR before you start

#### (evaluation scores)

Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
HTML

Accessibility

Advanced Beginner	Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Style

Advanced Beginner	Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
Implementation

Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Proficient	Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic

Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope

Proficient	Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Arrays

Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
GIT & GITHUB

Git

Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
Github

Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
PAIRING

Collaboration

Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### (feedback to me)

Great job Pat! Things got really tough for a bit when we couldn't figure things out and it felt like we were both staring at the screen not quite knowing what to do. But we both kept our cool thank God and got it done. I think this project showed us both that we need to learn more about objects and querying the DOM to find the selectors we need. I'd encourage you to keep on learning and and keep on finding new ways to solve problems.

## TÚ DÜ Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MatthewArvidson/pivot-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Todo box was a project that I really liked.  Because we had to finish the exisiting project and then move ahead with the functionality of the new one. I liked it because we got to work on the stuff that we did the week before, which was very nice and things that were unclear and helped clarify some things.  JSON and local storage made a lot more since working with this project, which was very helpful. I felt a lot more confident after the project. One aspect that was tough was jumping into an existing code base and switching over the naming conventions and still having full functionality. 


#### (evaluation comments)

had a bit of functionality to wrap up from ideabox, good job getting it implemented!
some indentation inconsistencies in HTML
media queries have
functions for showing importance levels redundant, good spot for a refactor!
great team work!

## D: Professional Skills

Professional development was a series of lessons desinged for us to work on how we think and interact with others in a constructive manner.  

### Gear Up

## Growth Mindset

* [Git Hub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This session was very helpful in ways that you should approach learning situations, and how to handle set-backs and problem solving. How to recognize the signs of closed mind-set and how to avoid them. Growth mind-set is definetly something that I have to be very congnizant about and continue working on.

## Working Styles

* [Git Hub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

We focused on introverted and extroverted personalities. I found it interesting that a person is neither completely one or the other. I defintely fall on the introverted side of the scale, but defintely have some extroverted when working on a smaller sc ale. I took away certain skill sets that are more tailored to introverted people, and how to work with people who fall on the extroverted side and vice versa.

## Defining the Relationship

* [Git Hub](https://gist.github.com/patneel87/85bc27308952d4ee21a9015d910824bf)

I hadn't really ever done any partner projects and this gear up was really important in that. Especially how to give constructive feedback. On the otherhand learning how to take feedback and not take it is a personal attack, but rather as way to learn and grow.

## StoryTelling and Strengths

I detest talking about myself. You have to be able to eloquently be able to make yourself marketable for jobs. It definitely helped. I for sure have some work to do in this department, but it was good to be able to practice it.

* [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/patneel87/b045a3b516e73a2463b70ee1f1899430)

## Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [Git Hub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

The video we watched was quite startling. I was appalled to learn some of the statics about women, and lack of computer science courses being taught at the high school. Going forward at Turing if you hear somethings that are degrading or offensive to shut it down. If you can't do it now it's probably not going to happen when you enter the work force.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community by going to all the guest speakers, and one of the spikes. Also taking advantage of the pairing opprotunities and getting to know other people outside of our cohort.
