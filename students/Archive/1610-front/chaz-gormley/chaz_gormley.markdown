# Chaz-Mykl Gormley - M1[repeat] Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Repeating Module 1 for me was about being disciplined and dedicated to completing this program, and becoming a Front-End Developer. The first time around many of the concepts, and the logic behind what we were learning - specifically in regard to JavaScript - was hard for me to graps. However, I believe having that prior interaction with it, enabled me to better understand, and utilize those very things this go round. As opposed to defaulting to my strengths in HTML & CSS, I challenged myself to build out JS logic/work prior to delving into the 'look' of the projects I was completing. 

Overall, this Module for me was a chance for me to prove it to myself that I CAN do this. While we can and will be evaluated by our instructors, and challenege by the program - at the end of the day - only WE as individuals can be honest with ourselves to accept where our skills truly lay. I can confidently say that I know what I'm doing, and that for me - was the goal. 

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Bree

### Progression/Completion

* 2.5: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 2.5: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

## B: Individual Work & Projects

While repeating Module 1 here at Turing, I ended up being able to work on two of the projects that I'd previously done as a paired project. In my opinion, being able to work on solo projects was extremely beneficial for the fact that there was no one to rely upon to pick up any slack, or solve problems that I could not. These challanges and feats aided me tremendously this go round, and increased my level of confidence in regard to programming and my ability to DO THIS, overall.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Having utilized poor group ethic during my first time in Mod 1, the work done in the following projects was a collective effort on behalf of myself and my collaborators. The first project 'Number Guesser', allowed me to not repeat the mistakes that partners past have done of delegating the HTML/CSS to one partner, while the other handles the JS. Being in that very same position prior, provided me with the ability to ensure that both Chelle and I had equal hands on the project - so that we both benefit and gain the knowledge thats to be attained from the assignment. 

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chelletuerk/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was an application that allowed the user to attempt to guess a random number between 1 - 100. Utilizing all the languages we'd been introduced to thus far - HTMl, CSS & JavaScript. 

### Reviewer: Bree

### UX/UI Expectations
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations
- 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 2.5 Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

## D: Professional Skills
A key component of Turing School is the focus placed on building rapport amongst the student body as well as, providing the tools to build interpersonal skills and professional development. There are endless opportunities to develop your personal brand, as well as your relationships in the developer community - and Turing not only makes it possible via the curriculum, but encourages it with the programs and events they put on. Outside of school sponsered events, there's an abundant amount of ways that I've been able to develop my professional skills through volunteer work and pairing sessions.

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

The discussion had around 'resilience' were great, within the group that I discussed these things with, many of us realized that we had failed to realize how resilient we had been - in life - until this talk. In addition to that it helped me to better frame the idea of what resiliency is, and how it has played a part in history and culture.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

# Chelle Tuerk
* Working with Chelle on the first paired project, "Number Guesser", was a great learning experience. Chelle's willingness to struggle through a project as a team, was EXTREMELY helpful! At times in this program we'll experience the feeling of being "left behind", with a partner marching along and completing many tasks, while you try to grasp the basics of certain problems. With Chelle, that was never a problem, as we both took time to explain to one another what we had worked on when we had our individual nights work to discuss from the day before. It would've been great to work together face-to-face on the project a bit more, and I've found that that has benefitted both of us greatly in the projects we've worked on individually, since "Number Guesser". With that in mind, Chelle and I were still able to turn in a great project and, more importantly, grasp the concept(s) behind "Number Guesser", which will surely come in handy as we progress in the program. Overall, the time spent working with Chelle was not only informative as far as the program here at Turing is concerned, but fun as well - Chelle is a great programmer and an amazing person - I look forward to working with her in the future, to see how far we'll both have come since our "Number Guesser" days.

### Being a Community Member

# Chelle Tuerk
* Chaz, I appreciate the effort you put forth in making sure all concepts of the project were understood to the fullest.  It is commendable that you insist on knowing the in's and out's of every piece of code.  You set the tone for a work ethic necessary to produce high-quality results.  I would've liked more time spent face-to-face, however, the time we did have with each other was extremely productive.  You are an outstanding example of someone who takes pride in their work and it was a sincere pleasure to work with you.

# Adam Rice
* During IdeaBox I was excited to be paired with Chaz as we had both had already completed IdeaBox once before. Chaz is a hard worker and was not afraid to trust me and break up some of the duties as we only had three days to complete the project. Chaz is also good at explaining how he resolved an issue as he worked out many of the CSS issues and minor js bugs we were experiencing on the final day. I feel that Chaz would benefit from increasing his pace when coding and writing faster.

### Playing a Part

Through Pahlka Posse, I've continued to look outward for ways I could bring more people into the fold of Web Development and programming in general. Karina Gonzalez, who is also a Pahlka Posse member had arraigned mentoring/volunteer work at the local Boys & Girls club, which involved teaching children interested to code via [Microsoft Kodu](https://www.kodugamelab.com/) and [Code.org](Code.org). Mentoring and volunteering are passions that I've pursued since I was a teen in high-school and through Turing & Pahlka Posse, I'm still able to enable this passion while at the same time engulfing myself in the new community I'm entering.
