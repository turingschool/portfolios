# Annastasia Psitos - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Wanted to learn more and make sure that I had a better comprehension and grasp of foundations and felt comfortable in what I was doing. I felt I left mod 1 feeling slightly shakey and I wanted to make sure I focused on those things.

- solid project
- could use some refactoring and changing the for loops to a filter
- look into changing switch statement to object or array.

#### Specification Adherence

## D: Professional Development

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/8OJws5OK/annastasia-psitos-job-tracker)

This is a useful tool, which would be more useful if I had an idea of what kind of company I want to work for.

#### Johari Window

* The completed deliverables were passed out to students.

It was nice to see the positive feedback, but it might have been helpful to have some negative adjectives, as well.

#### Agile Practices

* There were no deliverables to complete

I hope Sam gives a Spike session on Scrum! I think it would be very interesting and I would like to learn more about it.

#### Feedback/Triggers

* This was a very interesting session. I think it helped to be able to recognize the kinds of triggers we might be feeling and the reasons behind them. I  will be re-reading the article over break to try and better comprehend them.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I paired with Staci several times over the mod. She never hesitated to ask for further explanation when she didn't understand something the first time. While occasionally frustrated at not understanding something, which we all do, she didn't let it prevent her from working hard. She is very proactive in reaching out for help from as many sources as possible and in seeking help from beyond the Turing community as well. I think a good next step for her would be to trust her own abilities and have confidence in her work.

Pairing with Josh was difficult for me. When we started the project I thought we would work well together, but we have very different pairing styles. I frequently felt like I wasn't participating in the project, even if we were sitting right next to each other. I feel like I could have tried harder to engage and push our project along, but I also felt that Josh wanted to work on his own as much as possible. This was frustrating because I wanted to be more active, but I didn't know what direction we were going in. Additionally, I had stated during our DTR that the weekend before our project I would be almost completely unavailable and by the end of Friday we were no where near completing the project. I recognized, too late, that I should have reminded Josh earlier of my commitments. I like Josh as a person, but we aren't the most productive pair.

It is the best chat app, the greatest chat app. Working with Dan was an experience I would happily repeat again. He communicates well and is very organized. I appreciated that he wanted to start the project by wireframing and making sure we were both on the same page as far as overall set up. We both drove an equal amount which I think helped both of us further our education. He was always up front about scheduling, which allowed me to plan, as well, which I appreciated. I can't think of any pressing things that need improvement. Keep up the great work!

Mike L is an excellent partner. He communicates well and clearly, and does his utmost to make sure everyone on the team understands before moving on. He does not hesitate to take on the hardest tasks, but encourages his teammates to take them and push themselves if they want to. He is always willing to help. Sometimes, I think he takes on too much himself, but I think that if he was in a stronger group or every member of the team pulled their weight equally, it would not have been a problem. I would gladly work with Mike again.

### Being a Community Member

Project: Weatherly || Working with Anna on Weatherly was a fun experience. Anna was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing, take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer, and she was willing to ask for help from instructors. I like that just hours before our assessment Anna was still making improvements to the application. - Adam R

I have paired with Anna multiple times over the past few weeks. In fact I find her to be so helpful that I keep booking her time! She is patient and knowledgeable and goes out of her way to ensure that she is helping you. I really found the way she explains thing helpful. She has helped me strengthen some of my foundational knowledge which is so important moving forward. She is also a calming person to be around and in addition to her technical expertise, her kindness is apparent. She is great at explaining things in the smallest steps while making you think for yourself to come to a solution. I only have positive things to say about Anna and consider myself VERY fortunate to have gotten to work with her. - Staci M, Mod 1

Firstly, chatapp 1C-809 forever. AOL Instant Messenger won't know what hit em. I appreciate your level headed approach to the project, ability to analyze and troubleshoot through the development cycle, and your patience as I tried to solve little hiccups in the implementation. Your organization and scheduling was very efficient as well. I think we spent equal times driving the code along, which I appreciated as well. I can't think of an immediate area of improvement to suggest, you were a very well rounded pairing partner. -Dan G

Anna is great to work with! She's a hard worker, open communicator and asks great questions. She's not afraid to say when she doesn't know something and seeks to understand the answer as well as the process to get to it. Would gladly work with her again. Keep practicing. Keep pushing! - Mike L

I worked with Anna on our first project, ToDo Box Pivot, and I thought it was a success. She seemed to have struggled a bit in mod 1 but upon working with her in mod 2, she seemed to have put in the hours and was really understanding the material. As a result she was willing and able to complete the features she took on. She also did a very good job communicating, not only with her ideas but with explaining me into the project. It took no time at all to sit down with her and get my brain into her code. One thing I did find a little frustrating was on the final day before the project was due, you weren't able to make it in. I think at some point you mentioned that you had a prior engagement but I didn't remember that until the day of. Another reminder would have been welcome so that we could have made arrangements to complete the project before that last day. Other than that, solid project. It was a pleasure working with you. - Josh S

The thing I found most helpful about pairing with you was how you helped me slow down and break things into smaller chunks. You really kept me from getting ahead of myself. - Julian Kyer (1611)


### Playing a Part

Member of SAB, paired with some Mod 1 people

### Gear Up

Microaggressions - This was a very interesting gear up. While I was visiting my parents, the subject came up and the knowledge and definitions I had gained during the session came in very handy!

Journey Mapping (did not attend: had doctor's appt that ran late.)

Grit - An interesting investigation. I know I have grit and resilience, though, so perhaps not as useful as it could be. It was an interesting exercise to think about how we can take something that has become kind of habit and change it, bring our passions to it, so it becomes new and exciting again. I also followed a link in one of the articles that took me to the online test being run by the University of Pennsylvania, which was interesting, as well.

## Final Review

### Notes

### Outcome

Build new features on a project, write stories - when the story is complete, run your linter, check your tests, refactor, commit - and repeat. Do exercisms and then compare your answer to 3 to 5 others.

Do more reps, it's always good.
