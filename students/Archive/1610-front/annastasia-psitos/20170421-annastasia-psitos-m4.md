We got a 3.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### BYOB

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/apsitos/HappyHourAPI)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

This project was a individual project to experience building a back end. I initially had some trouble with testing, but it turns out I just need a little time away from the project to figure out what the issues were.

Feedback to me: 
Working with anna was a real joy. We worked together on JetFuel and I had absolutely no idea what was going on. She was the real MVP. She was patient with me when i was slow to understand what was going on when building an api. She works incredibly hard and has become a very strong developer. Thanks for being patient with me Anna. I'm sorry It took until after the project was due to really start to understand node. You're awesome! - Mike Z

Feedback from me: 
  I enjoyed working with you on Jet Fuel. I’m sorry that I wasn’t able to explain things well enough for you to understand earlier in our project. But I’m really proud of you for pushing through and working really hard on this project. You definitely understood what we were doing by the end of the project which is great! 

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/StephanieEA/savery)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/apsitos/HappyHourAPI)

This was our Electron app. Steph, Gabi, and I attempted to build a desktop app that would keep track of online recipes, allow the user to keep a running grocery list, and set a timer for cooking times.

Feedback to me:

I felt that working on Savery with you was the most well-organized project that I've worked on this module despite working with an unfamiliar framework. You did a great job at owning the data storage object, and we all were able to work through the confusing process of storing data. Overall I found our workflow to be very cohesive. For the most part, tasks seemed to be evenly divided and we took the time to do stand-ups to get the status of each task and to plan our goals. - Gabi Procell

It was awesome to work with you in Mod4 after last having worked together in mod1- We have come so far! I know you had some reservations about taking on a divide and conquer approach and I was impressed with how gracefully you managed tackling the more challenging aspects of this projects development. It was also interesting to see how we work at different speeds and I’m really grateful for you being patient w/me in the pairing process. Our git communication/pr’s were the best I’ve taken part in yet and I really value your ability to communicate on and offline. Rock on!!! Thanks for being an awesome team member! - Steph Andrews

Feedback from me: 

  To Steph: I loved working with you on Savery. I think our group communication was excellent, we divided work well, and we had a good project as a result. When I got too far off into the weeds, you were very good at stepping in and pulling me back. Our git communication and gif game was on point! Thank you for working with me!!
  To Gabi: Working with you on Savery was great. I think we did a great job a dividing work and supporting each other when needed. Our communication was excellent and while we didn’t end up with everything we wanted our app to be, we still had a strong project. Also, our git communication and gif game was on point!

Community feedback:

As a whole, we did an amazing job knowing what needed to be worked on in pairs and what needed to be broken out into individual tasks. We kept our workflow sane (for the most part) and didn’t really have any major issues until the last day. Elijah definitely took the lead in terms of staying on track and making sure people had things to work on. Anna and Gabi did an amazing job working on wireframes in the first day to make sure we all knew what we would need to build out first and what was most important. Elijah, you, Bekah and I worked on reformatting your database that first day and it was really awesome to be able to work through your code with you. We all had a hand in every part of the project, which was super awesome to see. Bekah, you took the lead on forms which a huge thing to tackle and it looks and functions so well! It was really awesome that we all met at Thump on Saturday and just sat and worked separately but together on all our stuff. That day was huge and the project really started coming together. I’m super proud of our capstone and hope that it’s a thing that will live on 4evah. - Devin Beliveau

We did a great job in the beginning of the project with communicating as a group on how we wanted our UX/UI to look. From that point, we started to assign tasks to others and pair or work individually. After the first few days, I feel that we suffered from not doing a DTR session or appointing a PM. Some of the tasks were bundled together, making it hard to break things into smaller components for others to work on. While I was struggling with some portions, I did appreciate Elijah, Devin, or Anna pairing with me to help figure out some issues. In hindsight, I wish that we had been able to plan better and assign tasks in a more efficient manner. I feel like I got swept into the role of picking up small tasks, which is still valuable. Perhaps involving everyone in the API planning at some point would have made everyone feel included on all aspects of the project. At the same time, we were working on a huge project with a tight deadline which left little time to catch everyone up on everything. This was a large project with a large group, and there were bound to be some conflicts, but I do appreciate our time together. - Gabi Procell

I think our capstone group was awesome. Like a couple of us have already said, it would have been best to DTR, assign a PM, and stick with waffle. I think our product turned out great but we could have worked a bit more on our organization. Overall awesome job to everyone, I don’t think we could have done it without everyone’s 100% effort! We rock. -Bekah Lundy

Our Capstone turned out better than I could have expected!  A large team presented both opportunities and challenges. The positives really shown when watching Gabi, Anna, and Devin take on auth0, which was completely new to all of us, and get it implemented.  It was also really beneficial to bounce ideas off each other.  I loved that we each at some point relied on someone else to help us overcome a hurdle.  That’s teamwork. That said, some of the challenges related to communication.  A DTR and better organization would have definitely helped.  There were times when I wasn’t sure where people stood on certain things or where they might be struggling.  I challenge our team, including me, to make sure we are continually updating people on what we are working on and where we might need support. In conclusion, we delivered a great product and pushed through the end (which is tough this late in the game).  Thanks to everyone! - Elijah Williams

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project. I appreciate that you all were tolerant of my schedule. The work Devin, Elijah, and Bekah put into the logic of the project was outstanding. Reformatting the database, setting up the pop ups, and passing data around were huge tasks and they look great. I think my biggest regret is that we didn’t use Waffle better. We were really good about putting issues in and closing them, but not good about following them around and actively assigning work. As a result, I think the work was fairly uneven and I regret that I didn’t take a more active role in building out the components. It felt a little like Gabi and I were left picking up whatever was left at any given point, which was occasionally very little because so many things were tightly bound to each other. That said, Elijah did an excellent job as de facto PM checking in with people and giving direction when requested. I think that as a whole our communication and collaboration was good despite some people very clearly wanting to work alone. There’s an unfortunate balance that needs to be struck between ensuring everyone is on the same page and just getting the work done. When there are slower and/or less assertive people on a team, it’s difficult to know when those people need encouragement, when they need to step up, and when they just need to sit back and let the project get done. All that said, I’m really proud of this project and grateful for all the work you all did in making it work so well. Thanks for having me as part of your team! - Anna Psitos

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/pull/25)

Planning and leading the final Gear Up of the mod was a good experience. I knew that Beth did a lot of work to set up each session, but having to rework one really drove the point home. I also enjoyed moderating one of the smaller groups during the discussion.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Led final mod Gear Up on Automation with three other Mod 4 students. Paired with Breana Knight once or twice to help her with React.
