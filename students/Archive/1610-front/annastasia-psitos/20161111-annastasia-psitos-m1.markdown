# Annastasia Psitos - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to enter a new career. Enrolling at Turing was my way of keeping myself accountable for my work, while being part of a supportive community that also believes in giving back to the community. To this end, I wanted to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and be able to construct simple websites. I was looking forward to learning more about the Turing community, but was unsure I'd be able to participate much, given how much I knew I would have to work to learn and understand the subject matter.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2.75
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Bree
Anna has progressed quite a bit in her grasp of javascript. I would like to see improvement in ability to break out code into logical components more quickly. Not just from a function perspective, but specifically faster on leveraging variables correctly and as a helpful piece to break the problem into steps.

Use of pseudo code is good, but could use some improvement in breaking down into even smaller steps.

Anna will retake the assessment.

### Progression/Completion

* 2.5: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 2.5: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I'm not entirely sure what our individual projects are. On the work we did in class or as homework, I did not complete many of the exercises. I will be finishing with Mythical Creatures over the weekend with my mentor, after beginning again for practice. While on intermission, I hope to go through all of Dead Presidents and the Unicorn site. I have difficulty prioritizing when everything seems important, but the 'smaller' exercises tend to be set aside in favor of the paired projects with given deadlines. Therefore, I hope to complete all of them and do additional work on exercisms between modules.

My [Mythical Creatures](http://www.bellydancedigs.com/fusion-2pc-knicker-pant.html) repo is here.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### Number Guesser

* [Number Guesser Repo](https://github.com/apsitos/NumberGuesser)
* [Project Description](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)


#### Evaluator: Louisa

#### Specification Adherence

#### UX/UI Expectations
3.25 - some layout bugs on iPhone 5, otherwise well executed.

#### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


#### Comment:
They got off to a rocky start on the first day of the project and didn't balance the work/effort equally or fairly. They regrouped and recovered very strongly, and both made a big effort to work together and learn from the project and pairing experience. Could have a been a discouraging project, but they turned it around and ended very positively. Great job!

Feedback to Me:
"This feedback feels like it's so old but really our project was just a few weeks ago. The only thing I can think of is that we could have communicated better outside of class, mostly on my part. I really enjoyed working with you and sorry again for taking over the JS. It was really awesome to see you take your learning into your own hands and redo the JS side of the project. I hope we work together again in the future so I can redeem myself as a better partner." - Justin Wood

#### Linked List

* [Linked List GitHub Repo](https://github.com/StephanieEA/LinkedList/branches)
* [Project Description](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

NB: We took the weekend, as permitted, and updated our repo, but neglected to resubmit the project.

#### Reviewer: Bree
#### Notes:
Students may take the weekend and resubmit project for review on Monday for revised scores.

#### Functional Expectations
- 1: Application does not meet the requirements in Phase One.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

#### Workflow
- 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

#### HTML Style
- 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style
- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Feedback to Me:

"I appreciated the research you put into our project.  When we weren’t sure about the next step, you were quick to look up different possibilities we could follow.  It was easy to communicate about our goals and the challenges we faced with the code.  I appreciated your flexibility with meeting times/places.  I also appreciated your positivity.  For constructive feedback, I think we both learned about the necessity of asking for help when necessary and probably should have reached out for more assistance." - Stephanie Andrews

#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box Repo](https://github.com/apsitos/Idea_Box)
* [Idea Box GH Pages](https://apsitos.github.io/Idea_Box/)
* [Project Description](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)


#### Evaluator: Bree

#### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### HTML Style

- 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS Style

- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

- 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

- 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Collaboration

- 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

Feedback to Me:

"I had a really great time working with Anna on Idea Box. We both struggled a little getting started, but once we had some basic code on the page we hit a stride and worked together well to get things done. We split a few tasks and I was impressed with how well Anna solved some of the problems we had. I think she knows a lot more than she thinks she does should be more confident in her work, because it's awesome!" - Devin Beliveau

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

  I believe it is very important to vote in every election. I recognize that many people think their voice doesn't matter, or they don't have time, or many other reasons, but every issue and candidate has or will have an effect on your life. It may not be direct, but we all operate in this country together. And if you want to get things out of it, you have to put work in. To create a better-educated public, I believe that civics should be a requirement in all high schools. You can't expect people to participate if they don't know how their vote and their role fits in the larger picture. And if they are unaware of how the system of government works, they will be angry and frustrated at the wrong parts.

#### Introversion v. Extroversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

  The video was interesting and prompted some interesting discussions. I think it really helped some of our cohort members understand the introvert personality better, even though most of us are introverts. It helped both sides realize ways they could meet more in the middle and possibly even become more like the other, creating a more 'balanced' individual.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

  The idea of reframing as a way to have a more positive outlook on difficult situations is a very good way of building resilience and of increasing overall optimism. The rebuttal to the New Yorker article was possibly well-intentioned, but by comparing a cold and rainy day to a childhood with an absentee father and alcoholic mother struck me as incredibly entitled. Yes, it was a good example of a way to reframe a bad situation, but it doesn't necessarily show how a child in such terrible circumstances would develop the resilience to thrive in spite of them.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Feedback I

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md

  The article Allison brought in was very interesting and quite useful. While I don't know that I've actively used the knowledge in class, I have tried to keep the points in mind and hope to reread the article in the coming weeks. I do believe that the information would be helpful if fully implemented by everyone, but that is something each person needs to take on themselves. For myself, I hope to take some time for self-reflection to determine what type of feedback I need the most.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md

  I thought this session was very helpful. Walking through how to DTR and having a template to work through helped all my pairs start off with a strong start. I need to get more comfortable at voicing disappointment and frustration, but that is also something I need to work on in general. I expect to become more comfortable with my cohortmates as we all get to know each other better, which will make any kind of discussion easier.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding I

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md

  I have a lot of work to do to align my personal brand. It is not anything I have ever spent much time on and while I have all necessary information, there may be too much information. I would like to streamline my LinkedIn and personal site to be more concise.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding II

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Justin: Thank you for all the work you did on this project, especially all the JavaScript you did to make our project work as well as it did. I know we both had some communication issues at the beginning, but I appreciate that you came to me directly so we could talk things through and that you grabbed a pairing session for me! I think your idea of us each working on the parts that we are weaker on is an excellent one and I recommend we both try and integrate that into our next projects. Your teaching style also improved and I was grateful that you were able to walk me through all the JavaScript steps so I could understand it and made me define things, which solidified them in my head.

To Stephanie: I appreciated how easy it was to communicate about the project and goals and about issues we were having with the project. I also appreciate that you were willing to break after school and meet up later for as long as it took. While we learned that we should have asked for help earlier, I am glad that you didn't just give up when things got difficult, but kept plugging away at code and research to try and find the answer.

I gave feedback to Devin, but forgot to copy the text before I submitted the form.
