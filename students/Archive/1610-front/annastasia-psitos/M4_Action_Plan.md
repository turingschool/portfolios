# Template: Module 4 Action Plan
  This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)  

## Module 4 Goals
  By the end of Mod 4, my goal is to have a job offer.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
  In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
  - I will have a solid, clean resume.
  - My personal site will be up to date and functional.
  - My github will be rearranged so the projects I am most proud of will be at the top.
  - I will identify at least one meet up group that I will attend regularly.

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
  How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?
  - I will refine my Mod 3 personal project and begin building the mobile extension, which will require my learning React Native. If the Firebase extension was not completed, that will be added first.

#### Opportunities Research:
  How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?
  - Once I week, I will check the jobs board of Built in Colorado to look for openings.
  - Knowing that most job opportunities do not reach job boards, I will attend at least one meet up regularly (see Strategy section) and get to know the other people there.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
  Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?
  - I have already reached out to several people, but I will ask my mentor (an alumna) and other grads about their strategy.

#### Personal Branding  (A personal branding section is optional) :
  How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?  
  - I don't know. I'd rather no worry about personal branding right now, though I'm sure it would help inform how I set up my personal site.

### Timeline:
  What will you do when?  
  - By the end of the break I aim to have my personal site redone in React.
  - By the beginning of the first week of Mod 4, I hope to have my resume broken into smaller parts for easy insertion into a better format
  - By the end of the first weekend, my resume will be in a format that I am proud of and can be sent out.
  - The second week I will review the companies on my Trello board, if I haven't already updated it, and identify contacts. I will also remove companies in which I am no longer interested and add any other companies I have learned about since my last update.
  - I will begin sending out applications as I read about or hear about jobs. Once my resume is updated, I will send my resume to the people who have already requested it upon graduation.

#### Module Tasks:
  What will you do throughout the module?
  - I will work hard and try not to burn out.

#### Weekly Tasks:
  What will you do throughout each week?  
  - Make scheduling mistakes by attempting to continue to have a musical life that will interfere with school. I will continue to minimize the amount of time music takes away from my schooling and will spend that time focusing on JS basics and learning Sass.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
  What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!  
  - I would like her to look over my resume once I know what will be going in it and I have a rough idea of format.
