# Annastasia Psitos - M3Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to be more confident with my coding. Even though I spent most of the module thinking I was behind and didn't know what I was doing, the evals and tests I did at the beginning of this week made me feel a lot more confident in my ability.

## Rubric Scores

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**:
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**:
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**:
*   **D: Professional Skills**:
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**:

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

UX/UI
	- Replace find restaurant btuton with result - and  'regenerate' type of thing
	- Pick a font style consistancy
	- Divs and relative position will make the font not opaque
	- Button CSS
	- Spinner/Waiting

CODE
	- If 20 bars - save that number, slice it out, keep regenerating from local array until 20 bars are done, THEN fire off new api call.

TESTING
	- check out boilerplate lesson and mod 2 testing hard stuff lesson

README
	- Update readme to indicate that the project is in progress (to justify skipped tests and comments)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### PreWork
Deliverables:
- Write up a summary of the pieces you completed.
- Looking back on the pre-work, what did you find useful in terms of preparation for the material covered in Module 3? What do you wish there had been more/less of?

* [Wes Bos JavaScript30](https://github.com/apsitos/JS30)
  * This was a fun way to review JavaScript and to learn new ways to use the library. I don't know that I can do any of it on my own, but I'm glad I have these to look back on and review.
* [Wes Bos Learn Redux](https://github.com/apsitos/LearnRedux)
  * I enjoyed getting to work with Redux before we got instruction on it. However, I didn't really understand what we were doing because he moves pretty fast. I think that now we've done a project in it, I could go back and do this again and solidify what I learned.
* [NodeWork]
  * The Express.js work was awful. The only way to accomplish this assignment was to watch the videos, which felt like cheating. I did not find this to be a useful part of pre-work at all. It was interesting that it all had to be done in the terminal, and I appreciated getting more experience with that, but I think that might have been the only real benefit.

### UI/UX Homework
* [Homework Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1610/mod-3/homework-submissions.md)

### Walker Texas RangerBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/apsitos/ChuckNorris)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

This was a solo project to use React and API calls. I definitely struggled more than I feel I should have at this point, but I also did not ask for help as soon as I should have to help me progress.

Student: Annastasia Psitos
Notes: A bit light on the feature implementation as we ran into some bugs that prevented all the functionality from falling into place.  Good work trying to test the features and components that were in place, and solid effort on design though not 100% polished.

#### Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

####Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Redux Weather Project

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/redux-weather-app)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)


##### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

##### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


##### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

##### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### remEMBER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

This project was to teach us Ember and better GitHub workflow. As you well know, I do not like Ember. It was very difficult to keep track of where things needed to be and why. I'm glad of the exposure to it, but I do not think it needed to be such a long project. Part of that, though, was that there should be three people approving PRs. It's too much work for just two. (In fact, Buss and I still have a PR outstanding. And we had other functionality waiting!)

## D: Professional Skills

### Personal Project
#### Restaurant Locator
#### Pitch

This is an app that will help you choose a restaurant based on your location when you can’t make a decision.

#### Problem

Denver has a lot of good restaurants. Sometimes there are too many to choose from, you’re new to town, or your dining companions can’t agree.

#### Solution

This app will use the Google Places API to search for restaurants nearby, based on your geolocation. It will then randomly select one and display the result.

#### Target Audience

This app can be used by anyone who can occasionally be overcome by decision fatigue.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [Commonality Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
1. If at least 1/3 of hires are more like their hiring manager, it could increase diversity, but not by much
2. Diversity quotas are a good way to start. By bringing in those who are competent, but not like the majority, you can teach tolerance and understanding. However it is very difficult to react the quota immediately and the minorities hired at the beginning might feel very isolated. This could cause quotas to be unattainable if the isolation remains too long: minorities will not want to remain in their positions.
3. Not teaching bias and hate would be an excellent start to improving diversity.
4. It is important for Turing to seek to include those who are not like us as individuals. It is also important to take an active role in discouraging bias.

* Automation Gear Up Markdown is definitely not the same one we looked at. I believe we just watched two videos and discussed them as a group, therefore there are no notes.

* [UBI Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

As we become more technologically advanced, more people will lose their jobs to automation. What few manufacturing jobs are left will in turn just become people who oversee the machines, until machines can oversee the machines. As a result, there will be more and more people who are unemployed and unable to be employed.

UBI isn’t a foregone conclusion, as there are large political hurdles to cross, but it will be important to figure out what is going to happen to the people who lose their jobs to technology. But society at large needs to be educated about the reasons for UBI and what automation is doing for jobs.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Staci was instrumental in helping me retake headshots so I could update all my personal sites and my alumni profile. I do not enjoy having my photo taken, but she was supportive and encouraging and I was very pleased with the results. She has also been excellent emotional support when I've been having difficulty with classwork and the stress seems to get to me.

Bekah and I worked together on the weather redux project. She isn't afraid to try things when she doesn't know the answer and is also a good researcher. We only paired a few times on this project, but I enjoyed working with her. When I was having difficulties with our third team member she was encouraging of my dealing head on with the issue. My only suggestion to her would be to trust her own knowledge. Bekah knows quite a lot and is a very good programmer, but as with many of us, doesn't always trust that she knows what she knows.

'My feedback is related to the Redux project we worked together on.

I recognize that I started things off badly by having commitments that took me away from work the first two afternoons of work time, but I always tried to show up after that ready to work and collaborate. I was hoping we would stay late Tuesday night to work on things, but you (Sam) preferred to go home and do research. I should have done more on my own without reference to you or Bekah, but I have been on many teams, both professionally and in school, where people duplicate work because no one bothers to discuss what needs to be done until the work has been completed and I did not want to step on anyone’s toes. In retrospect, this was the wrong tack to take, and I apologize.

When we all worked together and I did try to participate, you were dismissive of my answers, even when they were the right ones. This made me feel not valued or wanted, even though I wanted to be an active part of it. I had hoped that as the week went on and we divided up more work, I would be able to take a more active role on my own, but you always seemed to volunteer for the larger chunks. I do regret that I did not contribute to much of the codebase, I didn’t stand up for myself more, and as a result you did a majority of the work. I don’t know if you didn’t trust me to do the work or if you simply wanted to make sure you understood the process on your own, but it seemed to me that you wanted that control.

I think my largest piece of feedback is to actually listen to all members of the group and encourage participation, even if you think they have nothing to contribute. They might surprise you.'

I was really glad to work with you (Jeff) on this project. It was very helpful to work with someone else who prefers to pair and someone who is much better at handling stress than I am. I have a tendency to take things too seriously and to internalize a lot of stress, but working with you helped me feel less stressed about the project, even when things weren’t working correctly. I was also glad to work with someone whose outside life is also busy; it meant we were very focused when we worked together and we were both happy to make accommodations for each other’s schedule. We worked very well together and I look forward to working with you again in the future!

### Being a Community Member

I worked on the redux weather app with Anna. Anna was a very hard worker and is very good at researching and learning about the topics in our project. Anna and I only paired a few times on this project. Anna is very open, which is helpful for when I make mistakes. The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is to try to open to others opinions and thoughts, and to speak up right away if you do not feel that you are being heard. That way, we can solve problems very early on! I am glad we got to work together this mod! - Bekah Lundy

Anna was an amazing support to me in Mod-1 and continues to be throughout the program. She goes out of her way to be available to me when I need help. She has also been my ear and emotional support to help me through Turing. I don't think I could make it this far without her! She is always encouraging, honest, knowledgeable and kind. - Staci McWilliams

'My feedback is primarily focused on constructive feedback from the redux project we worked on together with Bekah.

'I think the main tension/frustration I felt - especially early on in the project - was what I perceived to be a lack of commitment to contributing to the codebase we were building. I know you had commitments that kept you from pairing with Bekah and I during the first few afternoon/nights of the project but my expectation was that you’d be making up for it by contributing to the codebase at other times. This was a project that had specific goals around git workflow and divide and conquer and I didn’t get the impression that you were interested in working on the project unless it was paired - something that wasn’t possible for the first few days because of your schedule. As a result, I thought the workload/contributions from the group were pretty unbalanced - especially early on - and I think it created tension.

'I think my main piece of feedback, based on the above, is that I think your locus of control can sometimes be a little too externally oriented. At times, I felt like your assumption was that we all needed to pair to get anything done and that, if we weren’t together, you weren’t going to contribute. From the perspective of a team member, this was frustrating to feel like I was put in a position where I had to spend more of my time picking up the slack. For example, I did the majority of the CSS - after Bekah did the initial setup/styling. I felt like that was a place where you could have done some more of the work when you were having trouble with other parts of the code.

'I am happy to discuss any of this with you if you’d like and I am sorry for not sharing it earlier.' - Sam Johnson

'Was glad to finally get to work with you Anna! Was wondering if we'd ever get paired together :) Despite neither of us liking Ember, we did a great job getting the damn thing done. Was awesome working with another person who also prefers pairing, and this project was perfect for that.

'It was hard sometimes to see you stressing about everything. I know this program is fucking difficult, but you greatly underestimate your skills a lot of the time. I recall the one moment where you were most stressed was over a new feature that had just gotten released, and it turned out even the most capable people in the class were getting just as stuck as we were. You actually were SUPER close in the hour you spent working on it, and tweaking your ideas while chatting w/ other people in class lead the solution after you left for your gig. The pieces you had were actually what others were missing, and if you just had faith in your code you would've been able to knock that feature out as well as help others after talking w/ our classmates about where you were stuck.

'However, you did a great job of dealing with your stress, and it wasn't in the least bit an issue for me as your partner. You actually stayed outwardly super positive despite everything, and didn't let it affect the team. I could just tell it was getting to you internally since I'm good at reading body language lol, but you didn't put it on me. Working with you was a breeze. You were super accommodating to my schedule at the time, and stayed in constant communication.

'You're far more capable than you think Anna. Nobody knows what the hell they're doing in this program, and you can't compare yourself to other people. You also have a life outside of this program, which is a healthy thing many others are missing. Look forward to working with you again in the future!' - Jeff Buss

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

- Recognizing black holes and working to avoid them/reflect on if it's worth your time.
- DTR
- Thinking about job scenario during coding - if you were in a job environment when would you cut bait and work on a different feature or bit off a smaller chunk?

### Outcome

PASS
