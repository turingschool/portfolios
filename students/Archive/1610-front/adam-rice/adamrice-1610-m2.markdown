# Adam Rice - Module 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I wanted to set a strong foundation regarding React.js, APIs, Accessibility, Aria, Sass, and webpack. I also strived to expand my professional network and reach out to developers that are currently working in the industry. Lastly, I wanted to set an example for the 1610 cohort by attending every class lecture and consistently being at Gusto early and leaving late.

##### Feedback

From Devin: I really liked working on the 2DoBox project with you. I think you're really good at staying calm when things break and I can tell you really like to think through a problem before you try and implement it. We had originally planned to do a lot of the work together, but we ended up working on different parts of the project and combining our efforts to get it done. I actually think this worked out really well, especially since we did have a few opportunities to work together to solve some smaller problems and bugs.

### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/weatherly)
* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

An application built using React.js, Sass, and references and API created by yung-Jhun. User can search between four locations and receive a comprehensive seven day forecast.

##### Feedback

From Anna: For the most part, I enjoyed working with Adam on our weather app. Adam has a very firm grasp of React, CSS, and Sass. A few times I was under the impression that we would be pairing on work and when we met he had already accomplished the tasks we were supposed to complete together. This made me feel like I was not contributing to the project and also not learning. When we did work together, we worked well and were productive. I think both of us can be more explicit about our preferred communication and pairing styles and ensure we both understand what we will be accomplishing together and apart. This will work to prevent one partner from being steamrolled and the other from feeling like they are doing all the work.

### Shoot the Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/Shooting-the-Breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

##### Feedback

From Andy: I learned a lot while working with Adam. He has a good sense of humor, is adept in learning new skills, and above all, he is patient and tactful.
Adam keeps clear lines of communication and inspires a drive to improve.
It is somewhat challenging to offer critique, because I feel Adam cares deeply about his, as well as other's success. He leads well, often by example. He carefully gauged my skill level and suggested areas of the project were I could be sufficiently challenged. Adam comports himself will confidence and tact in a way that feels to me as though he could (and should) lead in the near future.
As far as areas of improvement.. boy this is hard, because I don't feel like Adam is behind, or struggling in some way. I'm actually watching my cursor blink trying to think of an area were he can improve.. Hey! Here's an idea versus a critique..
Adam should conduct a student led session! Maybe on project management? I think he leads well and could share some of his insights. I'm better for the time spent working with Adam and others would be too.

### Fire-Bae (Nimble Network)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/nimbleNetwork)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

##### Feedback

From Josh Small: Fire-bae project was soooo fun to work on with Adam. Honestly, the only difficult thing about working with him was my difficulty judging whether or not he was joking about something. haha Other than that it was a breeze, he knows React back and forth and was able to pick up Native without much effort. He is always willing to help out if I get held up on something or supply comic relief if I get too stressed out about an issue. He also took the role of project manager, in this position he exceeded expectations. He regularly brought the group together to discuss what still needed to be worked on and what was a priority. I think myself and Justin benefitted from this since I have a tendency to just choose a feature and work on it until it is complete. Before this project, me and Adam hadn't spent much time together but I feel like after this project we not only produced a very successful and professional product but a new friendship.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

In this session I was exposed to many issues that I normally do not encounter personally are think about often. The readings showed me how microaggressions can build up over time and eventually create a sense of constant anger from the victim. Many members of my group discussion on this topic felt that microaggressions are a cause of the victim being overly sensitive, I disagree. I am now more thoughtful when asking a person I do not know well personal questions as innocent comments can be forms of microaggression.

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

During this session I was able to pair with a member of the 1606 FE program. I learned alot about her personal struggle during our pairing session and was able to accuretly draw this on a Journey Map. This session taught me how to ask questions that dive deeper into a persons individual experience.

#### Grit Mindset

[GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

In this session I discovered the true meaning of grit and how passion plays and important role. Before this session I thought grit was simply stubbornness. I also learned that teachers are attempting to implement grit into current grade school programs. Lastly, I learned that simply thinking about the ways a project or task may benefit me in the long run will positively influence my attitude while completing the task, versus weakening my personal grit.  


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)

In this sessin I was exposed a list of new resources I was not aware for job searching and networking including MeetUp, WeWork, and Mashable

#### Agile Practices and Project Management

During this session I was able to build my Johori Window based on my previous partners responses. I enjoyed seeing the blind spot characteristics. I am also able to review feedback and consider Right & Wrong Spotting and how this may trigger my fight or flight response. See above link for a reflection on how I have incorporated feedback from my past partners.

#### Cold OutReach

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md
)
* See below for completed deliverables

I enjoyed this session as I was able to create a cold-outreach draft email and receive feedback from my peers. I received several good suggestions including ways to connect with my email recipient via similar interests and adjusting my subject line.

Deliverables:
12/20 email - to Tim Fueling(Staffing Agent- Logical Personnel Services):
I sent an email to Tim expressing my interest in a junior developer position in the southeast he had posted on linkedin. We have corresponded through email a few times in the last week regarding a few developer positions he is aware of. Now that the holidays are over he plans to speak with me this week about a junior dev position in GA.

12/21 email - to DeeDee Deig(Technical Recruiter-Vassar Information):
I emailed DeeDee expressing my interest in a technical account manager position she had posted on linkedin. I did speak with DeeDee on the phone last week and she was planning to pass my information to the hiring company. I plan to call her tomorrow if I have not heard anything but she did mention it may take a week a two for a callback just due to the new years office closings.

12/21 email - Tom Mast(DevOps-Vodori-Chicago):
I emailed Tom as we new each other years ago. Catching up on his personal life mostly over the past couple weeks through a phone call and several text messages. Tom works for a marketing/software company that would be a great place to work.

12/26 email - to Colin McNeill (Technical Support Specialist-Profound Logic Software-CA):
I met Colin once while living in Indianapolis. I reached out to him to say hello and asking about how he was liking his new job in California. We have corresponded back and forth once since this message but I have not heard from him since before new years.

 1/8 email - to Kate Owen(iOS junior dev - Detroit Labs):
I sent an introduction to Kate asking about the culture of Detroit Labs. I also shared that I had attended the workshop put on by Erika Carlson of Detroit Labs in October 2016. I have not heard back from Kate at this time.

1/8 email - to Trent Theising(Client success manager -Old National Bank):
I emailed Trent because Old National is one of the largest employers in Evansville Indiana where my parents and sister live. I introduced myself and shared that I have worked for a financial institution before. I also asked about his favorite aspects of working at Old National. He has not responded to me just yet.

1/9 email - Brandon Carr(IT Staffing Manager-Pinnacle Partners):
I emailed Brandon because when I moved to Indianapolis four years ago another associate at his office helped me find my first job. I sent him my resume and asked about the job market for junior devs in Indianapolis. I have not heard back from Brandon just yet.

#### Networking

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)

In this session I was able to present my elevator pitch to three BE students. This was good practice for me and I enjoyed hearing their feedback as well as their own pitches. I was able to greatly improve my story regarding 'who I am', 'where I come from', and 'what is next' for future interactions in the job search.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Justin Wood: Working with Justin Wood during the final project of mod two was great. Justin is very good at problem solving independently as well as with  a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and encouraged our group to try React Native. The quality that I admire most about Justin is his ability to focus his attention fully to one issue and not get distracted until he has resolved that issue. Regarding areas of improvement Justin often will be silent while coding and could improve his interaction with partners while problem-solving. He could also benefit from utilizing branches in GitHub and closing Issues via Pull Requests. Justin led by example throughout the project by consistently working later than everyone and arriving first to the classroom in the mornings.

To Josh Small: Working with Josh Small during the final project of mod two was great. Josh is very good at problem solving independently as well as with  a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and agreed to try React Native. The quality that I admire most about Josh is his ability to create professional looking applications that have a consistent theme throughout. Regarding areas of improvement Josh seems to dislike revealing his opinion when a decision is being made. He could also benefit from utilizing branches in GitHub and closing Issues via Pull Requests. Josh’s calm demeanor and ability to contribute to every aspect of the project made him an extremely valuable team member.

To Devin: Working with Devin on 2DoBox was a good experience. Devin was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing, take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer, and she was willing to ask for help from instructors and her mentor in times of crisis. I feel that Devin could benefit by taking short breaks every 20-30 minutes when working as it seems she will power through several hours with no breaks. This made me as her partner feel pressured to not take breaks as often. Also, towards the end of the deadline I felt that Devin and myself did not do a good enough job explaining the improvements we would make on commits and the work would not be double checked before being merged. Over the course of the week-long project I was happy to learn that Devin is very patient, logical, modest about her abilities, and passionate about solving difficult problems.

To Anna: Working with Anna on Weatherly was a fun experience. Anna was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing, take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer, and she was willing to ask for help from instructors. I like that just hours before our assessment Anna was still making improvements to the application.

### Being a Community Member

From Jon Willemain: I had the opportunity to pair with Adam for my game-time project, which was the first opportunity I had to work on a project with him since last mod. I really enjoy pairing with Adam because he brings a lot of great ideas about the way I was looking to tackle a problem. Some of the other individuals I paired with try to approach the a issue I am having the way they feel comfortable with, which could be a little frustrating if you don't quite understand their thought process. If I have another issue and need someone to give me an idea for another way to look at a problem, I will be looking for Adam.

### Playing a Part

During this module I enjoyed attending several of the Turing events. My favorites included demo night and the morning sessions for cohort 1610FE where we worked on our JavaScript fundamentals as a group. I am excited to continue being a leader in our community and I hope to be elected as our cohort's SAB rep for the next module.
