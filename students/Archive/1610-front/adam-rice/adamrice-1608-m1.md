# ADAM RICE - M1 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering Program

In this module I wanted to set a strong foundation regarding the fundamentals for html, css, JavaScript, jQuery and testing. I also strived to determine the best way for me to learn the material as web development is very new to me and unlike anything that I went to school for previously. Lastly, I attempted to be a great partner during any partner projects in order to strengthen the sense of community within the 1608 cohort.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Module One projects including Number Guesser, Linked List, IdeaBox and Game-time.

#### Number Guesser

https://github.com/adam-rice/number_guess

**Specification**

* Phase One: Basic Requirements
The application should have the following user interface components:
-An input field for guessing the number
-A button for submitting a guess
-A button for clearing the input field
-A button that resets the game to its initial state
-An element that displays the users most recent guess
-An element that displays a message to user
-If their guess is too high, it should display: ‚ÄúSorry, that guess is too high. Try a lower number.‚Äù
-If their guess is too low, it should display: ‚ÄúSorry, that guess is too low. Try a higher number.‚Äù

* Phase Two: More Better
-The type attribute for the guess input should be ‚Äúnumber‚Äù.
-It should have ‚Äúmin‚Äù and a ‚Äúmax‚Äù attributes equal to the minimum and maximum of the reange of guesses (e.g. 1 and 100, respectively).
-The application should display an error message if the guess is not a number (e.g. parseInt() returns NaN).
-The application should display an error if the guess is outside of the range of possible answers.
-The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
-The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.

CSS Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### IdeaBox

https://github.com/adam-rice/IdeaBox

**Specification**
* An Idea has an id, title, a body, and a quality.
The id should be a unique identifier.
title and body are free-form strings.
quality should be one of the follow: ‚Äúgenius‚Äù, ‚Äúplausible‚Äù, and ‚Äúswill.‚Äù
By default, the idea‚Äôs ‚Äúquality‚Äù should default to the lowest setting (i.e. ‚Äúswill‚Äù).
See a list of all existing ideas, including the title, body, and quality for each idea.
Ideas should appear in descending chronological order (with the most recently created idea at the top).
See two text boxes for entering the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù and ‚ÄúBody‚Äù for a new idea, and a ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button for committing that idea.
A new idea with the provided title and body should appear in the idea list.
The text fields should be cleared and ready to accept a new idea.
The page should not reload.
The idea should be persisted. It should still be present upon reloading the page.
Each idea in the list should have a link or button to ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù (or ùó´).
Upon clicking ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù, the appropriate idea should be removed from the list.
The page should not reload when an idea is deleted.
The idea should be removed from localStorage. It should not re-appear on next page load.

Evaluation Scores and Comments: Adam Rice and Graham Nessler

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface

https://github.com/adam-rice/Lingo

**Specification**
* Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code
Separate business-logic code from view-related code
Use test-driven design to build a client-side application

Evaluator: Brenna
Student: Adam & Alex

Functional Expectations

4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Alex P: Alex and I were paired for the Gametime project. Alex is a very hard worker and great team player. He was willing to slowly breakdown any problems that he solved if I did not understand how he got to a solution. Alex does not get frustrated easily so it is easy to work with him.

Feedback for Christine G:  I worked with Christine on the Linked List project. Christine was a great partner and our final product turned out better than I expected. Christine is a hard worker and took the extra step to break down any solution if I was unclear as to how a specific function was working.

Feedback for Graham N: Graham was great to work with on IdeaBox. We spent each day over the weekend meeting and discovering solutions to the difficult problems that IdeaBox presents. Graham has strong skills in time management and problem solving.

### Being a Community Member

Alex P wrote:
Adam was a great partner and a gracious host when we were working on our GameTime project over the weekend. I am glad I was paired with him and he was so willing to plunge his effort into our crazy little word game.

Graham N wrote:
I really enjoyed working with Adam. We were paired together for Idea Box, which was the most challenging project we'd had to date, and the most challenging project of the mod aside from Game Time. Adam made a lot of excellent suggestions and did a very good job with the design. It was a pleasure and I hope to be paired with him again.

Christine G wrote:
I worked with Adam on our second project, linked-list. This was the first project I've had at Turing where we divided up almost all of the responsibilities, and I thought it was a great experience.  We were able to coordinate what we were doing and help each other as needed while each making significant progress.  Adam has a very solid understanding of Javascript and how to approach different problems. He also understood the importance of collaboration and was flexible with my schedule, making him a great partner!

Chaz G wrote:
I never had a chance to work with Adam on a project, but he was always available to help whenever having a question. I look forward to working with Adam in the future

### Playing a Part

During module one I enjoyed attending several of the Turing events. My favorites include demo night and the SAB celebration at the clock tower pavilion. I have made many new friends over the last few weeks and I am excited to become a leader in the community. Being new to the school it was challenging to find the balance between necessary work and community but I feel much more comfortable doing this now and moving forward.

------------------

## Final Review

### Notes

Feelings around fundamentals:
HTML - feels good confident
CSS - feels confident, needs to review some flexbox
JS/jQuery - was feeling a bit lost, feels like he wasn‚Äôt writing it enough on his own so wasn‚Äôt gaining the muscle memory and wasn‚Äôt having the confidence to be able to do it on his own.

As he builds confidence, we encourage him to give more constructive criticism in feedback to help his peers improve and grow.

We encourage Adam to push himself out of his comfort zone, take a more active role in projects and lead his teams. We‚Äôre very excited to see Adam push himself and grow in the coming months.

### Outcome

Will repeat mod1.
