# ADAM RICE - M1 Portfolio - 1610

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to reinforce the items that I felt comfortable with after spending 6 weeks with 1608 but also to improve the areas where I was lacking. Specifically, I needed to improve my ability to solve difficult problems when writing code and not giving up when the solution did not immediately come to me. This would involve visiting the CodeWars site on a regular basis so that I could become more comfortable with the tools that javascript offers. Also, I intended to write several small applications in the first month that were not part of a Turing project or homework assignment. In regards to CSS I was also excited to become more confident in manipulating sections of the page and truly understanding how I was doing so, in order to help my classmates when they had issues. Lastly, I wanted to become a better member of the 1610 cohort than I had been while part of 1608. This would involve being in class everyday, being available when my classmates had questions, and asking the instructors questions when I felt I was not understanding a lesson.

* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

A number guessing game created by Kenia Farias and Adam Rice using vanilla javaScript. This applicaton was the first project of the Front-End program at the Turing School of Software & Design.

#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### UX/UI Expectations
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

#### Functional Expectations
* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Feedback from Kenia: Adam thank you for taking on a mentor role and really guiding the project in the right direction. Also, thanks for letting me struggle instead of just giving me the answer right away. It really helped me to become more comfortable with writing out code. I think our project worked out really well because of our initial DTR and our constant communication. I also became a lot more comfortable pushing and pulling changes from and to gitHub. I feel like there were some parts of the project where you had a great idea and went with it, but I would have liked to go over what some of the changes were a little more in depth. I really think our overall teamwork was great and I learned a lot!

### Bookmark List

* [View on github.](https://github.com/adam-rice/Bookmark-List)

#### Collaboration
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

Feedback from Chaz: Adam and I worked together on "Idea Box" , which introduced 'localStorage' into the JS/jQuery fold. Overall the experience was ideal - we planned properly and were able to break out work into segments, allowing us both to have a 'hands-on' experience. Adam's grasp of JS exceeds my own, and there were points in the project where he blazed ahead and got a lot done in that department - however, he made sure to walk me through, and ensure that I could explain the logic/how-to, in those moments. As we move forward as a cohort, I look forward to working with Adam further.

### Game Time

* [View on github.](https://github.com/jonwille/Frogger)
* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Frogger in Javascript! This game was built by Jon Willemain and Adam Rice as a pair project in Module 1 at the Turing School.

#### Evaluator: Bree
#### Functional Expectations
* 3: Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### User Interface
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing
* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### Code Sanitation
* 4: Zero complaints. 

Feedback from Jon: Adam, it was definitely a great time building "Frogging" with you . I really appreciate you stepping up when I was sick, and for hosting me so we could work on our project over the weekend. I was worried about being behind for missing those days, but you made sure I was understood all of the code that was written. I do not have any constructive criticism for you, you definitely helped me learn a lot on a project that had a lot of moving parts. I think it is a project we can be very proud of.


## D: Professional Skills
I was able to work on my professional skills over the last six weeks and focused on adaptability and problem-solving. The projects during mod one are challenging I put my energy towards staying positive, resilient, and patient. In regards to problem-solving I took time each morning to do warm-ups and practiced writing small applications so that I could be more comfortable pairing while writing code. 

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I enjoyed discussing the reason that each member of a cummunity needs to participate in the community. When members do not contribute to the community it starts to crumble. We also talked about how many citizens in other countries envy our right to vote.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This topic surprised me and I was excited to watch the video because I am mostly introverted. I agreed with many of the elements of Susan's TED Talk and realized just how many office norms are built for extroverts. Now that Susan helped me realize just how bias the system has become I hope to find ways to improve the situation for myself and fellow introverts in the future when I start my career.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

For me this was the best gear up session of the mod. The group I was assigned was diverse which made the conversation very interesting. I learned the most from a group member who is attending Turing while also raising two kids. I felt inspired by this individual and honored to be a collegue of theirs. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### iOS Session with Erika Carlson from Detroit Labs

I learned a lot at the workshop led by Erika. We spent the first four hours reviewing basic javascript terms and practiced writing a few basic functions. Next, we began writing our first application using Swift. It was exciting to build a simple app for a mobile iOS device using xCode and Swift. Writing code in a different language actually helped me feel more comfortable writing in vanilla javascript. The second day we built three more apps that were each slightly more complex.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jon Willemain: During the Game Time project I was paired with Jon and was very excited when I learned this. Jon and I were already friends before pairing. Jon is a smart guy and willing to work hard on problems that arise. I feel that Jon could be better at talking through a problem when pairing, as often we would be looking at code trying to resolve a problem and Jon would be very silent. Also, there was a day that Jon and I were scheduled to meet and Jon failed to show up on time, did not answer my calls, then called me two hours later and claimed he had fallen asleep. Jon perhaps could have thought ahead in this situation and set an alarm.  Jon is good at staying relaxed in stressful and trying situations.

To Kenia Farias: Kenia was willing to collaborate, work hard, and also take breaks. I enjoyed working with Kenia. Kenia could be even more aggressive and take charge on a specific element, whether it be css or a challenging javascript function. Kenia is positive and does not get stressed in trying situations.

To Chaz: During IdeaBox I was excited to be paired with Chaz as we had both had already completed IdeaBox once before. Chaz is a hard worker and was not afraid to trust me and break up some of the duties as we only had three days to complete the project. Chaz is also good at explaining how he resolved an issue as he worked out many of the CSS issues and minor js bugs we were experiencing on the final day. I feel that Chaz would benefit from increasing his pace when coding and writing faster. 

### Being a Community Member

From Mike Zicarrdi: I never had a chance to work with Adam on a project, but he was always available to help whenever I had a question or just wanted to chat. I look forward to working with Adam in the future.

### Playing a Part

Over the past six weeks I strived to be a leader in the 1610 cohort and participate in Turing wide functions. I enjoyed attending the Glow at the Gardens meetup held at the Denver botanical gardens by SAB as well as some other none Turing sanctioned events put on by Turing students. Alison held a discussion for the students that completed the Strengths Finder questionnaire that I was able to attend. In order to set a good example for the 1610 cohort I would typically arrive well before 9a and be solving a CodeWars problem to warm-up. I was surprised by how many classmates came to me with questions on each project. I enjoyed giving them suggestions but not just providing the answer. Because I was builing my Frogger game on one of the large TVs in the main classroom over the last week I feel that many others making the same game saw the extra elements Jon and I were adding to the game and pushed themselves to also add these elements.
