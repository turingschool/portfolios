# ADAM RICE - M3 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering Program

In this module I wanted to have fun learning redux and react router. I also strived to expand my professional network and reach out to developers that are currently working in the industry. Lastly, I wanted to set an example for the 1610 cohort by attending every class lecture, leading retro, and consistently being at the Guaranty Bank before 9a and leaving after 5p.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

An application built using react & react-router. A user will be displayed jokes based on the number they specify. The user can also favorite jokes which are displayed on a unique favorites route. The user can also replace the Chuck Norris name in each joke and set parental controls using the Settings route. The application is responsive.

Evaluation: Brenna

Notes:

 - Missing '/jokes' path in URL

 - Designed for mobile!

Specification Adherence

3+ - The application completes all 3 iterations.

Code Quality

3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated no gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

Design

4 - Developer aligned design completely with provided comps. Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

2+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### Primed

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/Primed)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

An application where a user can search the weather forecast of any given city and customize the theme of the forecast results with gifs(A FUN, CUSTOMIZABLE WEATHER APP). Built with AngularJS 1, JavaScript, and Sass.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Film Favorites

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

An application built using redux, react, & react-router. The API used for gathering movie information comes from The Movie DB. A user can create an account or log in with an existing account, view movies that are currently playing in theaters or popular movies, and add movies from the Now Playing list to a their own Favorites list.

Evaluation: Taylor

Specification Adherence  

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.

Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


Feedback:
* From Elijah W: Adam was great to work with on Movie Tracker.  He was well organized, confident in his abilities and delivered on all aspects.  The area I would challenge him in is considering how he could be more vocal when pairing  I’ve seen Adam step up tremendously as a developer and community member over the last three mods.  I’d gladly work with him again.

* From Eric S: Adam made working on our "FilmFavs" project go much more smoothly than I expected! He is an excellent communicator and asks pertinent questions that tend to clarify details.  Adam helped motivate us to keep going when we were stuck and was instrumental in not only project planning, but also in thinking about application architecture and code organization, which I tend to neglect too often!  At times when pairing, Adam may have been hesitant to slow us down if we were going too fast, but he did well at keep us from going off on random tangents.  Adam was pleasant to work with and made easier a tough project where we didn't know how much we were going to get done at the beginning, especially since the back-end/SQL stuff was brand new to us. During the project, he and Elijah helped guide my direction and thinking and helped me analyze my thoughts and problem-solving techniques more carefully. They were both instrumental in making sure decisions were a team effort, and everyone was on the same page. I wish I could have a chance to work with Adam again! Instead, I wish Adam well at his new job; we'll all miss him in Mod4!

#### RemEmber

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/1610-remember-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

An application built using Ember and tested with Q-Unit. A user can create new reminders, edit existing reminders, and delete reminders.

Feedback:
* From Dylan A: Working with Adam is a great experience. He is by nature very managerial, and a task manager, who always keeps the workflow organized and on track. He is a quick learner and a gifted programmer. He also has great work ethic. He is maybe the best at personal preparation in our whole cohort. If I need to know how to prepare for something, Adam has a great plan I can learn from. I am really glad Adam joined our cohort and thankful to call him a friend, and I know he will do Turing proud as he jumps into his new career at Nielsen!

#### Ultimate UX Design + Build Team Challenge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/fitness-app-comp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ultimate-ux-ui-team-challenge.html)

An application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Sketch.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

In this session I was exposed to the Parable of the Polygons story and explored how small choices made by individuals can effect a large society. The story of the polygons displayed examples of how communities become segregated and I was very suprised by the data. I did not realize that by demanding your community have other members just like you, the split between races (or any kind of difference) will occur so suddenly. In my small group we discussed ways that we can be more accepting of members of our community that are different, diversity quotas, as well as how Turing can be more inclusive.

#### Automation and the future

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

In this session we watched two eye opening videos regarding how automation will drastically change our world in the very near future. I do not feel that our leaders are preparing for this shift and this change will have a very negative consequences for the majority of the world population. Humankinds ability to adapt in a way that will make life better quickly seems unrealistic to me. For a long period of time quality of life will decrease until a new norm is established and/or millions have died.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In this session we read several eye opening articles on UBI. I enjoyed discussing this subject with group of three other Turing students. One of my group members did point out that the recent comment by Elon Musk, 'UBI is inevitable', may come from first hand experience since Elon runs several manufacturing plants. I plan to reach out to my local government and request that they begin planning for a future where all jobs are automated and UBI is a possible solution.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Elijah Williams: Working with Elijah during the Movie Tracker project was great. Elijah is very good at problem solving independently as well as with a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and encouraged our group to add unique features such as the single movie card for each movie. The quality that I admire most about Elijah is his ability to focus his attention fully to one issue and not get distracted until he has resolved that issue. Regarding areas of improvement Elijah could get more familiar with testing a react & redux application. I am very glad that I got to partner with Elijah during this mod.

To Eric Sayler: Working with Eric on Movie Tracker was a fun experience. Eric was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing and take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer. I feel that Eric could benefit by taking short breaks every 20-30 minutes when working as it seems he will power through several hours with no breaks. Eric was a great team member and I am glad we were put in a group together.

To Dylan Avery: Working with Dylan during the Ember project was easy. Dylan is very good at problem solving independently as well as with a partner. He was also great at adapting to the unique requirements of the project, ie the Git workflow required for RemEmber. I do not regret asking Dylan to be my partner.

To Andrew Crist: Working with Andrew on the UX/UI project was a fun experience. Andrew worked very hard so that we could deliver a polished final product. Andrew is great at working both solo and with a team. I feel that Andrew could benefit from utilizing git branches and making more commits throughout the building stage of an application. Andrew is the kind of person who makes a project fun and professional.

### Being a Community Member

From Jon Willemain: I had the opportunity to pair with Adam for my game-time project, which was the first opportunity I had to work on a project with him since last mod. I really enjoy pairing with Adam because he brings a lot of great ideas about the way I was looking to tackle a problem. Some of the other individuals I paired with try to approach the a issue I am having the way they feel comfortable with, which could be a little frustrating if you don't quite understand their thought process. If I have another issue and need someone to give me an idea for another way to look at a problem, I will be looking for Adam.

### Playing a Part

During this module I enjoyed representing my cohort as a SAB representative. Leading each Friday retro was fun. I also liked meeting new students from other cohorts at the Friday Spikes and Gear Ups.
