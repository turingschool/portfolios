# Dylan Avery - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For M3, my main goals were to assess better and with less anxiety, and to always go above and beyond my own expectations when writing a test suite. Also, I really wanted to get more comfortable with basic dev-ops things like hosting a website and updating it with a github repo. Lastly, I wanted to get better at using callbacks, like in the setting of state for instance.

[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

For this project I built a CRUD app using an Express backend to handle OAuth2, and to return an access token to the user so as to make API calls from the front end. It started out as a Genius.com thing, then I tried to play with other APIs that use OAuth2. I made a nice Oauth2 boilerplate that can be used interchangably with other similar APIs. Eventually I settled on a Vimeo search/favorite app. In the end I learned that I want to think about the product first in the future, set my aim real high, and then find the tools to make it happen be it external API or rest API.

* [https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

For this project we built a basic CRUD app making API calls to the movie database.

##### Evaluation Comments

Notes: Great job refactoring and getting the app into a working state over the last couple days of the project. Demonstrated a much clearer understanding of React/Redux architecture, and was able to solve bugs previously reported. Routing issues were resolved and worked splendidly. Testing should be slightly less linked to the HTML/DOM Content, but solid effort put in across the board there.

##### Evaluation Scores

Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

##### Feedback from Chelle Tuerk

Working with Dylan on the React Redux project was an experience I will always look back on fondly.  He truly is a secret genius that is rarely acknowledged.  His mind is like a machine that's built for coding.  We struggled though a few unfamiliar parts of the project, but always got back on track, primarily through Dylan's efforts.  I have zero recommendations for improvement.  He takes programming very seriously and will be an amazing asset to any team.

##### Feedback from Lauren Pesce

Dylan was an incredible team member for our Redux project, as well as leading the Verou posse together. He is able to problem solve efficiently and has a great understanding of the code. He was patient and was always willing to take extra time to help me if I wasn’t understanding something. He’s positive and fun to work with, even when things were broken and complicated. He was dedicated to creating the best code possible, and worked hard to make sure our project was the best it could be. While leading Verou, Dylan is helpful and makes our spike sessions enjoyable. Dylan is one of my favorite people to work with and has become a great friend, he’s truly an excellent developer and person.

##### Feedback from Adam Rice

 Working with Dylan during the Ember project was easy. Dylan is very good at problem solving independently as well as with a partner. He was also great at adapting to the unique requirements of the project, ie the Git workflow required for RemEmber. I do not regret asking Dylan to be my partner.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown](Tragedy of the Commons)

This was a somewhat hard Gear Up for me to follow, because of the animations. It did make sense to me though that a diversity quota would help build the momentum needed to achieve true diversity. We ended up talking a lot about how a little forced diversity at Turing could lead to real diversity down the line, because people need to see themselves represented, and they need role models they can relate to, and unless you have ever been a minority in a situation like that, you cannot really fathom how much that can weigh into your success.

### Gear Up
#### Automation

  * [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown](Automation)

  Our talk on automation was mainly centered around how it would effect jobs in the future of our society. We decided that automation is inevitable, and that even jobs like artist or web developer will be automated eventually. I was of the state of mind that we should as developers, spend time and effort on figuring out what to do when jobs become automated. It was funny because I kept steering our group and our class towards a talk about UBI, and then Beth said at the end of the Gear Up that our next Gear Up would be on UBI. This made sense to me, because UBI is something that you could spend a whole 4 years studying at University and still not have any answers.

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown](Grit)

  This was a Gear Up where I basically just avoided confrontation. I had written down some notes about how it wouldn't matter if people were lazy because if society is automated there is no need to "contribute to society". When I sat down with my group though, I quickly realized the two guys I was paired with were very anti-UBI. They thought it would make people lazy, and they thought it was a kind of welfare. I did mention that they were thinking within the restrictions of a modern economy, but UBI would take place in a post-modern, post-automation economy.

  I thought about it later, and decided that there are two types of laziness. There is the laziness where dishes pile up in the sink, and there is the laziness where we invented the dishwasher.

  Automation doesn't make us lazy because of UBI. We need UBI because we made automation, because we lazy. We lazy.

### Giving Feedback

#### To Chelle Tuerk on Groovy Moovyz

"Working with Chelle Tuerk is truly a joy. I enjoy it so much that I pair with her all the time now even though we are no longer working on a specific project together. Her unbounded energy is exciting, and makes me feel like I am in the show Silicon Valley. Chelle has all the personality traits of someone who makes a big impact on the world. I think think the sky is the limit for Chelle, and that she can continue to be on the cutting edge of programming for decades to come, because of her tenacity and her drive and her competitive spirit. She is a brilliant person and our cohort would be sorely lacking wihout her. In fact I would say that any good team needs a Chelle on it, but a Chelle is rare. My only advice for Chelle would be to maybe keep her notebook and pen handy, so she can write down a direction before she steps foot on the path, to make sure it makes sense theoretically before trying to put it into practice."

#### To Lauren Pesce on Groovy Moovyz

"Working with Lauren Pesce is a great experience. She is a dedicated programmer, who will engage a problem with 100% of her focus, and stick with it until it is solved. Lauren has a knack for looking at a whole range of possible solutions, and moving effortlessly from one to the other if it is what is required. She is a leader at Turing, both in our classroom, and in an official capacity as one of the co-leads of Verou Posse. At Verou Posse spikes she has done an incredible job engaging new students, and building relationships across cohorts both front-end and back-end. She is also a very good public speaker, as well as often the first person to speak up with an idea during a brainstorm. If I had any advice to Lauren it would probably be to continue to make time and space for the things that make you healthy and happy, and not to spend too much time fighting with a bug, if she needs to instead take a breather."

#### To Adam Rice on remEmber

"Working with Adam is a great experience. He is by nature very managerial, and a task manager, who always keeps the workflow organized and on track. He is a quick learner and a gifter programmer, and he has great work ethic. He is also maybe the best at personal preparation in our whole cohort. If i need to know how to prepare for something, Adam has a great plan I can learn from. I am really glad Adam joined our cohort and thankful to call him a friend, and I know he will do Turing proud as he jumps into his new career!"

#### To Maia Stone on UX/UI Challenge

"Working with Maia was a great experience. She is a great communicator, and very easy-going. She has a great over-standing of CSS, and is good at envisioning something as it gets manifested on screen. She has laser like, rapid-fire focus, and avoids wasting any time. She is also great at brainstorming, and she is a well-spring of ideas. Maia has been a role model and mentor during my time here at Turing, and I thank her for helping us be better hustlers and programmers.  "

#### To Lucy Conklin on Verou Posse

"Working with Lucy Conklin has been a wonderful experience. Her personal website has been an inspiration to me since Mod1. I think she was probably the first back-end student I met since she has been so prevalent in the Verou Posse from the start. As a co-lead of the posse, she has been instrumental, as she is great at planning activities, and communicating with a large group of tired students on a late Friday afternoon. I also love her illustrations, they remind me of how much I used to like looking at pictures of animals in their underground homes as a kid, and how the holes were all interconnected. I look forward to working more with Lucy on Verou Posse stuff in Mod 4!"

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Maia Stone

I had a great time working with Dylan for our design comp challenge.  Even though we'd never worked together, it was a smooth and easy process.  He's clear in his communication, has solid user experience design ideas, and is great with Sketch.  We worked really well pairing together, sharing ideas and implementation. If I had one suggestion, it would fall under time management, and to have worked on the final touches earlier. Overall, I really like his laid back but professional attitude and would work with him anytime.


### Playing a Part

During this mod I took over leadership of Verou Posse along with Lucy Conklin and Lauren Pesce. Early on we recruited new members during wrap up. We also organized various spikes which all went very well. I also gave a lightning talk on how to link up gitHub to a hosting site like goDaddy if you have a domain name purchased. I want to give a better version of this talk in M4, to more people.

Also, I volunteered for a Try Turing event, and spent all day helping prospective students with their code problems. I also attended Meditation a few times, and spent many weekend at Turing.

Lastly, I always try to pop into 1611 classroom and ask them if they need help with React and things like that.
