# Dylan Avery - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For M2, my main goal was to learn how to build things with React.  I also wanted to become more comfortable with testing, and to develop more of a passion for testing. I also came into this mod wanting to become a better designer. Also, I really wanted a better personal website.

Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
JavaScript Style

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
Workflow

work on increasing your speed - but your eval coding style is 'slow but steady' - so work on your speed with the tools to offset that. Shouldn't be fighting window management, random eslint pop ups, coming into an eval without your windows where they need to be

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

Collaboration

3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

##### Feedback from Justin Wood

First off, I really hope I get to work on more projects with Dylan. He has all the usual traits of a great developer. Smart, hard working, communicative, great attitude, etc. But what sets him apart from others is his ability to bring humor and positive energy to the group. No conflicts. No issues. Working with Dylan is just fun and enjoyable while very productive and professional.

##### Feedback from Eric Sayler

Working with Dylan was a ‘breeze’(!) We decided early on to pair often and were really effective as a team in catching eachother’s mistakes and using equal participation in driving and conducting during pairing. Really enjoyed working with Dylan, he’s witty, smart, and  light-hearted in the face of challenges and making mistakes, which is perfect when pairing. Dylan did a great job with Sass styling as well, which I’m less comfortable with, so I learned a lot about that too! By pairing as much as possible, we stayed motivated and were very productive in producing a great end product and given the chance I look forward to working with Dylan again in the future!

##### Evaluation Comments

tests were mad lit
loved the attention to accessibility
would like to see some of the components refactored
loved the helper function.

##### Evaluation Scores

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.

Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. The testing in this project shows that the students dedicated themselves to overcoming obstacles and figure out how to test parts of the application that were otherwise “hard to test.”

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints

##### Feedback from Stephenie Andrews

Dylan was an excellent partner.  We have a lot in common and that made our pairing fun and productive!  As a team-member, he was hard-working, patient, flexible, communicative, and had a great sense of humor.  Additionally, he was consistently cheerful and willing and able to help struggling team members.  He also had a great sense for when to work and when the team needed a break(on dogs, our 90’s rap breaks were so phat and so fly!!).  As a developer, he has a polished javascript/react style, a natural affinity for architecture and object-oriented programming and excellent work flow.  My technical skills/workflow have improved by watching and working with him.  On future projects, if might be helpful for Dylan to actively recognize his strengths and take more of a leadership role, although I think that will come naturally if it's appropriate for the group dynamics.  The meditation is neither good or bad, nor here or there, it just is, you dig? Lol!  -Stephanie Andrews

##### Feedback from Rebekah Lundy

I worked on the Budget App with Dylan. Dylan was an incredibly hard worker, a leader, and fun to be around.

Dylan was super easy to talk to. I felt very comfortable around him, whether it was asking code questions, or just goofing around. I think it was really important to have some stress relief during this project, and we were definitely able to have fun.

Dylan worked hard to make sure that everyone understood the code, and that we would finish the project in time. I think that our group was extremely successful, despite it being our first three person project. Dylan was crucial for our group. I really enjoyed with working such an awesome person. I am so glad we got to know each other better!

The project we worked on together turned out great, and I believe we all learned a lot.  This was definitely one of my favorites! Thank you so much for being such an awesome partner!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown](Microagressions)

  I think the Microagression Gear Up is definitely important. Its hard to know how much it effects someone
  to feel like they don't belong somewhere or aren't the "stereotypical programmer", when your Profile
  fits in with the "majority". Not having this default support system of "fitting in" cab be incredibly unsettling and demotivating, and there definitely needs to be efforts taken at Turing to always make this place a little more comfortable for someone who may not exactly be a "stereotypical programmer". My only issue with the Gear Up was the part about inquiring into someones heritage. I understand that we are "all Americans", and that a lot of people don't feel much connection to the place that their parents or grandparents immigrated from. But me personally, am always fascinated in that type of thing, and have a hard time not talking to people about their heritage. It seems to me its the type of thing where a few bad apples spoiled the whole bunch, because they were too ignorant to properly have a discussion about respective cultures.

### Gear Up
#### Journey Mapping

  * [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown](Journey Mapping)

    I thought that the part of Journey Mapping that resonated the most with me was using Empathy to
    craft a better user experience. We talked about getting a Drivers License, and I talked about how my Drivers License has a picture of me smiling , because I scowled at first, but the lady taking the picture said "nah uh, give me a smile", and it was really motivating so I did. I think she had a good grasp of how most people would come to her at a "pain point" in the DMV process, but it was her job to use that empathetic information positively, "hey I know you are frustrated, but let me see that beautiful smile!"

### Gear Up
#### Grit Mindset

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown](Grit)

  I went into the Grit Gear Up thinking that I basically could do without some of the advice, because just solving any coding problem gets me inspired, and I didn't really want to think about my hobbies and my passions coming into play when I need motivation. But honestly, by the end of the Budget App project, I could start to see how a side project that was more tailored to my interests and passions might be a good idea to help push me further heading into Mod 3. I also think though that the more I get comfortable with APIs, the more I will be able to accomplish this, like for instance making a side project using the Genius.com API.

#### Project Management Strategies

During this mod I had one group where we screenHeroed a lot, one group that didn't really pair at all, and one group that stayed late pairing together in person. I think all three of these strategies kind of fit its own situation. But with three people, and a lot of remote work, it might be better to have a better overview and a more organized waffle board in the future.

I think if there is a day that I don't feel humbled I probably just had a blindspot to how I was being self-absorbed or foolish. I've been trying to incorporate feedback to not just think of my own path, but to think about the journey of 1610FE as a whole and how I fit into it. And I really think that moving back into the building with cohorts who are our senior will help me get ahead and stay ahead, as opposed to getting ahead and feeling uncomfortable about keeping the pace.

### Cold Emails

#### To Matthew Clark

Hi Matt,

I am a junior web developer and rap scholar currently living in Denver.

It seems like forever ago, but I can remember riding the bus in 8th grade with a backpack full of lyrics to Enter the 36 Chambers that I had printed off OHHLA.  

I would really love to know more about what goes on in the offices of Genius.com. I'm specifically interested in how the general framework is built and maintained, and what kind of process went into wire framing and coming up with such a great platform for lyric submission in the first place.

Could we meet up in a Google Hangout, or something to that effect, maybe sometime around 5-6PM (est) on Tuesday the 10th?

Thank You,

Dylan Avery

#### To Lauren Krabbe

Hi Lauren,

I am a student at Turing and have had the pleasure of taking a few classes with you.

I would like to see what goes on at Effective UI, I am specifically interested in how you conduct research into User Experience with new clients.

Would you be able to grab coffee at The Market next Monday, maybe around Noon?

Thank You,

Dylan Avery

#### To Matthew Gravatt

Hi Matt,

I am a junior web developer currently attending school at the Turing School in Denver. I was recently admiring the OskarBlues website, and after digging a little deeper found out about Radiant Interactive.

I really love the work that Radiant Interactive does, and I would like to see what a day in the life of a Radiant Interactive developer is like.

Would you be able to grab coffee in Boulder during one of these upcoming weekends?

Thank You,

Dylan Avery

#### To Chris Downard

Hey Chris, on Friday I am going to be defending my portfolio at Turing, and am otherwise going to have a lot of free time before I go on break. Do you think I could schedule some time for me to come down to Granicus on Friday?

Thank You,

Dylan Avery

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Justin Wood on 2DoBoxPivot

Justin is one of my favorite people, and I am really glad he found his way up from Houston to our city of Denver. When talking about the way things work, or should work, Justin’s eyes light up, and he becomes this really happy person and its really a great feeling to work with someone like that. I know Justin doesn’t really love his amenities here in Denver, but its still really impressive to see him be the last person to go home every night. There are times where Justin has been rumored to have been in LoDo until 3AM, still learning. Because of this, Justin is able to make large amounts of progress in a very short amount of time. I don’t doubt that he could probably learn a new language on his own while still attending Turing. And thank you for bringing so many cool Board Games to school, and for patiently explaining the rules to all of us.

#### To Eric Sayler on Shoot The Breeze

Working with Eric is a lot of fun. He is full of joy and extra knowledge. He is very easy going and has a good command of time and energy. I think it can also be said that having a Computer Science degree has made Eric an invaluable resource to all of us. We can be a little bit more Mark Zuckerberg because of what we learn from Eric. He is definitely going to end up being a prolific programmer, with his penchant for seeing the bigger picture, and his passion for learning and reading docs. He only wishes that all his classmates had that same passion to read Documentation as he does, so maybe he should lead a spike or a group in Mod 3 where we do some reading of docs.

#### To Stephenie Andrews on Excellent Budgeting

I am so glad I got to work with Stephenie this mod. She is such a relaxing prescence, and we really have a lot in common I think, so it was easy for us to take Salt n Pepa video breaks for our Pomedoros, and to just get work done in general. She wrote a remarkable test suite that I will be using for a reference for most of MOD3 probably, and she understand Mocking and Stubbing probably better than anyone in our class. My only advice to Stephenie would be to try and twist arms more when doing group work, and if she has an idea to bring everybody with her and make them do some of the work with her. But I think this will be something Stephenie gets better at the more she figures out how to find the words to describe what she means when writing code. And let me know where the good meditation is at around here!

#### To Bekah Lundy on Excellent Budgeting

Bekah is one of my favorite people, and I am really glad she found her way to Denver to attend Turing.  Bekah is one of the best listeners in our class, and she does a great job of making everybody feel like they belong here at Turing. I was really impressed at how quickly Bekah started working in Sketch after coming into Turing with a lot of Illustrator experience. A lot of times I think it is hard for us to not use our favorite software, but she didn’t even hesitate to make the switch after Lauren recommended we try it. She is a very gifted and passionate designer and developer and I look forward to working with her more in the future.

#### To Andy Young on Weatherly

“It was a pleasure to work with Andy this mod. Andy has a great, upbeat attitude, and is a great communicator when pairing. He is also great at brainstorming, and has a knack for coming up with a cornucopia of ideas at the drop of a dime. It was also really great to screenHero with him, and it was my first screenHero experience too! My advice to Andy would be this. It seems like you would rather use some online learning tools over a lecture from Meeka or Jhun sometimes. I am sure a lot of it has to do with your schedule, and that is understandable. But if it just comes down to whether or not to watch at $20 video on React, or to attend a Turing lecture that you have probably paid a lot more for, I think you should logically try to attend the lecture instead. I think the gear-up on Grit probably made a lot of sense to you, because finding a passion project, and getting better at React doing something fun and by yourself would probably be a great way to get a better understanding of it. Much love man, thanks for all the donuts!”

#### To Michael Fenwick

“Working with Michael was a very cool experience. I realized right away that he was a gifted programmer, when he showed me some of the things he had already built prior to Turing. He was real humble about it, but I could tell he had a knack for coding when I first worked with him. When pairing with Michael it felt very fulfilling because I would give him less than a sentence of advice and he would run with it instantly and quickly solve his problem. He also is very enthusiastic and you can tell he really does enjoy working with code. I look forward to seeing Michael become a leader and top programmer here at Turing!”

#### To Michael Flynn

“I really enjoyed pairing with Michael during this module. Its great to see the NBA ranking he puts together every week. He is probably the only person who spends more time on the Reddits of /r/NBA and /r/hiphopheads than me at Turing. I hope he gets to see Just Nurkic grabbing lunch at the Crepes place soon! Believe in yourself Michael, anybody can became a great programmer at this school if they want it bad enough, and make it their top priority. I look forward to working with you more next module!” - Dylan Avery

#### To Kristen Burgess

“Kristen is such a helpful person to have at Turing, and i’m so glad for her. She reached out to me after she saw a tweet that I wrote while in distress. She recommended React Router 4 and helped me to install it and get it up and running. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without her! She is great at telling her “Turing Story” and it really helps me to put things in perspective as well. I look forward to pairing more with Kristen in the future!” - Dylan Avery

#### To Jon Willeman

“I really miss having Jon in our cohort, but its been great to see him become one of the top programmers in the building this last six weeks. He has really developed a lot of confidence and become a model Turing student since I first met him. I think he will surprise himself and be one of the top leaders at the school before too long. Look forward to pairing with you a lot more Jon, and thank you for always coming to me for advice!!! Let’s both make lots of friends this year.” - Dylan Avery



### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Krystin Villenueve

You came to pairing sessions ready to work, including early - which I really appreciate, not everyone likes to come in early! You never told me the answers, you always asked questions to guide me to figure out the next steps. Coming from that teaching perspective is an excellent strategy for helping others, always do that!!

#### Feedback from Michael Fenwick

While pairing with Dylan during linkedList, I found him to be patient and extremely helpful. When stuck on a bug Dylan was willing to research and help us address the problem.
Dylan was also the first person who showed me that I could console.log “this” and also pass “this” into other functions. This is something that has been extremely helpful when moving forward in module 1.
I would be happy to pair with Dylan again moving forward into other modules

#### Feedback from Jon Willeman

Devin and I had the opportunity to pair with Dylan and Adam for our game-time project. Dylan, like Adam, is very good at what he does. He offers a unique way at approaching a problem, without trying to take your code over, and he makes sure you understand what he is thinking. I wish we had a better idea of how we wanted to go about approaching our win function to better utilize his strengths. I hope we have another opportunity to pair in the future.

#### Feedback from Michael Flynn

Dylan has done an awesome job on pairing with me in this mod so far. your communication skills are excellent, you are easy to get along with and you have an infectious positive attitude.

### Playing a Part

During Mod 2 I continued to attend all of the spike sessions and lunches held by my posse, The Verou Posse.

I signed up to be a TA for one of the Try Turing events, and spent the afternoon paring with potential new students. I also sat on a panel for this event with other Turing students and answered questions about my Turing experience from the audience.

I made it a point to participate in the morning JavaScript warm ups held by Mike Limberg when not busy pairing with students.

I maintained an 8AM pairing slot which was filled pretty much all Mod, and paired with a wide variety of Mod 1 students during this time. Also I attended all Guest Speakers on Fridays.

I've attended most of the meditation sessions held by Adam Caron in the Blakement.

I wanted to do Improv every week too, like I did in Mod1, but it seems like Jessica and Chris have kind of stopped doing regular Improv, hopefully that will be a thing again in the future.
