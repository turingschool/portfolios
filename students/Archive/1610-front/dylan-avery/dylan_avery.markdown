# Dylan Avery - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For M1, my main goal was to strengthen my understanding of how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript work together, and how to build applications by combining all three together. I also was really focused on becoming a good team member, a good pair, and an active member of the community. A third goal of mine for this Mod was to drastically improve my LinkedIn profile and my Resume, and to think about "my story" and how to start telling it better. Also, within a week of starting M1 I
realized that I had to really start thinking more like a "designer" too, and so
I've been trying to get better at paying attention to color, typeography, and examples of good design and good UX in my everyday life experience.

##### Feedback from Joshua Small

'Dylan and I ended up working together on the Game Time project. Definitely the hardest project for me to date and I’m glad it was him I worked with for the last two weeks. We had fantastic communication from day 1 and I think that plus a solid understanding of JS and canvas is part of the reason were were able to crank out most of our functionality in week 1. Where he really came through for me though is when we started getting caught up in trying to separate out our logic. A very frustrating time for both of us but he was always willing to offer up encouraging comments to keep up the morale of the team.

I would say productivity is also one of his strong suits. It seemed every time we would stop working together at school, I would log back in to my computer when I got home to find a message that he had just figured out whatever problem we had been working on. Overall a terrific partner. I would be more than happy to work with him again.'

* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this project, we built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

##### Evaluation Comments

No extensions, but base functionality was all there

JavaScript needs some refactoring into smaller functions, there were some large if/else statements that were getting difficult to follow

Could use some more conversation in PRs, but commits were atomic and looked good

HTML was very clean, but CSS needed some details worked out in order to match the comp, width of buttons and alignment of the input fields was a little off, especially as you expand - could use a max width media query to limit the width of the app

##### Evaluation Scores

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Collaboration

3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

##### Feedback from Sam Johnson

'Hey Dylan, I really enjoyed working with you - I consider you to be one of the better developers in our cohort and it was nice to have the chance to partner.  I was impressed by your positive attitude and desire to dig in and get shit done.  I also think we did a great job of splitting off and getting big chunks of the work done efficiently and effectively and was pumped it all came together so seamlessly.  I felt like we worked well as a team and it was fun to dig into our final technical challenges together and celebrate the win when we figured it out!  I would partner with you again in a second.  

Some constructive feedback I have for you is to make sure you are taking sometime after finishing up some work/coding (or throughout) to check for mistakes and/or ensure things look clean.  I noticed a few instances where your code wasn’t lined up correctly and some places where the CSS could have been a bit more lined up with the comps. Nothing major at all but think a bit more attention to detail could really push you forward as a really solid dude in our cohort.

Cheers! -Sam'

For this project we built a small application to store a list of weblinks.

##### Evaluation Comments

Event bubbling selections should be more specific instead of querying on the document, something like querying a smaller container.

A couple of long JavaScript functions that could use some refactoring and breaking down into smaller functions
Workflow was good, but needed more conversation in the pull requests.

HTML and CSS was good, need to use unique IDs more for JavaScript hooks, and then reuse classes for similar CSS styles

##### Evaluation Scores

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML Style

##### Feedback from Mike Limberg

'Overall awesome working with you! Appreciated the hard work to get things working and your willingness to stay late and get things done with a tight timeline. Your javascript abilities helped get us going out of the gates when I had little idea on where to start.

constructive criticism I have would be to work on how you explain things to others. Maybe explain it to the rubber duck to practice? A lot of stuff you did made clear sense to you but was harder for me to understand, and being able to clearly explain it all to your partner(s) will only help you learn faster.

Also try to stay on track with the group goal when you’re tempted to go down a rabbit hole on something you just want to figure out at that moment. I’m 100% guilty of this all the time and there were times when both of us wanted to deviate a certain way, so figured I’d call it out.

Again awesome job man! Excited to see the refactor and hope to work with you again on projects in future mods.'

For this project we built a game that had a user guess a random number between 1-100.

##### Evaluation Comments

JavaScript functions could use some refactoring and dividing into smaller components.

Multiple query selectors that were repeated and not assigned to variables to reuse.

Attention to detail needed to match comp, some styling was a little off.

##### Evaluation Scores

UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Feedback from Jeff Buss

- Excellent grasp of Javascript from the start.
- Logical thinker.
- Great at seeing the end result and working towards it, but w/ sub-par planning.
- Sloppy workflow and code structure.
- Very quick to bounce back from somewhat frequent discouragement.

I couldn't ask for a better first partner. Dylan and I were a great team, and synergized very well together. Despite our inexperience, we both managed to hold our own and put together a functional product combining my previous knowledge of CSS/HTML w/ his knowledge of Javascript.

Dylan has a knack for looking at the end result, and then working backwards towards it. Despite frequent hang-ups, he is able to keep his cool. A positive attitude is extremely important in group work, and Dylan was at worst annoyed. Some might see his short bouts of negativity as an issue. I'd much prefer someone just get it out of their system quickly as he does though. A quick outburst of frustration was all that was needed before resuming the task at hand. He is great at establishing a goal, and then working quickly to reach it despite the hurdles involved.

This drive to get things done can lead to less-than-pretty results though. Often his code was visually/structurally a mess, but still worked. His workflow at the time was also sub-par and disorganized; using the mouse too much, keeping 100 tabs open, and not utilizing shortcuts. There was also a lack of planning going into the project, which would've helped us avoid some issues we ran into down the road.

I had an awesome time working w/ Dylan, and would happily do so again if he promises never to reload a page again by clicking on the button in chrome :slightly_smiling_face: Free Gucci.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown](Vote Your Conscience)

  Our discussion was refreshingly full of disagreement. Our first speaker stressed the importance of voting, our second speaker however felt the opposite way, and voiced his apathy with voting. Our third and fourth speakers spoke about using a guide to decide how to vote, which I thought also had a lot of merit. What I took away from all this is that "whether or not voting matters" is something dualistic, that effects everybody these days. They want to believe in voting, but sometimes its hard.We ran out of time before I got a chance to talk, but I basically just wanted to tell everyone how much I enjoyed their input, and that in the future I might start using a guide to vote like we had discussed.  I for one, am a big fan of Barack Obama, as a statesman and an orator, and I was also going to talk about how I think he brings a level of intellectualism to the White House that is missing, traditionally.

### Gear Up
#### Introversion

  * [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown](Introversion)

    This was an almost eerily serendipitous discussion to walk into on Friday afternoon. At lunch, my group had started talking about a guy who had left Turing because he had trouble with all the community and social stuff. He was not really a people person they said, and then they started  to talk about whether or not Turing is too hard on introverts. I for one, said that the "culture" of Turing is well spelled out for us, and that I specifically wanted to come to Turing because of the social aspect, the focus on teamwork, and the community element. Then, after the TED talk video finished, I liked at our rubric and was kind of awe struck that the questions were basically dealing with this exact discussion we had. In a way, during our Gear Up discussion, I felt a little abrasive, as I defended extroversion as a principle, and lashed out somewhat against introversion. But for me, being introverted is something that has caused me a lot of trouble in the past. So when I seek out experiences like team building or joining a community, its kind of my way of "overcoming introversion". For me, everything is about balance, the "yin and the yang". So I know that I like to work at home sometimes, and even need to sometimes. But I don't want to use that as an excuse to lower my attendance and participation, and what I said in our discussion is that I hope Turing sticks with their culture, and continues to encourage social interaction.

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown](Resilience)


    This Gear Up was about "resilience". During this gear up I learned about the concept of
    an "Internal Locus of Control." I resonated with the idea of strengthening this Locus
    by tackling obstacles. When I ride my bike I always think about "loving hills", in the
    same way the article talked about "loving snow". I have not always been where I want to be so I have learned to exercise patience and be resilient. A few tools I've picked up are to not compare your resilience to others, to think about systems instead of goals, and to be a restorative person. There is after all, always some maintenance to be done when it seems as if progress has been halted.

    My favorite quote from the article was this one.

    "Frame adversity as a challenge, and you become more flexible and able to deal with it, move on, learn from it, and grow. Focus on it, frame it as a threat, and a potentially traumatic event becomes an enduring problem; you become more inflexible, and more likely to be negatively affected."

Lia talked to us about how to stand out and set ourselves apart. To do this we were told to tell a consistent story about ourselves. After this I went home and made a map on my wall with a headline "My Story", so that I could really start to focus on the big picture of my story.

Also we were told to set your location on LinkedIn not to where you are but to where you want to work.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Jeff Buss on Number Guesser

Hey Jeff, working with you was very good. It really couldn’t have gone more easily. It was definitely helpful to have someone whose brain was firing off when mine was not. The late night work session would have been a lot more painful without you to help me get over the walls that I would hit. You definitely have a gift for algorithmic thinking and tackling problems, and you aren’t happy until you have solved them. I was really impressed with how quickly you took to CSS, Im sure it would have been impossible for me to figure most of that stuff out on my own. You also did a great job of focusing on your own feature whilst letting me focus on mine.

Some constructive criticism I would have is to make sure to overly communicate if anything, so that there isn’t any confusion amongst partners. This was obviously especially important for us since we were not really using gitHub properly that first week. Also make sure to always run a bunch of tests on the final product before Evals to make sure that no weird bugs pop up at the last second.

#### To Mike Limberg on Linked List

Hey Mike, working with you was definitely a pleasure. It really couldn’t have gone more easily. It was definitely helpful to have someone whose brain was firing off when mine was not. The late night work session would have been a lot more painful without you to help me get over the walls that I would hit. You definitely have a gift for algorithmic thinking and tackling problems, and you aren’t happy until you have solved them.

Some constructive criticism would be for us to have better gitHub convos and to do pull requests properly. Im pretty sure we have both made leaps and bounds in this area since then.

#### To Sam Johnson on Idea Box

Hey Sam, working with you was a great experience, and I probably experienced the most growth pairing with you! I was really impressed with your ability to figure things out with no delay. I was also really impressed with how well our project came together, we did a good job of splitting up the work and merging it all to one final project, and your ability to write code collaboratively made all the difference. It was also fun to share your passion for problem solving, and celebrate with you when we overcame an obstacle. You also did a great job of walking me through some of the localStorage stuff you did that I hadn’t quite grasped.


Some constructive criticism I would have is to try and be as inclusive as possible when choosing a specific route to go down. I think that if you know you are right it might be more difficult for you to explain Why you are right, instead of just saying “trust me.” At the end of the day though if I got frustrated it was also great for me to check my emotions as far as letting go of control and redoing work.

#### To Joshua Small on Frogger

Working with Josh on Frogger was a really great time. We had a lot of fun and it really didn’t even feel like work most of the time.

Josh is a very focused person who is smart and who gets stuff done. I definitely think his ability to write functions and understand JavaScript is at the top of the class. I never felt like I had to look extra hard for a Bug because Josh was at least equally as skilled when it came to scanning our code and pointing out typos, contextual errors, and anything else that needed refactoring.

Josh also did a great job of staying the course. There were a lot of times where I was just improvising and throwing ideas out there and Josh was always quick to dismiss the ideas that didn’t make sense or that didn’t fit into our theme. I know when Robbie decried our 8Bit art it was hard for Josh to bite his tongue and not yell out “original frogger is our theme!”.

Josh is definitely a great communicator, who can take a leadership role just as easily as he can follow someone else lead. You will never hear Josh complain about anything.



#### To Chelle Tuerk

Chelle is one of the most artistically gifted students in our cohort. She has a great eye for design, and had one of the best early iterations of a personal website. She is truly a joy to be around and has an infectious personality which can uplift the entire cohort at times.


### Being a Community Member

"Dylan has a serious talent for understanding complicated code that most are unable to wrap their head around.  He experiments with ideas that are seemingly impossible, yet somehow finds a way to make them fully functional.  He’s a great asset to have in class and is approachable and patient when asked questions".  

-Chelle Tuerk

### Playing a Part

At the start of Mod1 I joined the Verou posse and attended most of their spike sessions and lunches. I engaged in discussion about typography, and other subjects covered in Verou. I also participated in the SVG tutorial that Chelsea and Lacey provided, which was very helpful and useful.

I've also attended all of the Improv sessions with Chris and Jessica (although Jessica hasn't actually been there this Mod).

On Thursdays i've attended 1 of 3 meditation sessions offered by Adam, and hope to make time on Thursday mornings to attend them regularly as well.

While at Turing so far i've made it a point to attend all of the Friday morning guest talks. I've also paired with a couple students to help them compose music using the Ableton software, and have reached out over Slack to offer this to fellow students.

On Fridays, i've been an active and engaging participant in all of the lunch roulette sessions. I also enjoyed these very much, as it was the best opportunity to meet people outside of my Module, and to explore the 16th st. area with them allowed me to discover some new things about he neighborhood.

Also, I started a slack channel for students who want to go to Nuggets games.
