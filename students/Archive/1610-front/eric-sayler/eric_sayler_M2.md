##### Feedback from Bekah

I worked on the 2DoBox Pivot with Eric. Eric is a really hard worker, great at
explaining things, and honest and open.

Eric and I both made a lot of promises during our DTR. We certainly had a lot
of good intentions, but we both ended up doing poorly keeping up with those
promises. I think we dealt with this mistake well, we both realized when we
weren’t holding up our end, and confronted it head on. I believe that this made
us an awesome team.

Eric and were proud of our finished project. We had great communication
together and accomplished our goals. Eric is very knowledgeable, and made sure
I understood things when I needed help. We could be extremely honest with each
other, which I believe is a very important quality for a project partner and a
student here at Turing.

The project we worked on together turned out great, and I believe we both
learned a lot.  Thank you so much for being such an awesome partner!

###### Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

##### Feedback from Dylan

Working with Eric is a lot of fun. He is full of joy and extra knowledge. He is
very easy going and has a good command of time and energy. I think it can also
be said that having a Computer Science degree has made Eric an invaluable
resource to all of us. We can be a little bit more Mark Zuckerberg because of
what we learn from Eric. He is definitely going to end up being a prolific
programmer, with his penchant for seeing the bigger picture, and his passion
for learning and reading docs. He only wishes that all his classmates had that
same passion to read Documentation as he does, so maybe he should lead a spike
or a group in Mod 3 where we do some reading of docs

##### Feedback from Devin

It was great working with you on our Firebase budget app. In fact, it's safe to
say that your ability to understand Firebase docs really quickly let us move
forward at a pace that allowed us to have a pretty sweet MVP (while helping
other teams figure out Firebase too). One thing that I really like about the
way you work is that you really try and make sure that the people you work with
understand what's happening and why. I think we were all team players on this
project and we did a really good job at staying calm under the pressure of the
time crunch. My only piece of feedback is your communication at the beginning
of this project. You should let your partners know if you're going to be absent
so we don't drastically jump to the conclusion that you're dead!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [microaggressions_original.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
* [Microaggressions 101](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

##### Takeaways from session

I came into this GearUp skeptical of the seriousness of 'Microagressions' and
its association with SJWs, but I leanred a lot about how harmful they can be
overtime and as a privileged white male how my lack of experiencing 'Microagressions' influenced my
thinking on the matter.


#### Journey Mapping

* [journey-mapping.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session

I learned that Journey Mapping is just as much about being empathetic and
considering emotional responses than it is about planning a strategy to execute product's vision.


### Grit

* [grit.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

#### Takeaways from session

##### a time at Turing when you’ve been tempted to give up
- Interpret that experience through the lens of grit
- I believe it’s possible for one’s own grit can fluctuate on both short and
  long-term cycles, depending on the circumstances and other external/internal
  factors. So sometimes one might be more vulnerable to giving in at certain
  times than others
- This gear-up reminds of of last module’s resilience Gear-Up, in which we
  discussed internal and external locus of control and one’s ability to
  overcome challenges/failure proportional to one’s internal locus of control
- Grit seems to tack on passion to the idea of that resilience/perseverance is
  directly proportional to success. In other words, one is more likely to
  overcome obstacles if they are interested/passionate about the thing that
  they are doing


##### 3 ways to imbue work to be more ‘filled with purpose’
1. view frustration and failure as a necessary part of the process of development
2. work on projects that are inherently interesting/you are passionate about/are meaningful
3. maintain a internal locus of control and a grow-mindset

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Bekah

#### Feedback for Dylan

Working with Dylan was a ‘breeze’(!) We decided early on to pair often and were
really effective as a team in catching eachother’s mistakes and using equal
participation in driving and conducting during pairing. Really enjoyed working
with Dylan, he’s witty, smart, and  light-hearted in the face of challenges and
making mistakes, which is perfect when pairing. Dylan did a great job with Sass
styling as well, which I’m less comfortable with, so I learned a lot about that
too! By pairing as much as possible, we stayed motivated and were very
productive in producing a great end product and given the chance I look forward
to working with Dylan again in the future!

#### Feedback for Devin

Really enjoyed working with Devin as our group’s project manager during our
Fire Bae project. She started work on our project with a great, albeit somewhat
ambitious mock-up/concept put together using Sketch which we later decided to
pivot on due to time constraints. Devin did a great job keeping our group
organized/staying on track throughout the weekend as we pivoted our project and
was instrumental in keeping us on track to deliver a working minimum viable
product ASAP ( given the shorter time frame than expected that we had to work
on our project). Right off the bat she had some great ideas/ambitions but was
also able to come up with necessary compromises when needed, and was great with
continuing communication throughout the project both in person and remotely on
Slack. Overall, I had a great time working with her and definitely benefited
from her ability to motivate our team to produce a decent end product despite
us not having time to complete our original ambitions. I look forward to
working with Devin again given the chance in the future!

#### Feedback for Kenia

#### Feedback from Mod1 Paring (Tim)


### Playing a Part

Given my experience and knowledge, I realize that I can be a valuable resource
for my peers, but I feel I could have done more to help out my fellow
classmates this mod with their questions. Although I've made improvements since
mod1, one weakness I have is in pairing, which is something I'd like to focus
even more on in Mod3, and my ability to be an effective partner and not just
_give away an answer_ or provide a solution myself by taking over the session
and banging out a solution, but guide others towards coming up with an
effective solutions. For me, this is a major challenge since I like to take
control and solve problems on their own, without thinking enough about other's learning and
ability to understand what I'm doing. For this reason, I feel I've been
hesitant to pair more and/or help other students out, since it's a significant
challenge for me to simplify solutions, examples, and explanations into an
easy-to-digest and rapidly understandable chunks, without just taking over and
trying to solve problems myself.

Explaining _why_ I am doing something in a particular way is also an area I'd
like to improve on. Overall, I feel I have places to improve with it comes to
community involvement and participation, including better communication and
committing more time to networking and professional development and making more
consistent contact with mentors and other outside resources.
