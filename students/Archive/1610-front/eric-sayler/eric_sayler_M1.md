## A: End of Module Assessment

### Notes
* Everything was there conceptually, but was rusty from working on game time during the past two weeks
* Changing the CSS height was simpler than he thought, could use a brush up on CSS

* Communication was good, could use a little more "why" and not just "what"

### Scores

#### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### JavaScript Style

* JavaScript needed refactoring, a bunch of long functions that needed to be broken down
* JavaScript was pretty DRY overall, but needed refactoring
* The event bubbling selections were too vague (using document instead of a specific container)
* Workflow was good technically, but there needed to be more conversation in pull requests
* Left in some dummy links in the HTML...shouldn't be there
* CSS was not DRY and could use some refactoring, but the styles matched the comp well

##### Feedback from Jeff

* Excellent planning and organization
* Great mindset for working with code
* Skilled at explaining things
* Use of methods/software I was unfamiliar with was frustrating at times
* Slightly sub-par communication

Going into the project, I was a bit worried about working w/ Eric. He's that guy that uses VIM, and actually understands at least half of what is going on in class. I was pleasantly surprised with the results though :slightly_smiling_face:

Eric is obviously very talented already, and regardless of his previous experience clearly has the right mindset for this type of work. He was rarely ever frustrated despite plenty of setbacks, and stayed confident that he could work his way through a problem. He was an excellent teacher whenever I didn't understand whatever witchcraft he was using that we'd never gone over in class, and was always happy to explain things. His desire to plan our attack before starting was greatly appreciated, and we stayed very well-organized throughout the project. His workflow is also amazingly efficient, and I'm not just enamored by VIM. Ok, fine, actually I think VIM is pretty awesome.

At the time I thought it would've been nice if he hadn't used VIM, RegEx, or other similar sorcery. Looking back on it, I'm actually glad to have gotten an introduction to all of it though. Communication could use a bit of improvement, but wasn't an issue often. On larger, more complicated projects it potentially could've been though.

Overall it was a pleasure working with Eric, and I look forward to picking his brain about VIM setup once I have the time to get into it. I'm a sucker for elaborate keybindings :slightly_smiling_face:

(feedback to me)

##### Feedback from Sam

- Thought we did really well as a pair by dividing up work and attacking the project in a way where we could both learn and take the most out of the experience.
- Appreciated you taking the initiative to set up the Waffle.io - I wouldn’t have created it if not.
- I know you were frustrated with my use of Git and appreciate your patience there.  You had more experience using Git and I appreciated your help there.
- Overall, I really enjoyed working with you on our first project.  I thought we did a pretty good job considering it was our first project!
- One piece of constructive feedback - with respect to the coding aspect of the project, I felt like you did jump into my JS code towards the end of the project and didn’t really engage with me on it and the changes you were making. As a result, I had to go back and change a bunch of things back to what I had created and redo the work to ensure I could move forward since I didn’t really understand the changes you had made.  I know you are more experienced with JS and coding languages in general, but I’d just encourage you to make sure future partners are able to follow along when pairing with you as you work through shared code. I know it isn’t easy to go slow and have to explain stuff - I will likely be there with partners as well in the future - but something to consider towards being a good partner/team member.


#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box GitHub URL](https://github.com/esayler/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Notes

* Should be using IDs in HTML for unique elements and sharing classes for CSS styling, HTML was otherwise clean
* CSS needed some refactoring since there was some repetition
* JavaScript was good, but could use some refactoring into smaller functions
* The searching and tag filtering had some unexpected user interaction where tags were selected, but if a search term was added then all of the results would appear regardless of what tags were selected
* Using localStorage to search through ideas and hide them; this can be done through the DOM so as not to go through localStorage and risk changing user's data
* Could use more conversation in PRs, but git/GitHub workflow looked good otherwise

##### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### HTML Style

- 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###### CSS Style

- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

###### JavaScript Style

- 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

- 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Collaboration

- 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

##### Feedback from Elijah

It was great working with you.  I really felt like you knew your stuff, and you were confident at every step.  The area I would challenge you in is code organization and teaching.  I think both of these can go hand-in-hand.  You bring a wealth of knowledge to the table and unique ways of attacking problems, so focus on organizing your code in a way that can be easily verbalized to others.  I really enjoyed learning from you.   Looking forward to working with you next mod!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Introversion

* [introversion.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session

The idea of extroversion and introversion to me seems to be somewhat scientific, but I can't get past a feeling that some of the theories and ideas
presented are not based on solid scientific evidence and are quite anecdotal. In conclusion, I felt that this gear-up was less useful,
but presented interesting ideas on how to view others' behavior and manage partner interaction during a project.

#### Resilience

* [resilience.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session

Thought this was the most useful/interesting gear-up during the module, had a effective discussion around how to be resilient in the face of adversities by
turning one's mind towards an internal locus of control, the feeling that one is in control of one's life and actions and that those actions have an
affect on one's personal success. The two articles opposing views gave me insight into the idea that knowing about resilience isn't the whole to one's problems,
that one must practice effective habits in order to develop resilience, and that resilience can be learned. It was interesting seeing a debate around internal locus
of control and my group's discussion revolved around striking a balance between to0 much internal locus of control and too little. The idea that one can have to
much internal locus of control, and how that can leave one to self-blame oneself for failures and lead to depression was eye-opening. All in all, our group felt that
in order to develop resilience on one's own (without outside motivation), one must be mindful of bad habits and self-blame but also strike a healthy balance of
feeling one is in control of one's life at all times.

### Vote your Conscience

* [vote_your_conscience.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

#### Takeaways from session

This session was more controversial, but we had a good discussion over one's right to vote and why one should exercise their constitutional right to vote.
Our group had some great outside perspectives on the US election, since some members were from or have traveled to foreign countries. Our discussion revolved
around whether or not voting really _counts_ and why one should do so, and with outside perspectives, why US citizens should not take their democracy and their right to vote for
granted. All in all, there were some tense moments of opinion but we had an effective discussion. Didn't think this gear-up was as useful as others.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Elijah

I think we really did well with following through with pairing as defined in our DTR, which was good practice for both of us. We were organized and I felt you communicated fairly well throughout the project. A few areas to work on: don’t be afraid to ask questions about ‘why’ during pairing sessions, which both of us could work on. There was a lot of dictation of ‘what’ to do (especially on my side), but not ‘why’ we were doing it. Also, I think you had several great design decisions that I wouldn’t have considered that made the project easier to implement, such as not to use an array within LocalStorage, etc. We paired much more than I have in my other projects which I think was great practice for explaining code changes and learning communication (still something I still need to improve on). One challenge: I would suggest you be more communicative when DTR expectations are broken, such as when I implemented the extensions on my own, which I realize was a mistake since it left you out of the loop on learning new stuff. My fault since I like to ‘solve problems’ when they arise and sometimes can be impatient! Overall, our project was a great learning experience for me since our frequent pairing challenged me to explain what we were doing in a simple and understandable way, a skill I’m planning on continuing to improve on in order to be a more effective partner and tutor to others.

#### Feedback for Justin

I was impressed with Justin’s ability to iterate and test much of our game’s most important features, such as player collision and physics, which were certainly a significant challenge. Also really appreciated Justin’s design abilities, both graphic and game design decisions. Our collaboration started out with us dividing and conquering with Justin continuing work on his physics test app while I focused on refactoring our application structure using ES6. We experienced frustration when working on separate code bases that diverged too much for a reasonable merge during the first week. One improvement would have been to decide on our project’s direction sooner so we could have collaborated more effectively from the beginning. Communication lacked a bit on our decisions on how to proceed during our first week as Justin worked on delivering a MVP through his original test/dev branch and I worked on refactoring his code into our main program. Our workflow would have been smoother if we had kept to collaborating on a single branch during our first week.  We spent a minimal amount of time pairing, so lots of valuable time was spent catching up on each other’s code changes. Overall, we learned that feature creep kept us from reasonably refactoring/consolidating our code bases easily and sooner than we should have, but this was a great learning experience that echoes likely problems that will arise from real-life production projects with multiple code bases. Although consolidating our features together into a main code base after the first week wasted some time that could have been spent refactoring and/or adding new features (with the addition of adding unneeded stress), overall I enjoyed Justin’s ambition and dedication to our project and am proud of our final deliverable. I look forward to working with Justin on the project in the future to improve the game’s performance, structure, and add additional features that we wished we had time to implement.

#### Feedback for Sam

 One thing we could improve on: I felt we were too focused on our own tasks; there could have been a little more balance throughout. Just a little gripe!  Anyway, from my point of view it seemed like you may have been resistant to pairing on JS, not sure if this is accurate or if you were hesitant/nervous because I might be more familiar with JS, but it seemed like you wanted to go off and do it on your own, which is fine, to each their own! Anyway, keep that in mind going forward, Turing really pushes pairing hard and so far I’ve been trying hard to get better at it myself, but its not a project deal-breaker by any means.


### Playing a Part

As someone with a bit more programming experience than many of my peers, I've tried to be of much as a help as possible while still reserving significant time for my own learning.
Given my experience and knowledge, I realize that I can be a valuable resource for my peers, but I feel I could have done more to help out my fellow classmates this mod
with their questions. One weakness I have is in pairing, which is something I'd like to focus on in Mod2, and my ability to be an effective partner and not just
_give away an answer_ but guide others towards coming up with an effective solutions. For me, this is a major challenge since I like to take control and solve problems on their
own, without thinking enough about other's learning and ability to understand what I'm doing. For this reason, I feel I've been hesitant to pair more and/or help other students out,
since it's a significant challenge for me to simplify solutions, examples, and explanations into an easy-to-digest and rapidly understandable chunks. Explaining _why_ I am doing
something in a particular way is also an area I'd like to improve on. Overall, I feel I have places to improve with it comes to community involvement and participation.
