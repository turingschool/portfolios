##### `TODO: Evaluation Scores`

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Walker Texas Rangerbox

* [Walker Texas Rangerbox](https://github.com/esayler/ranger-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

#### Evaluation Scores
###### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

###### Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

###### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### Movie Tracker (FilmFavs)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ejwill04/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

#### Evaluation Scores

###### Evaluator: Taylor
###### Notes: Elijah & Adam & Eric

###### **Spec**:

```
Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
```

###### Specification Adherence

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

###### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.

###### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### Feedback:
##### Feedback from Elijah

_Eric was a great partner on Movie Tracker.  He is well versed in the material and puts in the time to figure problems out.  Having paired with Eric in Mod1 as well, I’ve seen his abilities as a partner and teacher increase drastically.  It made working on this project really exciting.  The area I would challenge Eric in is to consider how he could make his code more organized and easier to read.  All in, Eric was a tremendous partner._

##### Feedback from Adam

_Working with Eric on Movie Tracker was a fun experience. Eric was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing or take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer. I feel that Eric could benefit by taking short breaks every 20-30 minutes when working as it seems he will power through several hours with no breaks. Eric was a great team member and I am glad we were put in a group together._

_Pass_

###### Feedback from Chelle

_Eric Sayler is a beast.  You can't stump this guy.  This doesn't go without hard work, however.  Eric and I worked on the Ember/Git Workflow project and spent many hours together stumbling our way through this project.  He was always a step ahead of me, but would slow down to make sure I understood the direction we were taking.  His contribution to the tech world will be profound, I have no doubt about that.  I would work with Eric again, any day of any week._

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session:

###### _Let's  say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?_

- Companies that are segregated will remain segregated and diverse companies will become more segregated

###### _Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the Point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?_

- PotP doesn't really prove that diversity adds value, it just proves that biased people will remain biased(segregated remains segregated), and that if people want desire diversity that diversity will happen

###### Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session:

Automation may have a huge impact on future society but it also may not be as big of a deal as some may think.
The same concerns about unemployment were made during the Industrial Revolution, with automation and AI/Machine Learning, the case for worrying about the future may be similarly overblown.
We really don't know what will happen, but we should have contingency plans in the case that many people can't
find work easily. UBI is one such possible policy that may help economies cope with massive unemployment, but it may not be enough. The real question is whether automation will disrupt the current norm of a global capitalist system, we may have to turn to some sort of post-capitalist system.


#### [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

##### Takeaways from session:

UBI has good intentions but may be an ineffective band-aid on a hemorrhaging national/global economy. It's not clear yet if automation may disrupt more jobs and current economies can create new ones, based on the speed of technological change. It's also not clear if the incentives that UBI seems to lack would hurt/help economies in the long run. Without economic incentives to find work, a capitalist economy would cease to function. Its possible UBI may not work without a post-capitalist economy, but we've seen through history that non-capitalist economies (such as centrally managed ones) don't seem to work. However,
it's certainly possible that AI could result in the return of centrally-managed economies, if it becomes advanced enough to do so effectively and accurately.

#### [Innovative Problem-Solving](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

##### Spotify Running Playlist Generator
###### Pitch

Create your own custom Spotify running playlists by sorting/organizing tracks by BPM from your own saved music/playlists.

###### Problem

Spotify has a built-in running playlist feature in their mobile app, but it doesn't allow you to create custom playlists based on your saved tracks/playlists, and you can't save songs you like while listening to one of their auto-generated/curated running playlists.

###### Solution

Bring in your personal private playlists and saved tracks in order to sort/organize them by BPM and save them to a new Spotify playlist that you can listen to during your run.

###### Target Audience

Spotify subscribers who like to go for runs and are into or interested in listening to music that matches thier particular running pace (based on BPM).

###### Which APIs will you use?

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Adam

_Adam made working on our "FilmFavs" project go much more smoothly than I expected! He is an excellent communicator and asks pertinent questions that tend to clarify details.  Adam helped motivate us to keep going when we were stuck and was instrumental in not only project planning, but also in thinking about application architecture and code organization, which I tend to neglect too often!  At times when pairing, Adam may have been hesitant to slow us down if we were going too fast, but he did well at keep us from going off on random tangents.  Adam was pleasant to work with and made easier a tough project where we didn't know how much we were going to get done at the beginning, especially since the back-end/SQL stuff was brand new to us. During the project, he and Elijah helped guide my direction and thinking and helped me analyze my thoughts and problem-solving techniques more carefully. They were both instrumental in making sure decisions were a team effort, and everyone was on the same page. I wish I could have a chance to work with Adam again! Instead, I wish Adam well at his new job; we'll all miss him in Mod4!_


#### Feedback for Elijah

#### Feedback for Chelle

_Working with Chelle made a tough project (Ember) progress much more easily than I initially expected. Chelle is a great communicator, asks great questions, and has a top notch workflow. She helped motivate us to keep going when we were stuck on problems.  When pairing, she was great at quickly catching mistakes and slowing us down if we were either going too fast or going down some sort of deep rabbit hole.  She also was great at making sure we kept on top of our goals, and helped make sure I didn't get too distracted with unnecessary features/over-engineering. Since Chelle doesn't take things too seriously, and is fun to work with, we were not only productive but also less stressed out overall. During the project, Chelle helped me learn not just technical skills but also more about myself, my workflow, and my habits. I'd definitely work with Chelle again!_
