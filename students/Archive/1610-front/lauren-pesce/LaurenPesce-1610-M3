# Lauren Pesce - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
  My focus was to become more confident in my skill level and learn/understand Redux. I also wanted to focus on more UX/UI and CSS design.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Projects

### Walker Texas Ranger Joke Generator

* [https://github.com/pescel/walker-texas-rangerBox]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html]()

First project using React-Router. A joke generator using an API that has a settings, favorites, and jokes page. 

##### Specification Adherence

2.5 - The application is in a usable state, missing a single favorites feature though solid attempt was made.

#### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### ColorPal

* [https://github.com/pescel/color-pal]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html]()

Personal project done in Redux. I created an app that allows the user to drag and drop a photo and display the photo with a unique color palette based on the most dominant colors in the photo. 

#### UX/UI Challenges 

* [https://github.com/pescel/side-nav]()
* [https://github.com/pescel/swipeable-cards]()


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Groovie Movies

* [https://github.com/pescel/groovy-moovyz]()
* [https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker]()

This is an app that pulls a list of movies from an API and allows the user to search and save favorites, as well as signing in to the app. 

#### Specification Adherence
4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### Javascript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing 

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

#### Workflow 

3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

#### Notes

Great job refactoring and getting the app into a working state over the last couple days of the project. Demonstrated a much clearer understanding of React/Redux architecture, and was able to solve bugs previously reported. Routing issues were resolved and worked splendidly. Testing should be slightly less linked to the HTML/DOM Content, but solid effort put in across the board there.

##### Feedback 

Chelle Tuerk: Lauren is an enthusiastic individual that has so much to offer!  We worked together on the React Redux movie project and I was witness to her putting in long hours and research to figure out the next best step to take.  I'm proud of our final project and it was a pleasure to work with her.  

Dylan Avery: Working with Lauren Pesce is a great experience. She is a dedicated programmer, who will engage a problem with 100% of her focus, and stick with it until it is solved. Lauren has a knack for looking at a whole range of possible solutions, and moving effortlessly from one to the other if it is what is required. She is a leader at Turing, both in our classroom, and in an official capacity as one of the co-leads of Verou Posse. At Verou Posse spikes she has done an incredible job engaging new students, and building relationships across cohorts both front-end and back-end. She is also a very good public speaker, as well as often the first person to speak up with an idea during a brainstorm. If I had any advice to Lauren it would probably be to continue to make time and space for the things that make you healthy and happy, and not to spend too much time fighting with a bug, if she needs to instead take a breather. 

### remEMBER 

* [https://github.com/pescel/1610-remember-9]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html]()

This was a project that incorporated git workflow with learning Ember. We built a task list. 

##### Feedback

Stephanie Andrews:  I am glad we were able to work together again this module!  We’ve come so far since our first project!  I really appreciate your ability to explore new problems and be open minded when it comes to new languages/concepts/frameworks!  In both projects we worked in you’re able to just dive right in!  Thank you for your patience when in pairing when I would get stuck on particular concepts.   Also, thank you for always being there to offer another perspective when I was stuck.  It was a pleasure to work with you again!!!


## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons 

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown]()

 This was a great gear up for those of us who are visual learners! The site was so great, and it helped me understand the idea of gentrification and diversity. I think it's sometimes important to go outside of your comfort zone, and it often helps you get a different perspective on things, learn about topics you're not familiar with, and make you grow as a person. 

#### Automation

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown)]()

  Taking time to think about the impact of automation was difficult for me, because I'm torn between feeling worried about it and excited. Since we now have the technology to implement into automated jobs, our world is going to be changing drastically in a small amount of time. Although this could improve our way of living, there is a threat to the economy and a lot of jobs that would be taken over. It was interesting to think about how I might have an impact on this as a developer, and I think I'm just going to have to be aware of it when making choices in my career. 



#### Universal Basic Income

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown]()

This was something that I had very little knowledge of before the session, which seems to be the pattern with most of the population. I'm in the middle when it comes to my stance on UBI, because I think there could be some big flaws and will bring up some divided opinions. On the other hand, after the last gear up it's nice to know that there is some form of a solution being thought of for lost jobs due to automation. I think this is a topic that people should be educated on and be aware of, and it'd be great to see it implemented in a small area as a test. 


### Professional Development Workshops
##### Flower Exercise 

* [https://gist.github.com/pescel/fcec237023d5899f33c895a991df608c]()

##### Turing Portfolio

*[https://www.turing.io/alumni/lauren-pesce]()

### Being a Community Member
  This mod I attended an event at galvanize that was about codePen and a girlDevelopIt work session at a co-working space downtown. It was eye-opening to realize how much we've learned in such a short amount of time, because there were a lot of people who went to these events who knew just as much as I did and have been working in the industry for a while. I also lead the Verou Posse along with Dylan and Lucy from 1610-BE.
