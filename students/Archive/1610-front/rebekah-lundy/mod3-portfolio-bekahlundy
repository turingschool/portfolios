# Bekah - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I wanted to feel really strong and confident in my skills this mod. I think within the last week I have started to feel that. It took a long time in this program to feel like a strong programmer so I am proud of myself for getting to the place that I am now.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Nourish

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/nourish)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

**Description**
We often get caught up in the latest fitness trends and fads. We try and count calories or drink more water, push ourselves to the limit and ignore what truly impacts our health and happiness. Nourish is an app for wellness. There are four types of wellness and health- physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. In this application, I am creating a habit-forming tracker to track these four categories in your busy, everyday lives. When you complete tasks, you will be celebrated for your achievements. Nourish is a positive, happy, and inspiring app for those wanting to change the way they live.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Walker Texas RangerBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/joke-generator)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

**Description**
Joke Generator using an api and react


**Evaluation scores**
Student: Bekah Lundy
Notes: Prioritized getting the functionality in place over the design, which allowed for getting all the features in. Good strategy and use of time on a tight deadline. Some areas where code can be refactored to reduce duplication and improve clarity with better naming conventions, but overall demonstrated a good understanding of react and the design patterns.

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

### Design

2.5 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

##Weather Project

*[Github URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/redux-weather-app)
*[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

**Description**
Used react and reduce to make a weather app

### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.
#### Feedback
From Sam-
I really enjoyed working with you on the redux project.  It was a really though project with a new framework but I thought you were a really great partner to pair with and figure it out.  I appreciated your patience and willingness to just sit down and figure stuff out together while being super positive, patient, and hard working.

My only piece of constructive feedback is to be more focal when discussing how the group is going to break up work.  Part of this project was focused on doing individual work - and using git workflow to manage - and, at times, I felt a bit pressured to direct people on what to do when I think it could have been better if people just volunteered and/or spoke up about what they wanted to work on. I think I probably could have been better about bringing that out in people but thought I’d mention it.

I think you are a great partner, Bekah, and would gladly work on another project with you!

From Anna-
Bekah and I worked together on the weather redux project. She isn't afraid to try things when she doesn't know the answer and is also a good researcher. We only paired a few times on this project, but I enjoyed working with her. When I was having difficulties with our third team member she was encouraging of my dealing head on with the issue. My only suggestion to her would be to trust her own knowledge. Bekah knows quite a lot and is a very good programmer, but as with many of us, doesn't always trust that she knows what she knows.

#### RemEMBER

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/1610-remember-1)
  * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

**Description:**
  We used ember to create a reminder app. We did some github magic throughout this project too.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback (Sam)-

I worked on the redux weather app with Sam. Sam was an awesome partner to have on a really intense project. He is a vary hard worker, positive and honest, and won’t stop working until the task is done. 
Sam and I paired quite a bit on this project. Sam is great at pairing. He listens, explains his thoughts very clearly, and is positive if things get hard.
The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is to be able to assign work out if you have too much on your plate. Otherwise being partners with you was awesome!
I am glad we got to work together this mod, you are a very strong developer!

Feedback (Anna)-

I worked on the redux weather app with Anna. Anna was a very hard worker and is very good at researching and learning about the topics in our project.
Anna and I only paired a few times on this project. Anna is very open, which is helpful for when I make mistakes. 
The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is to try to open to others opinions and thoughts, and to speak up right away if you do not feel that you are being heard. That way, we can solve problems very early on!
I am glad we got to work together this mod!

### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part

* I went to verou posse and participated in all of the gear ups

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

* Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
    * People are much more comfortable with hiring people like them and like their community. This makes diversity terribly hard to achieve. Jobs will be looking for those similar to them.
* Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
    * Diversity quotes are a good thing to consider. I think that it is really trying to do something good. It may make those people feel isolated, and like they are only there for the companies quota, but it is normally out of good heart.
* Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
    * It is hard to think of other strategies, I cannot think of anything that would fix the problem, but something that is important is to try and be aware of this problem and to drop any feelings of seeking others like them.
* PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
    * To be very open and understanding of others, and to want to meet other who are not like them.
* PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
    * Very effective, visual examples make things a lot easier for me to read and be interested in and understand.

#### Automation

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

I loved the automation video, I think that is was super informative. This was probably my favorite gear up ever. The group discussions were really honest and open and that was awesome.  
   
#### Universal Basic Income

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

* How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?
    * Automation is becoming more advanced and more highly skilled. Jobs are diminishing, and our population is increasing. Jobs will require more skill, training, and experience.
* What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?
    * He has a better reputation to say these things, he is a leader in this industry and has more of an understanding than a random person. I think a lot of people can see this happening but for a leader to say something, it is different and more real.
* Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?
    * UBI is giving people an income. People want this because their jobs are getting replaced by automation, and some do not want it because they think it is unfair to get money for doing nothing.
* Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?
    * Yes, absolutely. We have a responsibility to keep people informed and be considerate and helpful. I think that we do have an impact and we can make changes.
