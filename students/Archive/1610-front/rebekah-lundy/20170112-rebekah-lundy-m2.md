# Bekah Lundy - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(This mod I have been working on a lot. I have been really trying to work on my confidence and how much I believe in myself. I have always worried about not being good enough or not being smart enough to pass the module, but I am working on identifying when this happens, and how to stop these thoughts from happening. I wanted to become really familiar with the material so I could prove to myself that I had an understanding. I will continue working on my confidence. I think I have grown and learned a lot about myself during this mod.)

#### (Shoot the Breeze)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/shoot-the-breeze)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

(We created a messaging app that uses firebase for logging in.)

# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

 - Application knows a lot. Lets move some stuff around
 - Appreciate not loading lo-dash.
 - Once we decouple application we should see testing go up.

## Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Component Architecture

* 3 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.


## User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## CSS/Sass Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

### Feedback To Me

(It was great working with Bekah on the Shoot the Breeze project! Aside from being from the land of 10,000 lakes (which makes her awesome by default), Bekah is a hard worker, easy to communicate with and constantly working to better understand the confusing concepts we are learning.

All things considered I thought the project couldn’t have gone smoother. We made a pretty straight forward plan, built it out piece by piece and came out of it with a good-looking and functioning application. And, I felt we were both able to elevate our skills along the way, learning the nuances of Firebase, React and good old fashioned vanilla JS.

My only advice would be to be ok with, nay, embrace the unknown. Be ok with not knowing something and use it as fuel to figure it out. You’re very smart. Don’t let the fear of looking or feeling “dumb” prevent you from asking questions and striving to learn more.

I think this project might be the best I’ve been a part of so far and look forward to the opportunity to work with Bekah again. Thanks for being a solid teammate!)

#### (Fire-bae Project (Budget App))

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bekahlundy/firebae)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

(We created a budget app that uses react, react router, and firebase)

# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:
- tests were mad lit
- loved the attention to accessibility
- would like to see some of the components refactored
- loved the helper function.

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.


## Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.


## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.


## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.


## HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. The testing in this project shows that the students dedicated themselves to overcoming obstacles and figure out how to test parts of the application that were otherwise “hard to test.”

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

## Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints

### Feedback To Me

(I enjoyed working with Bekah.  As a team member, she is dedicated, helpful, flexible and communicative.  (Our breaks were lit!!!)  She actively sought to share her knowledge, which was incredibly helpful for her team!  Bekah has an innate sense for design and excellent Sass/Sketch skills that greatly benefited our team and out project!  Additionally, her javascript and react skills are strong.  If I dig for constructive feedback, it might be helpful for future projects if Bekah shares more of her opinions about code architecture and style.  Overall, it was a pleasure working with her! -Stephanie Andrews)

(Bekah is one of my favorite people, and I am really glad she found her way to Denver to attend Turing.  Bekah is one of the best listeners in our class, and she does a great job of making everybody feel like they belong here at Turing. I was really impressed at how quickly Bekah started working in Sketch after coming into Turing with a lot of Illustrator experience. A lot of times I think it is hard for us to not use our favorite software, but she didn’t even hesitate to make the switch after Lauren recommended we try it. She is a very gifted and passionate designer and developer and I look forward to working with her more in the future.” -Dylan Avery)

## D: Professional Skills
(We worked in groups and discussed current topics regarding the community, the class, or personal wellness.)

### Gear Up
#### (Micro Aggressions)

* ([GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

(In this gear up, we learned about micro aggressions in school and the workplace. I think that this lesson was very important, a lot of people are not aware of micro aggressions. I liked that we were put into groups with random people, it made for really good conversation. )

#### (Journey Mapping)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

(In the gear up, we learned about journey mapping. We learned what it means and how to do it. We got to work in small groups and interview each other on everyday struggles that we have been through. I did not think that this gear up was as effective as others I have been to. I feel that I did not learn as much from this gear up. )

#### (Grit)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

(I enjoyed talking about grit with my classmates. We learned what grit was and discussed it in small groups. I believe that it great for us to talk to each other about such a personal thing. I think we all learned a lot from each other, and how we can work together and work through projects.)


### Professional Development Workshops

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/MULIMo5e/bekah-lundy-job-board)

I believe that the workshops were all extremely helpful. Meg and Leah are fantastic at their job, and made me feel a lot less nervous or scared about looking into jobs.

For project management, I think I will need to work on being more confident and show my opinions. I will continually work at this until I am comfortable leading a group of people. My feedback talked about this quite a bit. I need more confidence and to know that I am smart and capable.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(I worked on Shoot the Breeze with Mike. Mike was an awesome partner to have on a really intense project. He is an extremely hard worker, sets his goals high, and won’t stop until he gets the product he wants. His passion for this program shows every step of the way.

Mike took a lot of time making sure that I felt comfortable with our code. If I wasn’t understanding something, he would go out of his way and sit down with me, teaching me until I understood. Mike cared about my well-being and how I was doing with things. This took a lot of stress off of me and made my time much easier, as well as making the project more enjoyable. I believe that he helped my confidence with React and made me a better developer. 

The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is about taking time for yourself and taking breaks from the projects. I know you would often go home an code all night, and I think you need to make sure that you take time off and breathe a little!

The project we worked on together turned out great, and I believe we both learned a lot.  Thank you so much for being such an awesome partner! 
)

### Being a Community Member

(I paired with Bekah numerous times early in the mod. I really enjoyed pairing with her and look forward to again soon. She was really great about helping me break down functions to the smallest part and get me to work through the problems. I learned a lot working with her and she made me feel very comfortable. She was also someone I was able to confide in during those first few weeks when I was feeling very overwhelmed and she made herself available to help with anything I needed. Thanks Bekah! -Staci McWilliams)

### Playing a Part

(I attended many different posse groups this mod. It was great to get a variety of lessons! I also attended a few of the speakers. I paired with the mod one students often. )
