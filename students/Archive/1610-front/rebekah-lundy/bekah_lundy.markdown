# Bekah Lundy - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(This module I wanted to accomplish a lot. I was determined to succeed at Turing. I came into this pretty scared and unsure of myself, and I hoped that by the end of mod one I would believe in myself a lot more. I wanted to meet lots of new people and create awesome relationships. I wanted to find out more about myself by doing this program and I wanted to prove to myself that I can work really hard and accomplish something great.)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(We designed our own website to practice HTML and CSS)

#### (Personal Site)

* [https://github.com/bekahlundy/personal_site]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/personal-site-first-draft.html]

(I created a professional personal site to showcase my current and past projects. It will be used on resumes and be sent to future employers.)


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(We were put into groups to learn how to collaborate on projects)

#### (Number Guesser)

* [https://github.com/bekahlundy/number_guesser_v2]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]

(We created a web application that took an input number and compare it to a random one. It would then tell you if your guess was too low or too high)


### Comments:
they did a really good job, they went and totally refactored it after they built it the first time. JS was clean, reusable, both could speak to all of it. well done.)

(
### UX/UI Expectations
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations
	3.25 - had this for phase 3: Add additional inputs that allows the user to specify what the minimum and maximum numbers should be.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
)

### Feedback to Me

(Hi Bekah! You were a fantastic partner on our first project, and there were a couple of things that really stuck out to me in a positive way.  First, I really appreciated that you always had a positive attitude, even when we restarted our project.  Second, I loved that you weren’t afraid to seek out help when we would get stuck.  

I think you’re in a great place in terms of your knowledge and work ethic, so my challenge to you is to use your position to continually grow as a community member and leader.  Don’t be afraid to share what you’ve accomplished and voice your opinions.  You’re doing great work and bring a lot to the table.  I can’t wait to work with you next mod!)

#### (Linked List)

* [https://bekahlundy.github.io/linked_list/]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]

(We created an application that took title's and url's and created a book-mark-like list out of them)

### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
Fundamental JavaScript Style
 3.5

### Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style
3.5	- some small structural adjustments would make for more robust and semantic HTML. Overall well done, could have used one last fine-tuning pass.


### CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Feedback To Me

Overall you were a great partner to work with not only because you're a nice person and excellent team member, but because your willingness to learn and work equally contributed immensely to the success of our project. Without your work on the CSS and jQuery we would not have been able to deliver a viable product. My only constructive criticism would be to speak up more if you want to take control of the coding or want to struggle through something without your partner just taking over(like I did... I think). Honestly though, this was one of my favorite projects because it was so easy to work with you and plan out our goals. Thanks!


#### (Idea Box)

* [https://github.com/bekahlundy/ideaBox]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]

(We created an application that took ideas and put them onto the page with local storage)

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### CSS Style

3.5 -- needs a pass to refactor/organizing, overall well organized

### JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Collaboration

3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

### Feedback To Me

Bekah - I am so proud of what we accomplished for this IdeaBox project! You have an incredible sense of workmanship and it was such a pleasure to be partnered with you. I was really impressed by your organization skills in keeping our code neat and concise. You should be confident in your abilities and proud of what you’ve done so far.

#### (Game Time)

* [https://github.com/bekahlundy/Game-Time-]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html]

(We created a game using a canvas. We had to think about all the logic to create the game frogger. We used constructor functions, prototypes, testing, and more.)

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

missing directives on how to play (i.e. am i using my mouse? the arrow keys?)

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

No functionality is tested, presence of functions is covered. needed a refactor of the codebase to make testing more straightforward. got stuck with dealing with canvas + tests.

* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### JavaScript Style

soft 3, significant amount of working code is in the index.js file. needs to be refactored.

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Feedback To Me
Bekah, working with you was honestly so much fun. Your positivity made our
stressful times through this project seem much less intimidating. I think our
game was a huge success and i’m so proud that we made this! I thought that
we were both really vocal about how to split up work and I think our collaboration
with each other was great. One area of improvement that I saw while working
with you would be to make sure you focus on our problems before you help others.
For example during one of our merge conflicts I had a game that was not working.
Before I could talk to you about the problem you went over to help someone else
with their game before I could talk to you and It stressed me out. In the future you
can think about being more aware of conflicts in your team and I will work on  
being more vocal about my concerns.


## D: Professional Skills
(We worked in groups and discussed current topics regarding the community, the class, or personal wellness.)

### Gear Up
#### (Resilience)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown]

(I enjoyed talking about resilience with fellow Turing students. First of all, it was good to hear that everyone struggles through turing. We all got to talk about bouncing back and how we deal with hard weeks. I also enjoy getting together with other Turing students from all different cohorts. You can really learn a lot. We talked about why being pushed so hard makes us resilient, and how mod one can teach us how the rest of the courses need to be treated. It is nice to be able to have serious and real talks with strangers instead of just small talk.)


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

* [Workshop URL]()
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

(takeaways from session)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(While I didn’t have an opportunity to partner with Josh this module, we got to work together many times. Josh has gone out of his way to help me through multiple code problems. He is someone I can count on to be there supporting me. We often sat down and worked through things together, both bouncing ideas off of each other until we figured something out. Josh is a wonderful addition to our class, I am genuinely excited to be paired with him in the future.)



### Being a Community Member

(Outside of working with Bekah on Linked List, I was always able to count on her to be empathetic in helping me work through problems whether it was a project or simple Github problem. Bekah is incredibly knowledgable about what she’s learning, has a great capacity to help others and put herself in their situation, and communicate what is going on. Not only is she a great peer to work with, but she’s also a great friend and contributes to the greater Turing community everyday with her friendly face and willingness to help on anything. -Noah Peden)

(Bekah Lundy is not only a very solid programmer, but a terrific human being. I never had the pleasure of working with her but she was always the first place I would turn for help. Not only technical help regarding code, but help when I’m feeling down in general. I don’t think I have ever had an interaction with her that hasn’t ended with some variation of the the words, “you can do it.” In a program this difficult mentally and emotionally, it’s important to have people like her to provide support to those who need it. She is a huge asset to this class and I look forward to working with her. -Joshua Small)

### Playing a Part

(I attended the Bezos posse twice a week almost every week. We come together as a group often, and I was highly involved. We did challenges outside of Turing, and the team I was on ended up winning. I also attended the lunch roulettes and the Friday speakers as much as possible. I believe that the community days are very important, and I am happy to participate.)
