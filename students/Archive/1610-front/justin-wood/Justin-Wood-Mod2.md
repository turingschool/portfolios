Front-End Mod2 - Team: Dylan Avery


We were to use my teammates old project, IdeaBox, that he did from Mod 1 and to update the code with ES6, webpack, Sass, Babel, and selenium tests. The project was mostly the same as Mod1 IdeaBox with no new major features. Dylan already had the original project’s extensions in so we mostly focused on heavily refactoring the code and updating/learning es6 and sass. 

Instructor: Meeka

Comments:

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


#### Feedback


Justin is one of my favorite people, and I am really glad he found his way up from Houston to our city of Denver. When talking about the way things work, or should work, Justin’s eyes light up, and he becomes this really happy person and its really a great feeling to work with someone like that. I know Justin doesn’t really love his amenities here in Denver, but its still really impressive to see him be the last person to go home every night. There are times where Justin has been rumored to have been in LoDo until 3AM, still learning. Because of this, Justin is able to make large amounts of progress in a very short amount of time. I don’t doubt that he could probably learn a new language on his own while still attending Turing. And thank you for bringing so many cool Board Games to school, and for patiently explaining the rules to all of us.

#### Weatherly

*[Weatherly](https://github.com/jwood11atx/weatherly)
*[Weatherly Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Front-End Mod2 - Team: Devin Beliveau

Weatherly’s goal was to teach us how to interact with web-API’s and how to visualize data. It was a short project but very informative. We focused on using React and ajax mostly. 

***Project not graded***

#### Feedback

It was great getting to work with you on Weatherly. I really enjoyed the fact that we were both on the same page in regards to wanting to take time to ourselves and simply learn as much as we could about React before we tried to dive into the project. It was a little stressful not starting the project right away, but in the end, I think we made the right decision by researching before we tried to code. A lot of people in past mods complained about the Weatherly project, but I think we did a good job and I feel like we both learned a lot.

### Shoot the Breeze

*[Shoot the Breeze](https://github.com/jwood11atx/shoot-the-breeze)
*[Shoot the Breeze Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

Front-End Mod 2 - Team: Jeff Buss

Shoot the Breeze is a small chatroom app. Users log in with their gmail account and then are loaded the chat history and list of users who have messaged in the past. The user can also filter the conversation by clicking on a user name or they can search through the messages with a input filter field. We used firebase to store users and chat history. We used react to build the app and enzyme to test. We were given a style guide to follow and used Sass for styling.

Instructor: yung-jhun

Comments:

- Great group interaction
- Opportunities in code to refactor
- Test are great, would like to see more sinon tests
- Tests will improve once the state decoupled.

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Component Architecture

3 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.
User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints
Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

#### Feedback

Working with Justin was a pleasure. At first I was a bit worried about splitting up tasks the way we did, but in the end was glad we did it the way we did. Picking our weaknesses and concentrating on those turned out to be a great idea. This ended up being a good exercise in delegating tasks, and seeing them out to the end. I'd love to pair w/ Justin again on an even more complex, longer, multi-person project to give more critical feedback lol, but the sailing was smooth this time around. Kudos to Justin, as I was able to come up w/ criticism for everyone else. Also, his dedication to the project - especially on the final night writing more complex tests into the wee hours of the morning - did not go unnoticed.

### Nimble Network a.k.a. FireBae 


* [FireBae](https://github.com/jwood11atx/nimbleNetwork)
* [FireBae Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html

Front-End Mod 2 - Team: Adam Rice and Josh Small

For our final Mod2 project we decided to do Nimble Network, which is actually just a contacts list with a “notes” field added. Having done a few projects in React already, we decided to challenge ourselves and do the project in React Native despite not being taught Native yet. For the most part things went smooth and we grew as developers with each new bug/issue that arose from dealing with Native. The project was to create a networking app that allows you to login and manage a contacts list of the people in your network. Each contact can have name, primary email and phone, secondary email and phone, social media links, and a notes section. There is also a “follow up” button to toggle as a reminder to follow up with this person at a later date. Contacts that are followed are highlighted and at the top of your list. We used firebase to store data.


## Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

## Design

3.5 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

## User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

## Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints


#### Feedback

Working with Justin Wood during the final project of mod two was great. Justin is very good at problem solving independently as well as with  a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and encouraged our group to try React Native. The quality that I admire most about Justin is his ability to focus his attention fully to one issue and not get distracted until he has resolved that issue. Regarding areas of improvement Justin often will be silent while coding and could improve his interaction with partners while problem-solving. He could also benefit from utilizing branches in GitHub and closing Issues via Pull Requests. Justin led by example throughout the project by consistently working later than everyone and arriving first to the classroom in the mornings.

I don't think I need to express how talented Justin is as a developer. All of us in mod 2 are aware of Justin's ability to take to a new language. Even if he insists that it's based on the amount of time he spends in front of a computer, he still has a knack for retaining information and just generally understanding computer logic. He was always willing to help out if I got myself into a difficult problem, that is, if you can remove his head from the computer when he is immersed in a particularly difficult issue. I know it can be difficult, I can sometimes have the same issue, but if you could try to tear yourself away from the computer to provide at least a "give me a second" to someone in your group, that would be helpful. Overall great project and I look forward to working with you in the future.


## D: Professional Skills

Things I’ve learned about myself the past two mods is that my lack of multitasking is far worse than I realized. It’s kind of a doubled-edged sword because I think it allows me to dive into my code for hours on end but I also realize it hurts me as a partner in projects. I’ve tried to be more aware of my tunnel vision when it’s happening but in my feedback from my projects tell me I still do it. I feel like I’ve done a better job with helping people though. I’m still putting in a lot of hours with other students even outside of my scheduled pairings for mod1 students. I think I’m getting better at teaching and learning to be more clear with what I am explaining. 


### Gear Up
#### Journey Mapping

* [Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This was a good exercise in empathy. I think it’s good to really focus on the user’s experience and feelings. When given the chance to interview a user, I think we are now better prepared to ask the right questions and help identify what the user is thinking and feeling better. Unfortunately, I turned in the actual journey map we created without taking a picture of it. But I do have the rough interview notes that I took during the interview.

*[Interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGz9WK70zPWaNLqW2RffTj6JuZ3EimDmTfMI_Xale4g/edit)

#### Grit

This was the most interesting Gear Up for me this mod. I didn’t realize this, but from my group I learned that I am perceived to have a tremendous amount of grit. From the provided definition of grit in the exercise, grit is just as much passion as it is perseverance. I always thought of grit along the same lines as the “grind”. 100% effort and stubbornness to give up. I enjoy coding a lot and I put a lot of time and effort into growing as a developer, but I never imagined myself with grit. I just keep going because it’s what I want to do, not because I have to. I also wanted to mention that I completely agree with the author about being against schools trying to force grit into curriculum and standardized testing. I truly think that will do more harm than good. Anyone can learn to have grit, but it has to be their decision. I don’t think passion for a topic can be taught and forcing it on students will result in an equal force of resistance.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation


### Giving Feedback


I did not get a chance to actually be paired with Noah on a project, but we have spent a lot of time this module coding together. Working with Noah is always fun, light-hearted, and enjoyable. He works hard and is always willing to put in the time to learn something new. While working with Noah on his projects, I've noticed that not only is he a fast learner but also a great team member. I envy his communication skills and the charismatic vibe he brings to every situation. I
genuinely look forward to the day we get to actually pair on a project for class.




### Being a Community Member


What can one say about pairing with Justin, that hasn't been said? He is a very intelligent individual that doesn't mind staying late to help you understand a problem. If I don't understand something I like to go to a couple of different people to see if one of their explanations clicks for me, but with Justin I am able to ask follow up questions and have him explain things I don't understand more thoroughly, or in a different way. 

He has been great to pair with, and offers a couple of idea to solve a problem depending on which way you feel most comfortable with.

Justin is an amazing teacher. His ability to talk through the code and give suggestions on how to implement solutions was incredibly helpful. He is a very strong asset to Turing.  I hope to one day possess the skills that Justin has.

You are very knowledgeable and helpful with any questions I have and an absolute pleasure to work with. Keep up the positive energy.

### Playing a Part

Regretfully I didn’t get to attend events like I wanted and I feel like I’m finally in a place that I can start attending meetups. I’ve already made plans with a network friend to attend some react meetups when I get back from break. I joined a new posse this mod and tried to be more active but I feel like the posse strayed from the reasons I joined. Next mod a few students and I are starting a new posse that’s dedicated to JS with teaching and tackling codewars and exercism problems for people who want to push their JS to that next level. To also help students relieve some stress and network a little, I helped put together a board game club that meets thursdays and fridays. I also helped a lot of mod 2 students outside of my scheduled pairings with mod 1 students. 


## Final Review

### Notes

Keep track of the portfolio all mod so it's less of a headache

Run a posse, keep teaching
