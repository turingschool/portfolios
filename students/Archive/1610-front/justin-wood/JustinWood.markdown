# Justin Wood - Mod1 Portfolio


## Areas of Emphasis


Learn as much as I can about html, css, and javascript. I also wanted to get back in the hang of working in groups and in a team.


## Rubric Scores


Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:


* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 2
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3




## A: End of Module Assessment


Notes

Solid JS and jQuery, needed some refactoring (into functions and consolidating up jQuery selections) but not enough time in the end
Completed phase 1 and phase 2
No issues in workflow, very proficient with Atom
Collaboration was definitely improved from mock assessment, wanted to hear more about "why" you are writing the code and not so much as to "what" code you are writing
Scores

Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### Number Guesser


*[Number Guesser](https://jwood11atx.github.io/Number-Guesser/)
*[Number Guesser Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)


Front-End Mod1 - Week2 Project - Team: Annastasia Psitos


Build a number guesser website/game. The user inputs 2 values for the range of the number to be guessed and then clicks start. Upon clicking start, the website randomly generates a number between the 2 numbers provided by the user. Then the user keeps inputting a number into the field until they guess correctly. When guessed correctly, the game then increases the number range by 20 and generates a new number to be guessed.


#### UX/UI Expectations

	3.25 - some layout bugs on iPhone 5, otherwise well executed.

#### Functional Expectations

	4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style

	3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Comment:

They got off to a rocky start on the first day of the project and didn't balance the work/effort equally or fairly. They regrouped and recovered very strongly, and both made a big effort to work together and learn from the project and pairing experience. Could have a been a discouraging project, but they turned it around and ended very positively. Great job!


#### Feedback


Thank you for all the work you did on this project, especially all the JavaScript you did to make our project work as well as it did. I know we both had some communication issues at the beginning, but I appreciate that you came to me directly so we could talk things through and that you grabbed a pairing session for me! I think your idea of us each working on the parts that we are weaker on is an excellent one and I recommend we both try and integrate that into our next projects. Your teaching style also improved and I was grateful that you were able to walk me through all the JavaScript steps so I could understand it and made me define things, which solidified them in my head.


#### Linked List


*[Linked List](https://jwood11atx.github.io/linked-list/)
*[Linked List Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)


Front-End Mod1 - Week3 Project - Team: Dan Grund


Linked List is more or less a website bookmark system. User types in name of the website and the web address and then clicks Enter to pin a bookmark to the right of the screen. Once a bookmark is created you are able to mark it as read with the “read” button or delete it. There is also a section under the Enter button displaying the number of links, read links, unread linke, and a trashcan icon to delete all of the marked “read” links.
#### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
#### Workflow
4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
#### HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
#### CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


#### Feedback
Justin, great work on this. I appreciate you taking the lead on the project and your grasp of the material so far. Your code is efficient
and well factored, and I respect your organization and attention to detail/focus on readability.
Thank you for explaining how to utilize regex. Your workaround for the trashcan highlighting yellow on hover was a stroke of brilliance
as well.




### Idea Box


*[Idea Box](https://jwood11atx.github.io/idea-box/)
*[Idea Box Project Sheet](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)


Front-End Mod 1 - Week4 Project - Team: Kenia Farias


Idea Box is an organizational tool for your ideas. User inputs a title of title of their idea and the idea itself into the input fields and then clicks save. Upon clicking “save”, your idea is appended to the idea box field where it is listed in order with most recent posts at the top. I included a time stamp to the bottom of each idea in case the user wants to know when they had the idea. Once posted, the user is able to upvote or downvote their ideas and then are able to click the “sort” button to reorder the list with highest votes at the top and lowest at the bottom. A second click of “sort” will reverse the list. The user may also search their ideas for with the search input field. The search looks through titles and text bodies to match the searched term. If the user wants to remove the idea from their idea box they simply just click the X button. Also, all of the users ideas are placed in localstorage so upon loading the website the user is back to where they left off with their ideas.


#### Specification Adherence

	4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.








#### HTML Style


	3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


#### CSS Style

	3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


#### JavaScript Style

	3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Workflow

	3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


#### Collaboration

	3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


#### Comments:

JavaScript looked pretty good, but there were some large functions that needed breaking down and refactoring, for sets of variables that are needed within a function, could break these out into a function that returns an object with these variables
git workflow was good, but there were some large commits and needed more conversation in the PRs
Alignment and width of buttons/input fields was getting off compared to the comp especially when the window size was wide


#### Feedback


Justin, I was a little nervous to work with you because you are so much more
advanced, but after doing our DTR I felt super re-assured that you were willing
to go at my speed. I really appreciated that you let me take on a lot of the
javascript and took on more of a mentor role and it helped me become
much stronger at writing code. One thing I would suggest is taking some time
to yourself every once in while. You are very focused and driven, but I do
feel like you need to step away and take more breaks. Overall i think we worked
really well together and I appreciate your patience.


### Game Time

Front-End Mod 1 - Week5 Project - Team: Eric Sayler


Game Time is final project for Mod1 Front-End students. We are given a list of 10 games to make over the next 2 weeks. With approval from the instructors, my partner and I wrote a game proposal and decided to create a game that wasn’t on the list. It is a 2 player game where each player controls a character on screen and the objective is to jump on the other player’s head to score a point. The first player to 20 points wins. We also allowed each character to have a projectile which stuns the other opponent temporarily when hit. It is a 2d platformer game so we had to include physics simulation with gravity, friction, and velocity to give the player smooth movement when jumping from platform to platform around the map.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)


### Gear Up
#### Resilience


* [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)


Mostly that resilience is a trait that can be learned and taught. There will always be cases where, because of genetics, people are on an extreme side of the spectrum. But overall, when an event happens, good or bad, it is how the individual person reacts to the event that determines if it is a tragedy or not. An event is an event, it isn’t innately tragic. It is just an event that has happened a million times before and will continue to happen. Being human is a double-edged sword in that we can overcome and withstand a lot of bad in our lives, but we also have the capability to make a small problem into something huge. It really just comes down to how you react to what has happened and if you shut down and succumb to depression and sadness or if you take things for what they are and move on.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation


### Giving Feedback


I did not get a chance to actually be paired with Noah on a project, but we have spent a lot of time this module coding together. Working with Noah is always fun, light-hearted, and enjoyable. He works hard and is always willing to put in the time to learn something new. While working with Noah on his projects, I've noticed that not only is he a fast learner but also a great team member. I envy his communication skills and the charismatic vibe he brings to every situation. I
genuinely look forward to the day we get to actually pair on a project for class.




### Being a Community Member


Although I was not paired with Justin on any projects, Justin has proved more than I can count that he is incredibly willing to help anyone with any coding problem they might have, whether it’s a tiny CSS moving a button problem or a massive “OMFG MY GAME BROKE” javascript problem. If it was not for Justin, I would not have had a viable project to present for Idea Box. He personally stayed until about 1 in the morning the day before Idea Box evals to help Jon and I re-write our entire JS file. Justin is not only an exceptionally skilled programmer, he’s a great friend and team member who is constantly contributing to the greater Turing community through his caring and coding.


### Playing a Part


I try to attend as many events as I can and take part in my posse. I also have held a couple tutoring sessions with classmates to help with their projects and understanding material.
