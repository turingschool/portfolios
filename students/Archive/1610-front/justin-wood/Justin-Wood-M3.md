#### Boardgame App
Self directed project that I decided to make an app that makes easier use of the main boardgame website BGG. Unfortunately the api for the website was also bad, so I wrote a scraper in Selenium to get the data that I need and created my own database with fire base. I also wrote a backend server with Express to handle my end points and api calls. I also wrote a recommendation algorithm that takes a user's favorites list and recommends them 10 games based on their selections. The project covered a lot of stuff that I haven't learned but overall went well and will continue to improve it in the future.

Scores: NA

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Universal Basic Income
The idea and intentions of UBI are good, but I think it will be abused to death. With automation becoming more invasive we as a country will have to figure out something for all of the Americans who lose their jobs. The incentive to work will diminish if everyone gets a paycheck which is the main concern from pollers. The fear that it will promote laziness is real. I think having a base income supplemented to people who work would be good, but I question if the increase of money everyone has will just increase the cost of basic needs and we will just be right back where we are.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
### Giving Feedback
Mike is easily one of the most driven individuals in our cohort.  His focus and determination were huge assets while working on our movie tracker redux project. Additionally, he’s exclusively been the only person to be a catalyst in my learning here at Turing. Mike's professionalism and hardwork helped produce a project that I'm proud of. I would happily work with him again and hope to in the future.

### Playing a Part
I go to meetups, turing events when I can, and wrap-ups. I also spend a lot of time with other students tutoring and being available to answer their questions about code and their projects.

The flower exercise has helped me become more aware of my strengths and weaknesses. It also has helped me consider more about what is important in a career and in life in general. Some things I have learned are that I am more of a mind, sensory, and entertainment kind of person. I have found myself drawn to a career more focused on human interaction, art, and bringing entertainment and joy to people.
	
"I want to be a part of a company that creates something that brings entertainment and happiness to people. I have a degree in 3d art and would love to somehow implement that back into my career. I also would love to be in an environment where I am challenged and learn new things. I’m not tied down to anyone place and wouldn’t mind moving to the coast or staying in the mountains, maybe even moving back to Texas. "

###Mod4 Action Plan

My longterm goal is to be working as a software/web developer somewhere that I really enjoy. Hopefully it will be a place that creates something fun, helpful, and creative for people to enjoy. The technology/language used isn't as important to me. I'm open to a small company but I really just want to be a part of a community and in a culture that pushes me to be better. I would like to go back to Texas but I am open to moving where ever there are opportunities. I would also love to be somewhere with strong mentorship to help guide me to be the best developer I can be.

####Strategy:
I haven't been able to really dig in and start applying and job hunting like I've wanted to, but I have already reached out and contacted 2 companies in Houston that I would really like to work for and am developing those relationships.

My plan for mod 4 is to have 30min-1hour everyday spent job searching, applying, reaching out/networking. This can happen mornings before class the days I get there early, during lunch, or if necessary, right after class. I feel I will be more proactive in the morning and at noon to meet this goal because I am normally glued to a project after class and at night. Also, afterclass/evenings can be spent at meetups to fill my hour goal for the day.

By the end of mod 4 I would like to have a job offer lined up and have been on multiple interviews.
