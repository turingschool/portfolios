# A: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

  #### These projects were really great and helped to improve on my React knowledge and on working through projects on my own.

## ToDoBox Pivot

* https://github.com/kfarias/2DoBox-Pivot2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot

   This project helped us to really dive into es6 by refactoring old code that was written in es5.

     ##### Instructor: yung-jhun

     ##### Comments:

   * established some really good rhythms

   * I would like to see some of those things teased out just a little more
   Would like to see functions broken out into smaller pieces early and often let the test's guide you!

   ### Specification Adherence

   ##### 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

   ### Accessibility

   ##### 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

   ### User Interface

   ##### 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations.

   ### HTML Style

   ##### 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

   ### JavaScript Style

   ##### 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

   ### Utilization of es6

   ##### 2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.

   ### Testing

   ##### 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

   ### Workflow

   ##### 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

    #### Feedback to me:

    ###### Kenia is a great team member. Kenia is a clear communicator and is able to convey her ideas in a concise way. She is also a great listener and lets you know you were heard. Amazing organization!!! We were on track from the start. I need her to teach me. Kenia is very personable and easy to like. Teaming up wither her was very easy and comfortable. Kenia is able to incorporate others ideas into the project. At times when I felt behind, Kenia would jump ahead to other things. While this was great for the project and deliverables, it did have the effect of making me feel a bit like a weight on the group. To be fair this was our first project and I did have some catching up to do. In the future, I would suggest taking a little breaks and making sure team members are all up to speed. Our project ran very smoothly because of Kenia's hard work and dedication. I would definitely work with her again and often seek her out for suggestions and assistance. -Franklin Crosby

## Flash-Cards

      ### Enumerable & Collections

      ##### 3- Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

      ### Test-Driven Development

      ##### 3.5- Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

      ### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

      ##### 3- Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

      ### Functional Expectations

      ##### 3- Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 5 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

## Mid-Mod Assessment

      This project was really great because it really drove in object oriented development for me.

      ##### Instructor: Meeka
      ##### Comments:

      * Recommend to continue working on this while pairing.

      * Window management - so you can have the tests below the code and pull up the docs really quickly.

      * I'm pushing you to go in uncomfortable directions with the code - in a work flow that isn't the one you typically like to take.

      * need to be pushed to do the testing first.

      * Feel free to have the testing docs up to remind self of the different expectations available.

      ### Fundamental Javascript & Style

      ##### 2- Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

      ### JavaScript Style

      ##### 3- Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

      ### Workflow

      ##### 2- Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

      ### Collaboration

      ##### 4- Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

        ### Testing

      ##### 3- Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

  #### Feedback to me:
  Working with Kenia was great. She is a team-player and a great collaborator. She is super encouraging and knowledgeable. She was always willing to share any knowledge she has and make sure I was following along before moving on. She has paired with me on projects and numerous times during the mod. She is always a pleasure to work with and has a great way of working through problems! She is always always willing to help or jump in and collaborate. She always teamed up with me to take headshots this mod for our classmates. She's the best! The only are I would say to work on is to have more patience with yourself. I can see you get frustrated with yourself and it causes you to lose focus. Something to be aware of and make sure to step away and take breaks.

  #### Feedback from me:




# B: Professional Development:

###### For all of my projects I used waffle to stay organized and to make sure that we stayed on track throughout. This went really well for all of them because we were able to split up tasks and make sure we dedicated enough time to the tasks we knew would be more challenging.

###### I think I got a lot of valuable feedback and I took away a couple of key point that I think will help me to grow as a developer. Apart from the constructive feedback that I know will only help me to get better, the remainder of the feedback I received was really encouraging.

###### I have already began my cold outreach journey. I have gotten a few replies back, but my goal is to figure out a meaningful way to make connections in Seattle while I'm still here in Denver.

# E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Gear Up

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

###### Everyone deserves a safe place to work and it is really discouraging to think that there are places where women/men do not feel comfortable based on their gender, race etc. I think a safe space is somewhere you can feel valuable and comfortable enough to contribute and fail without being afraid. I personally have felt like there were times where my ideas or thing I wanted to contribute were ignored or pushed aside. I have tried to combat that by letting people know what is going on. I think the reason more women tend to brush things like being overlooked or ignored under the rug is because they are afraid of being "bitchy" or "uptight".

#### Universal income

###### I think that our future economy is in trouble. I’m not sure what the best way to approach new job opportunities is,, but I do agree that maybe this route would be a good one. It was really surprising to read that 46% of the people asked if they supported a base income for every us resident agreed. “The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining.” — Stephen Hawking This quote by stephen hawking really speaks on how we need to think about what jobs are becoming less and less available to people. Slowly, but surely we are moving towards a time where manufacturing jobs will be completely taken over by artificial intelligence. It is easy to brush this off as people wanting easy money for no work especially with the subject we are tackling today, but for those who only have experience in these fields it will become impossible to find any way to stay afloat and live when there is nowhere for them to work. It seems like this would never happen, surely robots can’t  do what humans can, but now that things like the self driving car are becoming more and more precise a whole to of people could lose their transportation jobs. So the question really come to if robots can truly do all of the jobs we were once reliant on to survive. How else will we live other that universal income?



## Giving Feedback

This mod I really wanted to make sure I gave some constructive feedback. I always appreciate an opportunity to grow and I need to get better at making sure I give truthful feedback in a positive way.

#### Feedback I gave:

  ###### Laura, I had a great experience pairing with Laura. She had a good understanding of her code an was able to talk me through the problems that they wanted to fix. It was very easy to jump into her code and follow the logic. She is a great problem solver and it was easy for me to guide her to the answer.  (Laura turk)

  ###### I think during our project we had really great communication and we were able to successfully accomplish all of the requirements thanks to us splitting tasks and checking in with each other. I think we did a great job with our workflow, so it really reflected well on the work we were able to accomplish. We focused on specific tasks and were able to move through them quickly. I think your teamwork was great communication has a huge part in it as well and we were able to talk to each other and make sure we were moving forward in our project. I think being honest and communication are your biggest strengths. We were able to really focus on tasks because of our workflow and our willingness to check in with each other on where we were on the project. I think we all need to make sure we're making as many little commits as possible through github so it's really something everyone should work on. Thanks for being such a great partner! I think you were a great listener and were always willing to listen to new ideas. (Franklin Crosby)

## Playing a Part

  #### This mod I really took it upon myself to help mod 1 as much as could with pairings. It was incredibly helpful to teach someone something I had learned and it helped me become more confident in my knowledge.

  #### Feedback from Pairings:

  ###### Pairing with Kenia was a breakthrough for my partner and I. She did an excellent job walking us through the problem and sharing her knowledge with out directly feeding us the code. After just an hour I left feeling much more comfortable with our project and the concepts that we were learning. I would highly recommend people seek her out for pairing!
  -Laura Turk

  ###### Kenia was prompt and super helpful. She was great at breaking down a complex topic into bite size pieces and Navigating with thoughtful questions as we implemented the idea. Paired with the fact that I had forgotten to message her until 10pm the night before the 8am pairing session she was awesome. 5/5
  -Devon Bull

  ###### I really got a lot out of our pairing session.  You helped me with several issues I was having with my application.  Your instructions were clear and concise and you understood what I was trying to accomplish.  I really appreciate pairing with people who aren't all over my computer typing in stuff, as I am trying to learn.  You gave great instruction for me to navigate my application and make the necessary changes I needed for the outcome I was seeking.   Thank you!
