## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Book Hour

* [Original Assignment]()

Pending

### C: Group Work & Projects


## HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kfarias/headcount2.0)

* [Original Assignment]()

#### Students: Kenia & Pam
#### Evaluator: Brenna

#### Specification Adherence
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality
- 2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

#### CSS/Design
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

#### Testing
- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kfarias/MovieTracker)

* [Original Assignment]()

#### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.


#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## Swapi Box

* [Original Assignment]()

Students: Kenia & Michael

Instructor: Taylor

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### Grit

There were many times where I felt like I wanted to give up here at Turing or like mistakes made during a project were the worst thing that could happen. But after a while I began to realize that If I really want to be a developer and pursue this career that I gave up college for I can’t afford to give up. After some time I started to realize that the mistakes I was making in my projects were only small hurdles to get over and that I would eventually realize my mistake and push forward. It is definitely encouraging to think that grit could be associated with moving forward here at Turing. I think it helps to realize that this is a difficult program to get through and it takes not only determination, but also passion to get through some of the most difficult times here. It does become difficult to keep going when you feel like all you want is to quit, but I find that focusing on what my future will look like if I succeed here is much more encouraging and helps me to push away those feelings and persevere. I already know the feeling of wanting to quit will keep on coming back every once in a while, but knowing that I am pushing myself hard now to hopefully achieve my long term goals overpowers the harships.

The thing that gets me through some of the more stressful and just plain “give-up” moments is a saying from my mom. She always says you have two things stacked against you, being a woman, and being brown, but I know you’re tough and you need to work twice as hard and make sure those two things are irrelevant. If you do that you will be able to accomplish anything. I feel like knowing that hardships in my life would ultimately lead to accomplishing a greater goal helps drive a person forward.

2-3 ways you can imbue your work over the next week and next inning to be more "filled with purpose."

1= To view frustrations as a necessary part of the process. It’s very easy to get tangled up in a problem and feel like there is no way out other that giving up, but to know that you will encounter problems is a good way to stay prepared and get through them more easily in the future. When it comes to developing there are never enough frustrating problems.

2= Initially I would view some of the assignments as a chore, I think a way that made this more meaningful for me was to think that every new assignment I finished was just adding to my overall knowledge and capability to do great in future jobs. Thinking about bigger goals and where I could be when it came to capability and comfort in what I was doing really helped to give meaning to Turing in a whole different way.

#### Artificial Intelligence

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I think that Automation is taking jobs away from people , but that’s  inevitable. i think what we really need to focus on is how to take that information and make sure that the people who don’t really have a choice in the matter need to be taken care of in some way. If we  end up with millions of people being unemployed and only a certain percentage of people who’s jobs haven’t been replaced yet are able to get ahead in life. We  talked about a couple of ways to approach this subject. One idea that was interesting was the thought of universal income being a part of our lives if everything does in fact become automated. We can’t equal employment with livelihood or there will be a huge homeless population, so the idea was the universal income would cover  your necessities food etc. One thing that was brought up was being useful in a society that is already paying for your livelihood. I think in this situation it would be interesting to see what kinds of jobs would come out of that environment and if this system could possibly work. I think the top solution we came away with was education. in order to give people better footing to make sure they can survive in a world where technology is growing at a rate we can’t imagine we need to make sure we are teaching younger generations computer science and giving them the tools to succeed early on. I think Turing doesn’t a great job of reaching people that wouldn’t typically think this was the place for them. I also think we need to make sure we are doing what we can to volunteer some time into helping kids become passionate about technology because it is sure to be in their future.

### Being a Community Member

1. What was your experience working with Kenia?
  I love working with Kenia. She is positive and motivated. I always feel heard and hope she feels the same. I look forward to working with her again soon.

2. What are some areas of improvement?
  I think we could have worked together a little more on our last project however the nature of the work was easier to complete separately.
  -Franklin Crosby

1. What was your experience working with Kenia?
  You were great! At certain points when stress was high, I think you were able to keep a good attitude and sense of humor to ground the group. You are able to think through problems logically and it's apparent how comfortable you are with React and JS fundamentals.

2. What are some areas of improvement?
  Work on testing??
  -Tim

1. What was your experience working with Kenia?
  I had the opportunity to work with Kenia on three different projects during this mod: HeadCount2.0, Ember Island, and Movie Tracker. Throughout the entirety of each project, Kenia was a patient, engaging, and thoughtful partner. It was clear that she was truly invested in both my learning and her own - which I've found is not necessarily a common trait to come across when pairing with others. Her ability to get things done and keep pushing forward is admirable, and I look forward to working with her more in the future.
