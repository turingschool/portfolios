## Areas of Emphasis

  #### For this module I really set out to understand all of the code I was writing and to feel more comfortable collaborating with people and being more vocal. Overall I do believe that I was able to accomplish my goals and I feel much more comfortable discussing ideas and talking through problems in a group setting.

-----------------------

# A: End of Module Assessment


## Progression/Completion

  #### soft 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

## JavaScript Style

  #### soft 3, needs to study foundations hard and maximize practice work/exercises over break. Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

## Workflow

  #### soft 3, needs to rely less on keyboard. Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

## Collaboration

  #### 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process)


# B: Individual Work & Projects

  #### This project really helped to become more comfortable with exploring different styles on my own.

### Personal Site

* https://github.com/kfarias/personal-site
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/personal-site-first-draft.html

  #### This is a site to showcase our personal style and resume. We had a brief review on our sites from the class and instructors and I was told that I needed to maybe add a short bio in my main page to make sure people know who I am. We also had some design mentors come in and talk about our site and he showed me some cool sites that achieve the look that I want to show in my personal site.

# C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

  #### These projects were really great and helped to improve my group work skills and also helped really practice writing out code and implementing all of the skills we learned in our lessons.

## Number Guesser

* https://github.com/kfarias/numberGuesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

  #### This was a game that generated a random number from 1-100 for a user to guess.



## UX/UI Expectations

  #### 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

## Functional Expectations

  #### 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

## Fundamental JavaScript Style

  #### 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

  ## Feedback to me:
  #### Kenia was willing to collaborate, work hard, and also take breaks. I enjoyed working with Kenia. Kenia could be even more aggressive and take charge on a specific element, whether it be css or a challenging javascript function. Kenia is positive and not afraid to make suggestions in the moment. -Adam Rice

  ## Feedback I gave:

  #### Adam thank you for taking on a mentor role and really guiding the project in the right direction. Also, thanks for letting me struggle instead of just giving me the answer right away. It really helped me to become more comfortable with writing out code. I think our project worked out really well because of our initial DTR and our constant communication. I also became a lot more comfortable pushing and pulling changes from and to gitHub. I feel like there were some parts of the project where you had a great idea and went with it, but I would have liked to go over what some of the changes were a little more in depth. I really think our overall teamwork was great and I learned a lot!



## Linked List

* [https://github.com/kfarias/linkList]
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]

  This was a helpful link storage website that used local storage to save data.


## Functional Expectations

  #### 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.

## Fundamental JavaScript Style

  #### 2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

## Workflow

  #### 2.8: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

## HTML Style

  #### 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS Style

  #### 2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

  ## Feedback to me:

  #### Kenia, it was a lot of fun pairing with you on link-list. I cannot believe we did all of that in two days. I like that we incorporate jQuery into our project, and that you were willing to go to pairing sessions as a team. Overall I think we both need to work on our jQuery, but it is a newer concept for us. I appreciate the help with git and github too. I hope we can work together again!

  ## Feedback I gave:

  #### Overall I think our project went well, but I do think we could have done better. I think we did really well at working as a group through the project and even though we had problems with git Hub we figured it out! One thing that I think you could work on is being more verbal while working in a group.  There were times where I felt like you needed to be more assertive with your ideas for the project. Overall I think we worked well and even though we still have a lot of room for growth I was happy with our project.

## Idea Box

* https://github.com/kfarias/idea-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

  #### This was a website that stores ideas in which we also used local storage.


## Notes

  #### JavaScript looked pretty good, but there were some large functions that needed breaking down and refactoring, for sets of variables that are needed within a function, could break these out into a function that returns an object with these variables git workflow was good, but there were some large commits and needed more conversation in the PRs Alignment and width of buttons/input fields was getting off compared to the comp especially when the window size was wide.

## Specification Adherence

  #### 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## HTML Style

  #### 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS Style

  #### 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## JavaScript Style

  #### 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## Workflow

  #### 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Collaboration

  #### 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

  ## Feedback to me:

  #### Great job on the project. I wish I had more to criticize but you really were a great partner. I was especially happy to see you step up to the challenge when I asked you to take the lead on the JS portion of the project even though you were uncomfortable with JS at that time. It showed a lot of determination and grit to willingly tackle something unfamiliar. You also bring a cheerful presence and great attitude to every group you're in. Thanks again for the hard work and you truly made the project fun and enjoyable.

  ## Feedback I gave:

  #### Justin, I was a little nervous to work with you because you are so much more advanced, but after doing our DTR I felt super re-assured that you were willing to go at my speed. I really appreciated that you let me take on a lot of the javascript and took on more of a mentor role and it helped me become much stronger at writing code. One thing I would suggest is taking some time to yourself every once in while. You are very focused and driven, but I do feel like you need to step away and take more breaks. Overall i think we worked really well together and I appreciate your patience. â€”Kenia Farias



## Game Time

* https://github.com/kfarias/Frogger

  #### Built Frogger!


## Functional Expectations:

  #### 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

## User Interface

  #### missing directives on how to play (i.e. am i using my mouse? the arrow keys?)

  #### 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## Testing:

  #### No functionality is tested, presence of functions is covered. needed a refactor of the codebase to make testing more straightforward. got stuck with dealing with canvas + tests.

  #### 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

## JavaScript Style

  #### soft 3, significant amount of working code is in the index.js file. needs to be refactored.

  #### 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow

  #### 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

  #### The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

  #### 3 - Five or fewer complaints

  ## Feedback to me:

  #### Kenia- I had a great time being your partner. You are an incredibly hard worker, and won't stop until a task is complete. Your positivity and kindness make working on a stressful project a lot easier. We worked together extremely well. We both had goals for this project that achieved by working together. You are very talented and I hope to work with you again soon! I am very impressed with how hard you are willing to work, we had a lot of late nights. One piece of constructive criticism, during a really stressful time for me, you took a break and got coffee. It ended up making me even more nervous, and I had even felt abandoned. Next time maybe you could be more aware of the time and Iâ€™ll be sure to voice my concerns to you so that we donâ€™t have this problem again! I think what we accomplished was awesome, and I am super proud of how the game turned out. Being your partner and friend has been such a joy!. â€”Bekah

  ## Feedback I gave:

  #### Bekah, working with you was honestly so much fun. Your positivity made our stressful times through this project seem much less intimidating. I think our game was a huge success and iâ€™m so proud that we made this! I thought that we were both really vocal about how to split up work and I think our collaboration with each other was great. One area of improvement that I saw while working with you would be to make sure you focus on our problems before you help others. For example during one of our merge conflicts I had a game that was not working. Before I could talk to you about the problem you went over to help someone else with their game before I could talk to you and It stressed me out. In the future you can think about being more aware of conflicts in your team and I will work on being more vocal about my concerns.




# D: Professional Skill

## Gear Up
### Politics

  #### Based on the content of the content I just read I would describe the rights and responsibilities of a U.S citizen to be, to serve willingly on a jury when called, to take full advantage of oneâ€™s education, to stay ready to defend the willingness to serve when called , to preserve and conserve the public parks and lands, to be self supporting as possible, to pay your taxes, to offer informed and constructive criticism and to uphold the freedom of speech of others, stand for the rights and opportunities of others, train yourself in the Some qualities I believe a leader should posses are relatable, driven, reliable, and ultimately a great decision maker. People who are concerned about all citizens regardless of their race, gender, and sexual identity are also important leaders. When personal bias is thrown into the mix it makes for splits in groups and possible violence.I look for a person who is ready to make important decision and I do. This election is definitely going to be a choice of picking the lesser evil. I believe that the reason fir this is that the people who are actually qualified for this position are being butted out by those with more influence and wealth. No, I love participating in my community and being an active member, but running for office has never been a goal of mine. Probably, politics are important and i believe people do want to participate in their communities, but i also feel like itâ€™s an intimidating place to be.There are many ways to participate and be a part of these decisions, so I would probably make sure that


# E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback


### Being a Community Member

  #### Feedback to me: Kenia - Although we didnâ€™t work directly this module, Iâ€™ve had enough experience with you to know that you are a hard worker and have come a long way since the beginning weeks of this program. I know it took a lot of courage to leave school at MSU and start over with little experience in coding, but your skills have proved that this is the right career choice for you. Iâ€™m so proud of you as your friend as well as a fellow Turing student.

  #### Feedback from me: Lauren, while I didnâ€™t have the opportunity to partner with you in this mod there were many times where we paired and helped each other out. I am really happy that we are in this program together. Itâ€™s always nice to have someone who is also starting from scratch that you can relate to. There have been a couple of times where I have been really stuck on something and you are always more than willing to help me through it. You are an amazing addition to our class and am excited to work with you in a future project!

## Playing a Part

  #### I was really exited to hear about the posses here at Turing and have been a proud member of the Verou posse! I also think that all of our community days are important and have helped me grow in verbalizing my thoughts. I am always wanting to hear what people out in the field are doing and have attended most of the Friday speakers!
