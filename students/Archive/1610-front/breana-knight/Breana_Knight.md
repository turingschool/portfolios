-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Breana has shown quite a bit of progress from the mock assessment. We've discussed, and it would be worthwhile for her to repeat mod-1 to solidify some fundamentals before moving forward in the program.
 * Progression/Completion

 * 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
JavaScript Style

 * 2.5: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
Workflow

 * 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

 * 2.8: Collaboration Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Game-Time: Frogger )

* [https://github.com/ejwill04/frogger

* [The original assignment was to choose between several game concepts and build it over a two week period]()

(The game "Frogger" was created. A user controls a frog with a cursor navigating the frog through obstacles. The levels increase intensity as the user advances.)

 (Game-Time: Frogger:
 User Interface: 4
 Testing: 4
 Javascript Style: 3
 Work-Flow: 3
 Code Sanitation: 4)

(The most important comment revolved around refactoring the code and to even out the git commits between machines. An example of the code refactor would be setting the collision detection formula to a variable rather than rewriting every-time we needed the function.)

#### (IdeaBox)

* [https://github.com/AKewlBreeze/IdeaBox]()
* [The original assignment was to follow the given prompt and build out an application to store and retrieve ideas]()

(The project allows a user to input and retrieve thoughts that they write. Requiring collaboration with local storage and a higher degree of CSS styling)

(evaluation comments)

(Specification Adherence: 3
HTML Style: 3.5
CSS Style: 3
JavaScript Style: 3
Workflow: 3
Collaboration: 3)

(Code organization in CSS is something that requires your time when creating projects. Establishing a good channel for communication with a partner and adjusting it as the project moves along can make or a break a project.)

#### (Project Name)

* [https://github.com/sljohnson32/Linked-List]()
* [Linked_List is an application for users to bookmark sites]()

(The application allows users to store their bookmarks. Requiring, appending or prepending to a page and interpolation)

(Functional Expectations: 4
JavaScript Style: 3
Workflow: 2
HTML Style: 3
CSS: 3)

#### (Number-Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jonwille/Number-Guesser
)
* [A small game where a user guesses a number]()

(The user is required to input a number. The application will tell the person if they guessed the correct number, or if they were too high, or too low.)

(Our UI/UX was lacking tremendously, a better workflow could have helped this.)

(UX/UI: 2
Functional Expectations: 2
JavaScript Style: 3
)

(To take the time to get help when needed, rather than spending too much time figuring out something I'm stuck on.)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up Recap

* All of the gear ups I considered to be important aspects of our daily affairs. We started with voting, and I think it served well to have people delve into their civic responsibilities. Of course to get people thinking about the presidential election and it’s importance. The extroverts and introvert discussion came at an important time as were starting to work in group projects more regularly and to hear opposing opinions was also a nice reminder on how to work with others. The resilience discussion was too of great importance.  It was great to have this lesson to serve as a reminder to keep pushing.  All the lessons were well picked and pertained to different aspects of the turing experience. What I have taken away is to keep on when it’s hard, when it’s different, and when it’s right.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(
This was a wonderful learning experience. I appreciated the care and concern you provided as we worked through the project. Taking the time to explain complicated theories. I felt comfortable interjecting my thoughts, opinions, and code snippets. I greatly admire your work ethic. I would hope to work with you again in the future.


IdeaBox was a tremendous challenge and we had some setbacks but we got the project together and it was a solid project. I probably learned the most on that project. I felt like this project was an equally shared between the two of us. That provided a wonderful learning opportunity. You had a pleasant attitude through some difficult stuff, and were open to my suggestions. It was a great experience for me.


Sam: Linked list was a great learning experience and I appreciated having the opportunity to work with someone who worked similarly to mine. The short amount time allotted on the project was a stressful experience and I was pleased to be able to work with someone who was level headed and stay focused through the stress. I appreciated your help and time throughout the process.  


Jon: The work that you did was much appreciated. We were able to scrape together at the end to get what we needed. Number guesser was our first project and because of that there were a number of ambiguities with our knowledge and facts of the project. It wasn’t ideal but I thought it was a great that we had these discrepancies as I think they will be very helpful with organizing and planning future projects. We had some setbacks, but you had a good attitude, and we  got it done. I enjoyed working with you. )

### Being a Community Member

(Self: I was far too concerned with understanding everything but I felt good about actually typing something. I now realize that it is possible to begin to understand things while I’m typing. I was in a traditional school pursuing advanced degrees and I took a very traditional approach to Turing. Lecture, read, study and then try to implement. At Turing I need to implement immediately and not wait too long before I try to do it myself. Turing so far has been far more enjoyable than being in college and far more difficult in some regards, and therefore the approach needs to be different. There is help available and I need to take more advantage of the offerings. And realizing if there is something to really speak up about it. It’s not college where one has to file petitions, and meet with advisors before someone will seriously consider a request. I need to get that out of my head and do more and contemplate less.


Elijah: Game-Time:  I really enjoyed working with you on game-time.  I love how inquisitive you are and how that translates as a partner.  I also greatly appreciated your positive spirit throughout the project.  The area I would challenge you in is to constantly be reviewing and rebuilding your code.  I think as you build that repetition into your work style, you’ll find that the logic and syntax will begin coming more easily.  Keep up the awesome work!  I can’t wait to continue working with you in future mods!


Stephanie: IdeaBox: I learned so much from working on IdeaBox with you.  I appreciated your thoughtful approach to the code.  I also appreciated your flexibility, understanding, and hospitality when it came to scheduling meeting times.  Also, I was impressed with how resourceful you were.  Several times when we were stuck, you would reference the relevant lessons or reach out to others to make sure you had all the information necessary. Also, your organizational skills with creating and closing github issues were helpful to guide our process at the end.  For constructive, I think it would have been helpful for both of us if we did a DTR reassessment or something similar prior to our pairing with Bree and maybe even after.  I think we both worked to try and meet each other’s communication styles but didn’t really know the best way to go about it.  Hence, more reflection on how to work together effectively throughout the process might have benefited us both.


Sam: Linked-List: - Given the time constraint on this project, I appreciated your flexibility and desire to dig into the project as soon a we got it.
- I really respected your push to pair with your mentor on parts of this project.  It gave me more motivation to do the same!
- The constructive criticism I have - and this is a very minor point - is that I think you should be more proactive in reaching out if you are having a problem with a line of code and wanted to pair on it.  I know we didn’t have much time - really only two nights - but figured I’d just mention it as something to consider moving forward on partner projects!


John: Number Guesser: It was an absolute pleasure working with you on number-guesser. I appreciate you helping me with the css, I felt like that is my weakness and you stepped up. Us not being able to use git and github definitely made the project harder for us. I also liked that you were willing to get pairing sessions with me as well. Overall I think we work really well together and hope we can work together on a future project!
