# Mike Limberg - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My mantra in Mod 2 was to say yes to helping anyone who asked for help on a problem. Additionally I worked to pair with as many Mod 1'ers as possible so that I can build on my foundational skills and get better at explaining code. Lastly, I set out to continuously improve upon my vanilla javascript by teaming up with fellow Mod 2 students for a daily study group.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/mlimberg/weathrly)

The goal of this project is to get practice pulling in data with an API (designed by Jhun). Weatherly was a great opportunity to try out React solo. I enjoyed the ability to move at my own pace.

######Feedback:
* Break out lengthy chunks of code to be more readable
* scan a render function and know what’s being put on the page
* Render function is clear and readable
* AJAX call could be its own function in its own file
* The more you can refactor the more you can unit test
* Try (guessing this was an unfinished thought, but try nonetheless)

*Not Graded*

#### Number Guesser in React

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/number-guesser-react)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

The goal of this project is to help you practice for your assessment. This project should seem somewhat familiar with the added twist that you’ll be doing it in React.

**Instructor:** Jhun

There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

######HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

######JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

######Utilization of es6

* 3.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

######Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

######Workflow

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### MicroAggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Great to hear a mix of perspectives on what a microagression is and how to deal with them.

####Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Didn't find this one to be as valuable. Might have found it more valuable to do journey mapping as it relates to code.

####Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Great gear up. Very cool to think about how passion plays a part in coding and start to really find coding FUN.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Cold Outreach

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)

As someone who used to do door-to-door sales, cold emailing is not a problem.

#### Networking

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)

Coming from the Marketing world, this is second nature. I find myself almost always networking regardless if I am currently seeking an opportunity. Definitely enjoy meeting new people on a regular basis. Great to meet our fellow Mod 2 cohort as well.


#### Agile

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)

Not the most effective session but good to get a taste of what it will likely look like to organize teamwork and projects in the professional world.

#### Johari-Window

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)

Fun and interesting activity, though I wish there would have been more critical terminology to include. Perhaps there's a way to make it anonymous with computers so no one has to feel bad about submitting a critical term. Also, limit the terms. Perhaps 5 happy terms and 5 critical terms.

#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)

Nice to have a central place to keep information on the companies I'm looking at. I'm sure the list will change quickly from my initial list but a good practice nonetheless.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**To Hugh on Pairing**

Hugh seems to have a great grasp on the concepts taught in Mod 1. When pairing with him he is able to clearly communicate what’s happening in his code using mostly accurate terminology. He always asks great questions and clearly has a desire to continue to grow in his programming abilities. I look forward to future pairing sessions!

**To Anna on Fire Bae**

Anna is great to work with! She's a hard worker, open communicator and asks great questions. She's not afraid to say when she doesn't know something and seeks to understand the answer as well as the process to get to it. Would gladly work with her again. Keep practicing. Keep pushing!

**To Andy on Fire Bae**

Andy brings a lot of energy to the team. He’s thorough in his approach to understanding a problem and is always willing to team up and tackle a problem.

With the shortened timeline of the project, I would liked to have see more communication from Andy. None of us stuck to the routine we tried to set for communication during our DTR, however with a lot of remote work time Andy’s updates were sparse including no communication on Friday.

My advice would be to speak up more. Whether you’re stuck on something, busy with life stuff, sick, etc. your team will always appreciate an update on what is/isn’t/will be worked on by you that day.

Ultimately, I think Andy has an incredible drive to learn this stuff and I recommend he continue to practice and ask questions.

**To Bekah on Shoot the Breeze**

It was great working with Bekah on the Shoot the Breeze project! Aside from being from the land of 10,000 lakes (which makes her awesome by default), Bekah is a hard worker, easy to communicate with and constantly working to better understand the confusing concepts we are learning.

All things considered I thought the project couldn’t have gone smoother. We made a pretty straight forward plan, built it out piece by piece and came out of it with a good-looking and functioning application. And, I felt we were both able to elevate our skills along the way, learning the nuances of Firebase, React and good old fashioned vanilla JS.

My only advice would be to be ok with, nay, embrace the unknown. Be ok with not knowing something and use it as fuel to figure it out. You’re very smart. Don’t let the fear of looking or feeling “dumb” prevent you from asking questions and striving to learn more.

I think this project might be the best I’ve been a part of so far and look forward to the opportunity to work with Bekah again. Thanks for being a solid teammate!

**To Lauren on 2DoBox**

I thoroughly enjoyed working with Lauren on 2DoBox. Lauren brings a positive energy to the group and made the first project in Mod 2 a success! She’s approachable, made herself available and was not afraid to speak up when she had an idea on a problem. We were able to agree on things easily and effectively as a team and due to her willingness to work after school and on the weekend, the project ran smoothly from beginning to end. It was a solid team effort!

The only advice I can give is to keep at the code. Practice, ask questions and continue to learn more. From a collaboration standpoint, you’re all set! I’d welcome the opportunity to work with Lauren again on a project. Thanks for helping to kick mod 2 off right!

### Project Teammate Feedback

**From Andy on Fire Bae**

Mike is a power-house. He charges into the project with alacrity and confidence. At any time I could ask him for help. In fact, my biggest regret is that I didn’t engage early & often.
Mike demonstrates great patience and a natural ability to explain complex ideas with clarity and honesty. I see Mike as a leader, and it was a pleasure to work with him.
As far as critique goes, I *can not* honestly ask that he act or conduct himself any better than he had. When I was lost or confused, he was patient to stop and explain. If I was routinely lost, he made every effort to ask if I knew what was going on. If I faltered in communicating he (most certainly) picked up the slack. Mike is a model to work towards for me. I mean that sincerely, though he may say my admiration is _too_ generous, I would have to stubbornly disagree. I hope I didn’t let him down, because Mike, in my opinion, deserves to work with people who are as engaged and capably as he. As long has he keeps doing what he’s doing he will be an _invaluable_ asset to his team and his cause. Thanks for being you Mike.

**From Anna on Fire Bae**

Mike is an excellent partner. He communicates well and clearly, and does his utmost to make sure everyone on the team understands before moving on. He does not hesitate to take on the hardest tasks, but encourages his teammates to take them and push themselves if they want to. He is always willing to help. Sometimes, I think he takes on too much himself, but I think that if he was in a stronger group or every member of the team pulled their weight equally, it would not have been a problem. I would gladly work with Mike again.

**From Bekah on Shoot the Breeze**

I worked on Shoot the Breeze with Mike. Mike was an awesome partner to have on a really intense project. He is an extremely hard worker, sets his goals high, and won’t stop until he gets the product he wants. His passion for this program shows every step of the way.

Mike took a lot of time making sure that I felt comfortable with our code. If I wasn’t understanding something, he would go out of his way and sit down with me, teaching me until I understood. Mike cared about my well-being and how I was doing with things. This took a lot of stress off of me and made my time much easier, as well as making the project more enjoyable. I believe that he helped my confidence with React and made me a better developer.

The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is about taking time for yourself and taking breaks from the projects. I know you would often go home an code all night, and I think you need to make sure that you take time off and breathe a little!

The project we worked on together turned out great, and I believe we both learned a lot.  Thank you so much for being such an awesome partner!

I really couldn’t think of good constructive criticism, I seriously think you were an awesome partner, thank you.

**From Lauren on 2DoBox**

 I thoroughly enjoyed working with Mike on our first project for module 2. Mike is incredibly dedicated, spending many late nights on our project fix problems or perfect parts of our code. He always has a positive attitude and was willing to listen to my own ideas or thoughts. Mike works extremely hard and it shows through his code. My only advice (and I really had to take some time to come up with something) is to not to worry about giving your partner more responsibility! You take on a lot and deserve some downtime if you need it. Thanks for being an awesome partner to kick off mod 2 Mike!


### Being a Community Member

**From Staci (Mod 1) On Pairing**

I really enjoyed pairing with you multiple times Mike. You didn't hold my hand and really made me think about things and talk out loud which was extremely helpful to me. You also took the time to whiteboard out things we were struggling with during our pairing for game time. You really know your stuff and I always feel like I come away learning a lot when working with you. One thing would be to possibly slow down a bit, I can tell you get really excited and love that but sometimes I struggle to keep up with how fast your brain is firing! I appreciate all the times you've worked with me and continue to hope to pair with you in the future!

**From Marissa on Pairing**

Working with Mike was really great. He never just gave me an answer, but always found a way to help be more of a guide to get me closer to the solution.

**From Chelle**

Mike has been an integral component in my learning during Mod 2 here at Turing.  His ability to grasp difficult concepts and then translate the material into something I comprehend is unsurpassed.  His patience and kindness are catalysts in this learning process.  Thank you so much, Mike, for going above and beyond.  I credit you for my thorough understanding of the curriculum, that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to wrap my head around.

**From Anonymous**

I appreciate your willingness to help guide us to the answers we are seeking as opposed to just handing us the answers - which I think is rare. You are flexible in the way you explain concepts, which is very helpful for people with different learning styles.

**From Hugh (Mod 1) on Pairing**

Thank you for your openness and general good vibes. I appreciate you taking the time to help. Your advice surrounding collision detection in breakout was tremendously helpful for making our game less glitchy. I really like the way in which you are able to reduce seemingly complex concepts to easily comprehensible bits. I look forward to pairing with you next mod!

### Playing a Part

I tried to clean a bit more even on days that weren't assigned to me, push in chairs when I was one of the last to leave etc. Other than that I really just try to help people when they bump into problems. Being at Gusto it's mainly just Mod 1 but I like to offer help whenever I can. I opened up an hour pairing slot every day except Friday for the entire module.

[ Note from Meeka: started leading fundamental JavaScript practices in the morning ]

### Personal Reflection

I worked really hard to improve myself as a teammate and learner this mod, mostly based on the feedback and impressions I got from teammates in mod 1. One of the biggest things I knew I had to work on was my patience and temperment when running into hurdles during a project.

The introvert/extrovert and resiliance gear ups were surprisingly helpful in overcoming some of the tendencies I had developed in the early stages of Mod 1. I thought I was a good communicator and understood the importance of communication already, but am learning more and more how different people are and how much communication matters when trying to collaborate on a deliverable. Additionally, I've



### Project Management

Quite honestly this area needs improvement. The individual assigned to the role of Project Manager on our last project did not implement any sort of tracking. I've used Waffle succesfully on two projects but do not remember to update it regularily enough.
