# Mike Limberg - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At first, I set out to find a job before the end of Turing, but after the first week loaded full of worthwhile lessons, my focus shifted to absorbing as much as possible to be equipped to hit the ground running on the job search immediately after finishing school.

(Intro)

#### BYOBackend

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/BYOBackend)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

This project focused solely on building a well tested node/express API using fake data that would later be a contributing piece to the larger capstone project. This project required a minimum 17 endpoints, specific methods and all had to be tested for happy and sad paths.

### Projects

#### Jet Fuel

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/jetFuel)

JetFuel is a URL "shortener" service that utilizes a node/express server to store urls and their "shortened" counterpart. Then, when a user pastes the shortened URL in the URL bar, it should direct to its related website.

#### Snip-it (Imposter Syndrome)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)
*  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/snip-it)

Snip-it is a desktop application built using Electron. The app allows users to initiate their draggable screenshot tool, capture a screenshot, name it, designate an optional folder and save it to their desktop in a Snip-it folder. Future renditions would allow the user to add markup to the image.

Points: 118/150

#### Capstone - Future Grooves

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanGrund/futureGrooves)

Future Grooves is the future of grooves. It's a digital audio workstation on the web that allows users to customize and save sounds, customize and save compositions and share/explore compotions with/from other users. The project scope was much larger than 2 weeks could accomodate but we were able to build a serviceable MVP using React, Redux, Express, Knex and a Postgres DB.

Final Score: 280 / 325

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/tree/master/m4_sessions/automation)

This mod we got to lead the automation gear up. It ended up being a great session with a lot of group participation. Similar to when we did the gear up, most participants left with more questions than answers. Great discussions all around. Great gear up. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### Iron-FE

This Mod I helped to divvy up the Iron-FE sessions so that they could continue on after 1608. We gave 4 different people a day of the week to lead including a Mod 3 student. There was no plan as to what was led that day, the owner of that day was just responsible for coming prepared with problems. 

During this time, I was able to connect with mod 2 and help them with understanding on fundamentals with objects, arrays and traversing the two.
