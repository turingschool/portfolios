## A: End of Module Assessment
PASS

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Walker Texas Ranger-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/chuck-norris)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

Walker Texas Ranger-Box was an opportunity to work with an external API and reinforce both React and router skills

**Comments:**

* Good work on the design spec and was able to get many of the features in, including styling the toggle of the controls setting. Testing was limited but had great questions about how to improve there and had a good understanding of what problems he was facing, which made it easy to discuss next steps for getting past those hurdles. Some areas where code could be refactored to reduce duplication, but overall very solid use of React and easily readable code.


######Specification Adherence:

* 4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

######Code Quality

* 3.5 - Developer demonstrated solid understanding of React, with some minimal opportunities for refactoring.

######Design

* 4 - Developer aligned design completely with provided comps. Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

######Testing

* 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Ripe Tomatoes (Movie Reviewer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JeffBuss/movie-watcher)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

Group project to learn Redux. This project had an added back-end component involving an internal api linked to a node database built by the instructor.

**Comments:**

* Full spec adherance and put a lot of thought into usability/implementation. Solid effort getting tests in, though it's still a struggle all around for the mod. Redux was well integrated into the React components.

######Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

######Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

######Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

######JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

######Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

######Workflow

* 4: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.



#### remEMBER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/1610-remember-5)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

Partner project done in Ember. A chance to learn a new framework and improve upon our git skills. Project required resolving step-by-step issues from the instructors. 

**Comments:**

* Passed



#### PERSONAL PROJECT

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mlimberg/Bracket-Builder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

A bracket building app built with React/Redux that allows the user to set up a custom tournament, play out the bracket and have all users see the updates. Incorporates a firebase backend. 

**Comments:**

* TBD

######Specification Adherence

* TBD



## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Very interesting discussion. Really helps combat the excuse that "I'm just one person, I can't make any real changes". Definitely adds a new perspective that bias starts at an individual level and will only be defeated by starting at the individual level.

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

* Very interesting videos and discussions. Somewhat validated the move to learn programming but raises concern for the masses considering the amount of jobs in transportation that could be replaced ubruptly once cars start driving themselves. However, humankind has always had to respond to the changes and problems we create for ourselves. Hopefully we can continue to do so. 

#### [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

#####How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?

* If jobs are decline at a rapid rate, so does spending, and I believe it would be a domino effect from there. Our biggest opportunity is to have a plan for these situations. How can we support communities where rapid job elimination exists with some sort of monetary support, training, etc.?

#####What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?

* It adds credibility. He has potentially some of the greatest insights into the future of technology and therefore understands the level at which jobs could be replaced in the not-so-distant future.

#####Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?

* UBI is essentially a financial support system for communities/nations alike when jobs no longer exist to support the masses. If masses of jobs are replaced by automation/robots, not only are those who lose their jobs affected, but the economy as a whole is affected because people spend less, perhaps crime goes up alongside financial hardships, and it dominos from there.

#####Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

* Yes, we need to be informed, and perhaps ask ourselves the question of what would we do tomorrow if we couldn't find a job because robots took them all. It should be a reason to diversify your skillsets to ensure you can adapt accordingly.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### MeetUps
* [Workshop URL](link)

**Event 1: Bash Scripting in Webpack & Sharing Code with React Native 1/17 at CrownPeak**

This event featured two presentations:
  * The first was by a fellow student Graham Nesser regarding some bash scripts he had written to help configure new react projects more efficiently based on the configuration he’s used to

  * The second was by 2 gentleman from Craftsy , who walked through some examples on how 90% of their code is shared between their iOS, android and web applications. A pretty in-depth refactor/undertaking that has saved them loads of time, money and resources a year+ later.  

**Event 2: DenverScript at Code Talent 1/24/17**

This event featured two presentations as well:
  * First was a talk by two guys who publish a node-module to NPM. They walked us through their rigorous testing as well as showed us how simple deploying to something like NPM is. They even deployed a live update in-front of us (to their ReadMe).

  * The second was a talk by a freelance programmer who dove deep into React testing. He didn’t have experience with Enzyme but has a very thorough understanding of testing React. Got his email and plan to connect at some point as he mentioned he occasionally needs support on projects that come in.

#### M4 Action Plan

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**To Buss on Ripe Tomatoes**

Working with Buss (and Justin) on the movie project was definitely one of the best if not the best group project I’ve had. We had a great workflow, everyone chipped in and I’m very proud of the final product. Buss is a great team player and seeks to contribute wherever and however he can.

I have some guilt however as it felt like Buss become lost on Redux, quickly assumed the roll of “SassGod” and devoted most of his time to making our project look great, therefore missing out on a lot of redux experience that would have been good for him heading into the personal projects. The project looked amazing. But I would encourage Buss to push himself towards areas of uncertainty and ask more questions. I don’t think Justin and I opened as many avenues to help you as we should have, but try to push past ppl like us and demand answers.

Will obviously work with Buss any time. Great team player!

**To Justin on Ripe Tomatoes**

Justin is an excellent partner to have on a project and a crafty programmer. He puts in crazy hours and contributed more than I've ever had a partner contribute on a project. His availability and determination to break down barriers will serve him well in the future. 

My feedback to him would accept seeking guidance after struggling for a while. Some problems aren't worth the amount of time you're willing to spend on them. Additionally, to try to talk about problems with teammates before touching the keys. I know that's how Justin learns, by doing, but it will be good practice for the real world if you learn to talk out solutions before ever typing any code. 

I look forward to working with Justin again. He definitely pushed more than a partner has yet. 

**To Sam on remEMBER**

Working with Sam on the Ember project was great. Tackling foreign concepts with a hard worker and great problem solver was a good experience and made the project fly by almost too easily. Sam made himself available to pair often and was easy to communicate with about code.

One piece of advice is practice patience. I'm guilty of it as well but at times Sam was quick to smash out a potential solution on the keys when it would have probably better served us to stop and talk about the approach before putting "pen to the paper".  

Overall a solid programmer and would gladly work with him again. Hopefully next time on a more exciting project.

**To myself**

Turn down the suck!


### Project Teammate Feedback

**From Sam on remEMBER**

I really enjoyed working with you on the Ember project, Mike.  It was one of the more difficult projects to figure out - in terms of my learning curve - but I thought we had a good pairing dynamic that got us through it very effectively.  I think we were both frustrated at times but think we had a mutual understanding/respect that kept us ultimately on track and able to kick out a very solid project.

My only constructive feedback is actually similar to yours - just to be aware of ideas/a different direction than the one you are on when driving pair coding. I think we are similar in this way - we learn by exploring - but figured I’d mention it since there were a few times where I didn’t feel like you were totally internalizing the idea/direction I was trying to propose.  

I would gladly partner up with you again and hope we get that opportunity on a more substantial project in Mod4.  You are a great programmer and teammate.

**From Justin on Rotten Tomatoes**

Mike is easily one of the most driven individuals in our cohort.  His focus and determination were huge assets while working on our movie tracker redux project. Additionally, he’s exclusively been the only person to be a catalyst in my learning here at Turing. Mike's professionalism and hardwork helped produce a project that I'm proud of. I would happily work with him again and hope to in the future.

**From Buss on Rotten Tomatoes**

Was so excited to see I was paired with you yet again Limbo. Working with you is not only a breeze due to your in-depth understanding of the material, but just b/c you're an overall great guy to be around. I know I definitely grilled you a bit on your moments of negativity the first time around, and that was basically gone. There were a couple instances where it popped up, but was nothing that even came close to causing an issue. Sometimes your backend devs write some shit that's broken lol :)

It's been remarkable watching you progress through this program. If I had to pick a person who I saw make the most progress since day one, it would undoubtedly be you. Your dedication to your work here at Turing is pretty baffling at times. I thought I had strong work ethic, but you make me look like a chump. Look forward to many more long hours at the keyboard followed up by cold beers in the future my man, always a pleasure!

### Community Member Feedback

**From Staci in Mod 2**

What can I say..Mike is the best!!! He is very patient and available and has helped me many times this Mod. I can see a lot of improvement in how he pairs in terms of going slower and making sure everyone or just me is following along. He has held a few 'smikes' as we like to call them. He comes into our classroom and helps to clarify something we were all having trouble with that week. Mike seriously your the reason why I understand reduce!! I would love to give you some constructive feedback but I did last mod and see a huge improvement so I can't say I have any. It's always a pleasure working with you and you never make me feel as though I am bothering you. Your informational and encouraging and I appreciate all you do!

**From Julian in Mod 2**

Your Mike Spike was great, you basically went through the lesson before we actually had it. I wouldn't have understood anything without it.

**From Pamela in Mod 2**

I have come to Mike for help on a number of occasions since becoming a student at Turing. Most recently, I attended a "Mike Spike" where Mike went over array prototypes with some Mod2 students. Mike's ability to explain complex topics in easy-to-understand terms is, without exaggeration, phenomenal. After a 40 minute "Mike Spike," I walked away with a much deeper understanding of array prototypes. I think this is due to two things: Mike's deep understanding of the material that we are covering AND his ability to re-phrase ideas in other ways when people don't understand things the first (or second) time around.

### Being a Community Member


#### Playing a Part

This mod I was an SAB rep for our cohort. My main responsibilities were submitting facilities requests, disseminating information back to our group, and leading group retros. It was a great experience but not one I will continue with. A lot of the frustrations addressed in retro were not ones I could empathize with and so I believe another member of our cohort will do a better job steering guiding each week's conversation. 

#### Personal Reflection

I've had a few moments this mod where I feel like a real developer. My attempt to turn any obstace into an opportunity to grow is working, and helping me better develop my skills. The stress of the job search is sinking in, but with ever new problem I encounter and solve, I feel more confident that I will be able to find position reasonably quick after graduation.
