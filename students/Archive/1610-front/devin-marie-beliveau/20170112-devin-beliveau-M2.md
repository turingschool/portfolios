# Devin Beliveau - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

React. I really wanted to have a better understanding of Enzyme than I do. I guess I expected testing to be a bigger part of this mod. It really comes down to timing. I think because every project is meant to be a crunch to finish on time, testing is a thing that gets shoved to the side until it’s absolutely needed so we don’t learn as much as we should about it. 

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how *YOU* would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5 (I really enjoyed drinking beer and coding by myself)
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Development**: soft 3 (as an introvert I hate reaching out to people I don’t know and I didn’t work on my site at all. But why would we work on our site until the mod is over and we can redo it in React?)
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
##Scrabble Scorer
I liked that we had to do a thing before we did the thing. I like that a small testing suite was involved. I enjoyed the eval and the task we had to complete, but I felt that the majority of the mod was spent learning React and the end of mod test didn’t really deal with components and props. I would have liked it to address React structure and passing things around as props as well. A half hour is a short amount of time though, so I see why it was the way it was.

## D: Professional Development
We have to send seven cold outreach emails. I sent a few cold emails and a few warm emails. I haven’t heard back from any of the cold emails. I have connections with people at companies I’m interested in and would rather work on nurturing those relationships.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Cold Outreach
We spent time writing a draft of a cold outreach email and got feedback from it. I found this useful. It was nice to see how other people went about starting a conversation with someone they don’t know. We’ve been told that these emails may not get us our first job, but will be helpful in getting our second and third jobs. Making connections in the dev world is always helpful as it’s a strong community of people who want to help other devs.

#### Networking
We spent time making an elevator pitch for ourselves to use at networking events. I’m excited to go to networking events in Denver. I think after I go to a few, mixing and interacting with people will become more comfortable.

#### Management Strategies

We used more waffle boards this mod which was great. They’re not a hard thing to set up and use, but it’s just not habit for a lot of us, so it was nice to get into the practice of it. I know we’re all supposed to try really hard to give each other usable feedback, but I really enjoyed working with all my partners and can’t really say much on how I changed the way I work in a team based on feedback. I know I always can do a better job at communicating in the moment and writing better commit messages / comments. I think in general, everyone’s workflow improved greatly this mod. We all tried really hard to write clear messages and make sure we commented on PRs and went through the steps of what it would be like on a team working separately not just a team sitting right next to each other all the time that knows exactly what every PR is for because we did it together. 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback (feedback from me)
Adam Rice: I really liked working on the 2DoBox project with you. I think you're really good at staying calm when things break and I can tell you really like to think through a problem before you try and implement it. We had originally planned to do a lot of the work together, but we ended up working on different parts of the project and combining our efforts to get it done. I actually think this worked out really well, especially since we did have a few opportunities to work together to solve some smaller problems and bugs.

Justin Wood: It was great getting to work with you on Weatherly. I really enjoyed the fact that we were both on the same page in regards to wanting to take time to ourselves and simply learn as much as we could about React before we tried to dive into the project. It was a little stressful not starting the project right away, but in the end, I think we made the right decision by researching before we tried to code. A lot of people in past mods complained about the Weatherly project, but I think we did a good job and I feel like we both learned a lot.

Sam Johnson: It was really fun getting to work with you on our Shoot the Breeze project. We both like working and researching alone and coming together when we needed to, which for this project worked out well. You definitely understood React better than I did at the start and I appreciate that you always made sure to explain everything you did until it made sense to me. This project really hammered home a lot of the React logic for me and as soon as I started doing my Number Guesser project, I found myself remembering and using similar logic from Shoot the Breeze and it was all thanks to you!
Hugh Morrison: It was really fun getting to partner with you on your mod1 projects. I could definitely tell you had a good understanding of concepts and logic in JavaScript. Because my partner and I made breakout in mod1, it was interesting getting to work with you and Michael on your breakout game and see how you went about applying logic. I'm glad I could help, but it's clear you have a good understanding of what's going on. I'd be happy to partner with you again on your upcoming React projects! And as a general piece of feedback, all of us in 1610 were very happy to see you all start to be more vocal on Slack by the middle of the mod. Communication is key!

Kenia Farias: I really enjoyed working with you on our budget app. I think we both felt a little uneasy with one of our partners missing almost a whole week of class, but we managed to stay calm and come up with a plan that worked for us. While we struggled with Firebase the first few days, it was a good learning experience for both of us. I think it's safe to say we both struggle a little with reading docs and feeling comfortable with understanding exactly what they're trying to tell us, but it all comes with practice and we certainly got a lot of it with this project! I really appreciate you were honest about some things you were a little confused about with React at the beginning and I definitely saw during the project that you understand React and how everything comes together and interacts. Don't let dumb Firebase make you doubt your skills!

Eric Sayler: It was great working with you on our Firebase budget app. In fact, it's safe to say that your ability to understand Firebase docs really quickly let us move forward at a pace that allowed us to have a pretty sweet MVP (while helping other teams figure out Firebase too). One thing that I really like about the way you work is that you really try and make sure that the people you work with understand what's happening and why. I think we were all team players on this project and we did a really good job at staying calm under the pressure of the time crunch. My only piece of feedback is your communication at the beginning of this project. You should let your partners know if you're going to be absent so we don't drastically jump to the conclusion that you're dead!

### Being a Community Member (feedback to me)

Adam Rice: Working with Devin on 2DoBox was a good experience. Devin was not afraid to make suggestions when pairing, take on difficult tasks solo when we decided to divide-and-conquer, and she was willing to ask for help from instructors and her mentor in times of crisis. I feel that Devin could benefit by taking short breaks every 20-30 minutes when working, as it seems she will power through several hours with no breaks. This made me as her partner feel pressured to not take breaks as often. Also, towards the end of the deadline I felt that Devin and myself did not do a good enough job communicating the improvements we would make on commits and the work would not be double checked before being merged. Over the course of the week-long project I was happy to learn that Devin is very patient, logical, modest about her abilities, and passionate about solving difficult problems.

Sam Johnson: I thought you were a great partner on this project and I appreciate all the work you put in.  I felt like this was a really “big” project for us - doing a lot of stuff that was new/crazy - and I thought you were really good at partnering with me to make sure we were breaking stuff down into pieces and getting everything done.

Kenia Farias: Devin, working with you on our app was a great experience. I think we had top-notch team work and did a really good job of communicating throughout our project and solidifying our workflow. You did an amazing job as a project manager and really made sure that we had some real goals to reach during our project. I also really appreciate that you were willing to go over some of the React things I was not entirely comfortable in. I think we both learned a lot about Firebase despite us struggling with it for a couple of days. Even with the stress of our partner being gone we were able to really focus and get our stuff done. Thanks for being a great partner and project manager!

Eric Sayler: Really enjoyed working with Devin as our group’s project manager during our Fire Bae project. She started work on our project with a great, albeit somewhat ambitious mock-up/concept put together using Sketch which we later decided to pivot on due to time constraints. Devin did a great job keeping our group organized/staying on track throughout the weekend as we pivoted our project and was instrumental in keeping us on track to deliver a working minimum viable product ASAP ( given the shorter time frame than expected that we had to work on our project). Right off the bat she had some great ideas/ambitions but was also able to come up with necessary compromises when needed, and was great with continuing communication throughout the project both in person and remotely on Slack. Overall, I had a great time working with her and definitely benefited from her ability to motivate our team to produce a decent end product despite us not having time to complete our original ambitions. I look forward to working with Devin again given the chance in the future!

Hugh Morrison: Thank you for pairing with me this mod. I appreciate your accessibility and willingness to take the time to help. Your feedback and knowledge surrounding local storage was instrumental for the success of “idea box”. You very clearly have a solid grasp of the material we touched upon and I appreciate your communication style as well as the way you are able to translate complex thoughts to digestible tidbits. Your level building and event-listeners advice for breakout was huge. I look forward to our future pairing sessions!

Michael Fenwick: When recently paired with Devin I found her extremely easy to work with. She was very knowledgable and forthcoming with everything that she knows and willing to do her upmost to help us improve our code. I can tell by her enthusiasm that she loves to code and gets a lot of satisfaction out of the things she has built. I look forward to pairing with Devin again.

### Playing a Part

I opened myself up for paring for M1 students. I helped a bunch of different groups on their Number Guesser and Idea Box projects. I also paired with a group on their Game Time project and it was fun to see the progress the M1 students had made from their earlier projects (I worked with a few of the same people on different projects). I wanted to volunteer for Try Turing (I may have done that once this mod, but I’ve done like three of them now and they all blend together), but I feel like they weren’t posted like they usually are asking for volunteers. I really enjoy Try Turing weekends and hope to do more of them in the future. Unfortunately I didn’t get a chance to volunteer with the Boys and Girls club much this mod, but I also hope to make it to more of those soon.

### Gear Up

Micro Aggressions: This gear up was really interesting in that our group of four had three red heads, which lead to some really interesting conversations about stereotypes that are made and things we hear. Overall, I liked the articles for this gear up, but I wish we had more time to read them. The one I started reading toward the end was an article that was essentially a case study and the results and was so long it would take an hour or so to go through the whole thing.

Journey Mapping: This was a fun thing to do. I've done this before as an activity at a previous job and it really stretches your mind to think of scenarios that customers will encounter and see how it effects their experience.

Grit: It was good to reflect on how Turing brings out the grit in us. We had a lot of good conversations about how passion plays a huge part in grit and whether or not you pull through and succeed.
