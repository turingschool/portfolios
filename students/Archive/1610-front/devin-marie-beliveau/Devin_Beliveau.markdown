# Devin Beliveau - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to work on logic skills and teaching ability. Since I repeated the mod, I was excited to get to pair and help people not only for them, but also because teaching helps me learn as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
I don't do math.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
What can I say. I like talking out loud to myself.
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
Having done most of the work before, I enjoyed helping people learn.
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
I really enjoyed working on my portfolio. I'm trying to like Twitter more. I also offered to help people problem solve as much as I could.
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4
In addidtion to normal Turing community events, I started volunteering at the Boys and Girls Club with some members of my posse to teach girls to code.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
Progression: 3
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 4
Collaboration: 4

Over all I think it went well. I know I need to focus on workflow a little more. I don't know why I get so caught up in assessments, but I do and because of that I tend to make silly mistakes that I normally wouldn't. Even though I wanted to get more of the actual coding done in the assessment, I realize the importance of talking things out and being thorough.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod I did the first two projects solo (Number Guesser and Linked List)

I also spent a lot of time in the beginning of the mod working on my personal portfolio. But at this point I want to start over on it again anyway.

#### Number Guesser

* [https://github.com/devinmarieb/number-guesser-two](Number Guesser)
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html](Number Guesser Spec)

Build a game where the user picks a number between 1 and 100. When the user wins, the range of numbers to guess between increases.

Can always refactor more. (Sorry, for some reason I can't find my notes on this eval).

UX/UI: 4
Functional Expectations: 4
JS Style: 3

#### Linked List

* [https://github.com/devinmarieb/linked-list-two](Linked List)
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html](Linked List Spec)

A program that lets users save their bookmarks to a list with the ability to interact by marking them as read and deleting them.

Would have been nice to have some visual affordance for disabled buttons other than no hover. (hover does not work on mobile). JavaScript was really DRY and very well refactored - was worried about using global vars, but OK in some cases to not repeat query selections. Workflow was fine, only working as a team of one...so couldn't score higher than a 3 - needed some smaller feature branches instead of the whole phases HTML and CSS was clean, but wanted to see better use of unique IDs for JS and reuse of classes for CSS styling.

Functional Expectations: 4
JS Style: 4
Workflow: 3
HTML Style: 3
CSS Style: 4

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Had two solo projects, Idea Box and Game Time.

#### Idea Box

* [https://github.com/devinmarieb/Idea_Box](Idea Box)
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html](Idea Box Spec)

A a program that lets users add ideas and notes to a list. Interaction with user and list includes editing, marking as read and deleting. Everything must save in local storage.  

Could have had smaller commits (we had a few atomic commits). We could have definitely had drier code and implemented a few things that weren't on the spec, but that would have been nice (hitting enter submits an idea, etc). Our CSS sheet was organized by alphabetical properties, but we could have better organized by putting box model properties on top and order the rest accordingly.

Specification Adherence: 3
HTML Style: 4
CSS Style: 3
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 3
Collaboration: 3

#### Game Time

* [https://github.com/devinmarieb/game-time-md](Game Time)
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html](Game Time Spec)

A classic Breakout game with three levels of increased difficulty.

While we did have a lot of DRY code, there were a lot of instances where we could have broken out code into smaller functions. We didn't fully understand .bind() and were hardcoding bind methods into a lot of our functions. We had a bunch of tests, but were unsure of how to properly do integration testing, especially in terms of our collision detection.

Code Sanitation: 4
Functional Expectations: 3.5
User Interface: 4
Testing: 3
Javascript Style: 3
Workflow: 3

## D: Professional Skills
I really worked on trying to like Twitter and use it to my advantage. Unfortunately I still don't like it. I worked on my personal portfolio and have ideas of how to make it seem more professional. I'm also viewing volunteering at the Boys and Girls club as professional skill building because while I hope to have a career coding, I also enjoy teaching.

### Gear Up
#### Rock the Vote

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown](Rock the Vote)

This was my favorite Gear Up this mod. I really enjoyed reading the articles and having a thoughtful discussion around them. Like a lot of people, I wish we had more discussion time and less reading time. I think I was lucky in that I already knew most of my group members and we were able to talk a little more openly about everything.

### Gear Up
#### Introvert / Extrovert

No URL provided.

I really enjoyed how this Gear Up was broken up into our own classrooms. I personally really liked the video, but I can see how a lot of people maybe didn't. Despite what the speaker thought, she presented her story really well, but I also thought that none of it was information I hadn't already heard or read about. The discussion around the video in small groups in our classroom went really well and we talked a lot about how Turing caters to all personalities.

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown](Resilience)

While I liked this topic and the discussion my group had, I actually didn't enjoy the reading. I personally found a lot of issues with the logic of what was said in them. My group had a good discussion about how resilience has sort of become a buzz word and means completely different things to people. I personally think resilience has lost its profoundness in terms of the workplace. An interviewer/employer talking about resilience to an interviewee/employee may not have any idea what a person has been through in their life and may actually be minimizing the importance of resilience by redefining it to fit in their workplace environment.

### Professional Development Workshops

Did not attend any professional development workshops.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

I volunteered for two Try Turing events (the FE part) this mod and really had fun doing that. I hope to be confident enough in my skills where I can participate in both the back end and front end days. I participated in the SAB outing and while it was really fun, I think there should have been a specific time and place set aside for students to show up if they wanted to participate as a group rather than a range of times. As much as we tried to organize a specific plan after the fact, it did not work out so well. I enjoyed all the morning speakers I got to see.

### Giving Feedback

Idea Box - Anna
I had a great time working with Anna. Having done Idea Box before, it was fun working with someone and seeing their progression in learning. We tried to work together as much as possible, but we did end up having to split up some tasks because of time and her work on the project was really great. We communicated well and Anna was always on top of updating me when she made progress. My only feedback would be that Anna needs to trust that she knows more than she thinks she does.

Game Time - Mike
It was great getting to work with Mike on game time. We had similar interests in what we wanted to accomplish, so it was easy to agree on a game to make. While we had a few struggle days, we generally hit good strides and worked together well. It was great that our work styles were similar in that we liked problem pairing, but also both liked trying to problem solve alone and ask for help or feedback when we needed it. I was really impressed with how fast Mike caught on to the logic of the game we were making and I learned a lot through the process.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback to me:

Anna - Idea Box
I really enjoyed working with Devin. Once we got our skeleton of HTML and basic JS outlined, the project took off. Devin is an incredible coder and was able to solve issues we had very quickly. She was very supportive of my insecurities surrounding my abilities and I was grateful for that support. I think her skill really helped take our project through each phase quickly and I would be very happy to work with her again! - Anna

Mike - Game Time
Devin was a great teammate on the Game Time project. The project had its ebbs and flows but we stuck with it after starting over and running into many obstacles. Devin brought a lot of creativity to the table and was willing to work long days to get the project done. My only feedback would be to embrace the math :slightly_smiling_face:. It can be daunting at times but approaching it as a puzzle like all of the other code we work on might help. Overall a great project and would gladly work with Devin again on future projects. Thanks for being a team playaâ€™!

### Playing a Part

I participated in two Try Turing events. Not only did I enjoy helping everyone at Try Turing, but I was specifically asked for feedback about how the days went and what I noticed went well or not well. I also tried to make myself available to help by pairing with people who needed help on projects.
