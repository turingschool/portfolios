# Devin Beliveau - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of the module I set some goals around CSS, accessibility and JavaScript.
I wanted to feel like I had a solid handle on CSS, I wanted to feel comfortable in all
aspects of JavaScript that we would learn and I wanted to find out if accessibility features
and implementation was something I was interested in pursuing as a speciality.

## D: Professional Skills
This module I learned how to manage social media like Twitter and LinkedIn to my advantage. I also
learned about personal branding and saw a lot of really cool portfolios from grads and professionals
that I would like to model my own after. Working on teams has also taught me how to work collaboratively
with people I'm just getting to know who may have different learning styles and workflows.

My personal portfolio site:

### Gear Up
#### One: Managing the Learning Process
* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up was about how to manage your personal learning process and to be aware of the difference
between perceptual and sensory learning. We had group discussions around how we could start to map
out the learning process (sticky note examples) and start to see how we organize things in our brains
based on whether or not they are an automatic process or if it's something we have to use a lot of
brain power to solve. The end result was talking about how failures in the learning process can
effect our emotional state.

### Gear Up
#### Two: Extended posse meeting and Friday Spike
* [GitHub URL]()

I chose to participate in Code Wars.

### Gear Up
#### Three: Boundaries in Teams
* [GitHub URL]()

I actually found this GearUP a little awkward. We were meant to participate with our lunch roulette
group, and while we had some good discussions about the topics set forth to us, we had a member say
something that made me feel uncomfortable and unable to respond to them. I appreciate that that
specific member felt comfortable enough to share something personal, but I really didn't know
how to respond. We talked about people who are special to us and why. We discussed how we felt
about how other people react to the things we say and we talked about group dynamics.

### Gear Up
#### Four: No GearUp because of Labor Day.
* [GitHub URL]()

### Gear Up
#### Five: Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL]()

I did not participate because I was working on JS Foundations.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
To Christine on NumberGuesser
-I was excited to work with Christine for my first project because she brought a lot of fundamental skills that I knew I could learn from right away. It was great to be able to see how she approached the problem and broke down the project. She was flexible in her availability and knew that it was important to work together in person for our first project. She also has a great ability to talk out loud about her workflow and explain why she wanted to approach a problem the way she did. Overall, it was a great first project experience.

To Lacey on Number-Guesser
-Lacey and I were a part of a three-person team for our first project and we all worked well together and had great communication throughout the project. Our schedules happened to work well with each other and we were usually always available at the same time. I really appreciated Lacey's willingness to stay after class so we could work together in person. For a first project, working together in person was so helpful. We each contributed to the project in our own ways and worked together to problem solve when we got stuck. Overall it was a great first project and I enjoyed working with Lacey very much.

To Dale on Linked-List
-I was really excited to work with Dale because he knows so much about git and github (which I was struggling with at the time) and it was really helpful to spend the first forty-five minutes just going through the workflow and setting up the project correctly. It’s clear Dale really takes the time to think about how to break large pieces of projects into smaller parts and he made sure we understood why we were writing every line of code we did. Overall the linked-list was one of my favorite projects and I think it was because our workflow was so great.

To Maia on IdeaBox:
-This project was daunting because of all the new features that we had to add, but I really enjoyed working with Maia because we have a similar workflow and a similar approach to problems. I think we worked well trying to solve issues in a logical order once we figured out we shouldn’t just jump into code because we thought we knew how to do something. We broke down the project into smaller sections and tackled each section one by one, which was great because we got to celebrate small wins often. Even though we both had things going on during the week/weekend, we were able to accommodate work time and communicate effectively. IdeaBox was a tough project, and Maia was willing to commit a lot of time and energy to making sure everything got completed.

To Kristen on GameTime
-Kristen was a great partner to have going into Game Time (which was both an exciting and stressful project)! We took the time to discuss how we were both on a similar level of knowledge and easily picked a game to make that involved concepts we both felt we wanted a better understanding of. We broke down the project into small first steps and ultimately ended up scrapping our original set up and going with another. Our setup switched on a day Kristen had to be absent and I was impressed with her ability to quickly understand the new set up and be able to work with it right away. Kristen and I worked well keeping each other in check and making sure we were never stressed out. Kristen does a great job of not getting overwhelmed when things don’t work and has a great ability of taking a step back from the problem and looking at it from alternative solutions. Overall, this was my favorite project and a lot of it had to do with our partnering!

To Graham on community at Turing
-Graham is always willing to stop what he’s doing and try to help problem solve. I even saw him get up a few times during project work time and go around and ask if everyone was okay or needed help. I’m very appreciative of his efforts to make sure he was answering questions for people when he had the ability to.

To Hilary on community at Turing
-While I didn’t work on any projects with Hillary, I did get to partner with her on a small in class assignment. It was fun to work with her and see her workflow. I appreciate that she’s not afraid to ask questions in class and always jumped on things that myself (and I’m sure a lot of other people) had questions about too.

To Gabi on community at Turing
-It was great getting to talk to Gabi throughout the module. Often times I would think to seek her out to ask a question to based on her previous back-end experience. She is always willing to help out and try and problem solve. She also helped with some terminal/github stuff at the beginning of the module and I’m very appreciative of that.

### Being a Community Member

From Lacey on NumberGuesser
-I had a really great time working with Devin on our Linked List project. She is very good at picking apart larger problems and coming up with, and communicating, ways to solve them. She is very respectful of every one in the group and listens fully to ideas before responding, always providing great feedback while searching for a way to work together to tackle a problem.

From Christine on NumberGuesser
-I worked with Devin and Lacey on our first project, Number Guesser. Devin was a great addition to the team and I thought we all worked really well together. I appreciated the way she tackled problems and was able to see how everything fit together. Having this perspective is so important. Devin works hard to produce solid code and ensure the success of the team, and I look forward to working with her more.

From Dale on LinkedList
-Devin and I worked on the Linked List project.  I found Devin to be creative and easy to work with. We quickly established a great balance of pair and independent work time. Due to this we were able to bring things together effectively and learn from each other.  She was thoughtful about the approaches to the work and we were always able to talk constructively through challenges.  I look forward to working with her again.

From Maia on IdeaBox
-It was great working with you Devin. I felt like we communicated well. We were frustrated with the project at times, but we managed to work through our struggles, step by step. We shared the workload and generally had a great workflow. Thank you for working around my schedule when needed. I appreciate your flexibility. I wish we had time to refactor a bit more, but all in all, I'm proud of our work!

From Kristen on GameTime
-I had such a pleasant experience working with Devin on our final project, Game Time, for Mod 1! I felt from the beginning that we were on the same page- from our individual skill levels to our vision for the project- and that held for the duration of the project. I was absent for a work day where there was pairing time with Mod 2 students, and Devin did an impressive job of keeping me informed on changes that were made. Furthermore, she was able to effectively communicate to me the things she learned on the day I was gone and how we would be able to apply them moving forward in the project. Devin is a very direct communicator, and I think this was a major contributor to the success of our partnership. We paired through the toughest parts of the project, and I always felt like we were working cohesively, largely a result of solid communication. When we were not working as a pair, Devin consistently communicated her thoughts and approaches via Slack. I truly hope we get to work together again soon!

From Graham on community at Turing
-Devin is a great asset to our program. She is a consistently positive presence in our cohort and always strives to bring out the best in her peers. I’ve been happy to be her colleague and friend during this module, and I hope to be paired with her in the future.

### Playing a Part

I always tried to make myself available to help problem solve even though I may not actually know the answer. It's sometimes just as important to be there for someone to talk out loud to so they can think
more clearly about their problem. I usually came in early and stayed late and made sure to ask if people were doing okay or if they needed a break from their work.

I participated in as many lunch roulettes, speakers and gear ups as possible. I really enjoyed these events partly because they involved people from the back end program who I don't get to see and talk to on a regular basis. I've made it a point to really try and remember names and faces of back enders so I can say hi when I see them next. I also joined a posse I'm really excited to continue working with next mod.
