#### Completed Prework Deliverables:

Did all the reading and watched all the videos. There was an Express tutorial involved.

#### Homework Assignments

Web Scraping: This was really fun. I was looking forward to this for a while. I tried to build a scraper that would log into various beer sites by entering a birthday, entering a zip code and finding locations around me where I can buy that beer.  

Static Comp Carousel Challenge: This was fun. I wasn't really looking forward to it when we started, but the more I worked on it the more fun it became. 

Choo Choo Web Tokens: I want to understand this better. I need to come back to it multiple times. I think this is something that I just don't understand as well as other things. 



#### End of Module Assessment

Spec Adherence: 3.5

JS Style: 3

Testing: 3

CSS Style: 3

UI: 3

Workflow: 3

I really enjoyed doing this. It was the first assessment where I wasn't nervous going into it. Building the actual app was fun, but I struggled with Heroku and testing for quite some time. All in all it was a good final and I like it a lot.

#### Individual Work & Projects

BYOB: Trip Planner

I built my own CRUD database. It used country specific data and set it up so users could plan a trip to specific countries.

Points: 150/150

#### Group Work & Projects

JetFuel

This project was really hard! I was nervous learning something completely new. But in the end, it felt really nice to finish this project. And it showed me it was really about the repitition. By the end of the project I felt like I had learned a lot.

Points: 125/150

Markostractions (Electron)

This project was super fun because we used MarkoJS, which as far as we know, has never been used for an Electron app in the past. It was a really great learning experience and we got to talk to both of the guys at Ebay who wrote Marko. Our blog posts were retweeted by the MarkoJS Twitter account.

#### Professional Skills

Job Hunting: I really amped up job hunting this mod because I felt ready to actually be employed. I got a lot of good stuff out of warm contacts, but I honestly didn't get a lot of out of cold outreach. Of the group of people I reached out to, I only got one response. I was able to get one job offer from a start up that I had to turn down, but I have some other things going on. 

MeetUps: Meetups were not geat this mod. The timing for all of the ones I wanted to go to was terrible. I went to the Denver Scripts MeetUp which is my favorite. It wasn't as fun or as frutiful as last time. I also went to my first ReactJS MeetUp. It was fun and I got a lot out of it. I would love to go back. 


#### Feedback and Community Participation

##### Giving Feedback

Gabi: Working with you on our first backend project was really fun. I think we both went into it with a calm attitude and we were able to knock a lot of functionality out right in the beginning. We got caught up on some stuff at the end of the project, but you were super committed to working as much as possible to get all the bugs out. Even though we had different schedules, you made yourself available to screen hero. Over all this was a great first project and I’m really glad we finally got to work together!

Dylan: You pushed us to use something new and random and it was super fun! We didn’t have a ton of code, but our app was awesome and we had a really amazing learning experience. You worked really hard on a lot of bugs we had early on and really helped iron out how the project needed to be set up. Thanks for pushing us to do new and exciting things!

Chelle: CHELLE! We finally got to work together. You have the ability to stay focused even when things get crazy, which I really appreciated. We had a pretty big bug half way through the project and if it wasn’t for you I probably wouldn’t have had the mental energy to try as hard to fix it. We spent a long time talking to Patrick (and Michael) and diving deep into Webpack to fix our problems. You’re a super awesome partner. 

Capstone: As a whole, we did an amazing job knowing what needed to be worked on in pairs and what needed to be broken out into individual tasks. We kept our workflow sane (for the most part) and didn’t really have any major issues until the last day. Elijah definitely took the lead in terms of staying on track and making sure people had things to work on. Anna, Gabi and Bekah did an amazing job working on wireframes in the first day to make sure we all knew what we would need to build out first and what was most important. Elijah, you and I worked on reformatting your database that first day and it was really awesome to be able to work through your code with you. We all had a hand in every part of the project, which was super awesome to see. Bekah, you took the lead on forms which a huge thing to tackle and it looks and functions so well! It was really awesome that we all met at Thump on Saturday and just sat and worked separately but together on all our stuff. That day was huge and the project really started coming together. I’m super proud of our capstone and hope that it’s a thing that will live on 4evah.

##### Getting Feedback

Chelle: Devin has become one of my favorite people in our mod.  She works hard, speaks her mind, and is amazingly proficient in her programming.  We worked together on the Imposter Syndrome Electron app and Devin continues to deliver when it comes to diving in head first into unchartered waters.  We encountered a few hiccups with the Marko.js and Devin continued to plug away until we had a working product.  Who ever snatches her up for a job will be lucky to have her as an asset on their team.

Dylan: 
Devin B. was great to work with.
Her advice when followed, always worth it.
She's really smart, and not distracted
She gets things started, so proactive. 
In this Tech world,
She's right at home,
The Community, could use her groans
She has no fear to let it be known 
And I hope she likes my feedback poem

Gabi: I felt that our ability to communicate on Jet Fuel was on-point and I attribute much of our success to this. We were able to pair well together on tougher obstacles, as well as break down our workload into individual components that allowed us to work separately. While I would struggle with a problem for a bit longer than I should have, you did a great job with knowing when to reach out to others for help, and I can certainly learn from that. Also, we work at different paces, and I did appreciate our mini stand-up meetings to catch each other up on the project's status. Thank you for being a great partner in tackling Node, PostgreSQL, Knex.js, and re-learning how to utilize vanilla JS!

CAPSTONE

Anna: Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project. I appreciate that you all were tolerant of my schedule. The work Devin, Elijah, and Bekah put into the logic of the project was outstanding. Reformatting the database, setting up the pop ups, and passing data around were huge tasks and they look great. I think my biggest regret is that we didn’t use Waffle better. We were really good about putting issues in and closing them, but not good about following them around and actively assigning work. As a result, I think the work was fairly uneven and I regret that I didn’t take a more active role in building out the components. It felt a little like Gabi and I were left picking up whatever was left at any given point, which was occasionally very little because so many things were tightly bound to each other. That said, Elijah did an excellent job as de facto PM checking in with people and giving direction when requested. I think that as a whole our communication and collaboration was good despite some people very clearly wanting to work alone. There’s an unfortunate balance that needs to be struck between ensuring everyone is on the same page and just getting the work done. When there are slower and/or less assertive people on a team, it’s difficult to know when those people need encouragement, when they need to step up, and when they just need to sit back and let the project get done. All that said, I’m really proud of this project and grateful for all the work you all did in making it work so well. Thanks for having me as part of your team!

Gabi: We did a great job in the beginning of the project with communicating as a group on how we wanted our UX/UI to look. From that point, we started to assign tasks to others and pair or work individually. After the first few days, I feel that we suffered from not doing a DTR session or appointing a PM. Some of the tasks were bundled together, making it hard to break things into smaller components for others to work on. While I was struggling with some portions, I did appreciate Elijah, Devin, or Anna pairing with me to help figure out some issues. In hindsight, I wish that we had been able to plan better and assign tasks in a more efficient manner. I feel like I got swept into the role of picking up small tasks, which is still valuable. Perhaps involving everyone in the API planning at some point would have made everyone feel included on all aspects of the project. At the same time, we were working on a huge project with a tight deadline which left little time to catch everyone up on everything. This was a large project with a large group, and there were bound to be some conflicts, but I do appreciate our time together.

#### Playing a Part

IronFE: This mod I took charge of Thursday IronFE. I did a combinatin of interview questions, binary questions and object questions. It was fun and I learned something new every time I did it.

Planning a Gear Up: This mod we had to plan a GearUp. I really enjoyed this and I think it will be great to continue to do with future mods. Having students come up with new ideas would be super cool.
