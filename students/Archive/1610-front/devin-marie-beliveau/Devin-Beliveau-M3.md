# Devin Beliveau - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Object and array manipulation, Redux.
I wish I could say I was good at building boiler plates and Webpack, but I would be lying to myself.

##Misc:
#### Completed Prework Deliverables:
For pre work I did 10 Wes Bos JS30 exercises, Reduxtagram, and the NodeSchool exercises. 

The only things I found useful were the Wes Bos JS30 exercises. I got absolutely nothing out of Reduxtagram and NodeSchool. NodeSchool focused on Express, which we didn't go over. Reduxtagram moved too fast and I had no context. 

#### Homework Assignments
UX/UI Challenges: Swipe-able Cards & SideBar Navigation

I thought these were cool, but I don't know that I got much out of them. As with Reduxtagram, it moved way too fast and all it really was was me stopping the video every 30 seconds to catch up and frantically type code. Stopping every minute or so made these exercises take upwards of two hours and no one has time in this program to repeat something like that again to gain a better understanding.

## A: End of Module Assessment

TayTay says I passed. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod we had two solo projects, Walker Texas Rangerbox and our Personal Projects.

#### Walker Texas Rangerbox

Our first project this mod was a joke generator that intorduced us to Router 3. We had to hit a joke API and display jokes on the screen based on paramaters set by the user.

Spec Adherence: 3

Code Quality: 3.5

Design: 4

Testing: 4

#### NYTBookshelf

My personal project used React / Redux, Router 3 and localStorage. I built an app that pulls in seven of the New York Times best seller lists and displays them on the page. A user can switch between lists and add and delete favorites. I plan to continue to work on this and build in a Firebase backend so users can log in.

Completion: 4

Organization: 4

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group projects, Movie Database and remEMBER. We also had a static comp challenge with a partner from Mod4.

#### Not Quite Netflix (Movie Tracker)

This project involved working with a database built by Taylor and it was our first experience with React / Redux. We had to create an app that targets the Movie DataBase API and returns a list of all current movies. A user had to be able to log in and save and delete favorites.

Spec Adherence: 3

Redux Architecture: 3

Routing: 4

JS Style: 3

Testing: 4

Workflow: 4

#### remEMBER

This was both a git flow and Ember project. The idea was to build a notes taking app. We were released issues three or four at a time and we had to solve the issues and get our PR merged before we could submit PRs for other issues. 

Score: Passed, all issues released were resolved.

#### Static Comp Challenge

This project would have been fun if it wasn't in weeks 4 and 5 of the mod. No one had the time to put in the work required to do this. We were just starting our personal projects. Mod4 had a lot going on. Mod3 carried this project, we did most of the work. The day it was due was the same day Mod4 had to take their 10 hour exam which is a little messed up.

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up

* [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The Parable of Polygons site was super awesome to play with. It was a good way to visualize a problem that most people think doesn't exist or choose to ignore. We had some good discussions about the state of the US and how Turing is and isn't doing its job at making the school a divirse place.

### Gear Up

* [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

My group and I had some really great discussions about automation, the future and the US government. It was heated in a good way. We talked about self driving cars, computer programs that can replace doctors and lawerys and how this will effect the economy.

### Gear Up

* [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

This very much felt like a follow up to automation. We continued to discuss the economic impact of automation and how we could address it as a country. We talked about typical reactions from the US vs European countries and how we think the US would handle automation and UBI.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Denver Scripts Meetup
I went to the Denver Scripts JavaScripts meetup in January. It was a really good time. There were two presenters, one that went over testing React and one that made a library for CSS. It was both awesome and concerning that it seems like as students, we may know more than people in the industry. The guy who gave the demonstration on testing React said he had never touched Enzyme. Either way, it was a good experience. There were people there who were looking to hire for certain things and it was a good opportunity to connect.
#### DVLP Denver
There was a DVLP Denver meetup the first week of February. It was less orgainzied than the Scripts meetup, but there were still a lot of people there and I talked to a lot of them. A lot of people there were interested in development, but didn't have any experience yet. It was presented as a place for employers to find employees, but there was no one there looking to hire.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
### Giving Feedback
To Josh: Josh, it was really great to get to work with you on the movie project. You really championed Redux and made sure that Steph and I understood what was happening and why it was happening in certain places. You worked really hard on making sure we had all functionality done by the time the project was due which was great for team motivation. You’re a very patient person and it was really awesome getting to learn Redux with you.

To Steph: Steph, the movie project was stressful for everyone, but your attitude during the whole thing was very calming and it really helped me destress when we kept hitting road blocks. You’re so dedicated to getting problems solved and you work super hard. I was really impressed with all the work you did getting our testing set up and your ability to mock and stub data (which I am terrible at). I can only hope that one day my testing skills are as great as yours. It was also really cool to work over screen hero. My experience partnering on screen hero in the past wasn't great, but this time around it was super awesome.

To Mike Z: Mike, I had fun working on the Ember project with you because our personalities are very similar and we both have such a dry sense of humor. I really enjoyed working through the flow of the project and switching off between issues. We talked out loud a lot during this project which was really great for my learning. You helped me a lot trying to figure out how to set upstream stuff for the repos and you got stuff rendering on the page after a half a day of being unable to do during our first set of issues, which was super frustrating. And also our jokes were on point!

### Playing a Part
From Josh: Devin was a terrific asset to our team. I thought we worked well together since we are both fairly flexible people. Very quick to pick up new things, it was easy to get her involved in the code I had been writing and get intelligent and useful suggestions. We paired most days and it was incredibly helpful to be able to bounce things off her to try to negotiate what direction we should take on the project. Overall, very talented and a pleasure to work with.

From Steph: The movie project was stressful but I’m glad we were able to work together. You’re very sharp but humble, which is a rarity at Turing, and makes for a great team-member. I also really appreciated your ability to articulate your way through problem-solving, something I struggle with and really benefit from hearing. I also really appreciate your dedication to the project and your work ethic! Thanks for being a great team member!

From Mike Z: I had a great time working with Devin on the RemEMBER project. I appreciate how patient you were patient when I was having trouble conceptualizing one of the issues we were given. You were easy to communicate with both in person, and over slack. If we were planning on meeting up you communicated when you would be there and were on time and that is greatly appreciated. The work flow of this project made me more comfortable with PRs and working on issues. Writing jokes in our tests made the project less boring and I even had some fun. Why does a chicken coop only have two doors???? IF IT HAD 4 IT WOULD BE A CHICKEN SEDAN!!
