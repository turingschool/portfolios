# chelle tuerk - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus in module 2 revolved around finding my groove.  It appears I'm a late bloomer, but have found a passion for programming that can only come naturally...I'm one of the lucky ones.  My goals were to dig deep and find a thorough understanding, and I've learned that only comes with an absurd amount coding.  I'm on the verge of being where I would like to be, but have finally dismissed any insecurities now knowing that the drive is there and has truly set in.  I'm Neo entering the Matrix.

## Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
## Instructor: Jhun
## Comments:

 - WTF?! this is some of the best organized code I've seen for this project to date.
 - small opportunities to clean up small things (filter() instead of forEach())
 - tests were great!
 - WTF?!

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


### Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.


### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Utilization of es6

* 4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.


### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.


### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Stephanie Andrews' Feedback
Chelle Tuerk's enthusiasm and dedication for coding are contagious.  She carefully considers the overall structure and is insistent on improving her craft, which is evident in the components of 2DoBox.  Her flexibility, patience, and communication skills make her an excellent team-member.  One practice that might be helpful in the future for her, is checking the docs for unfamiliar terminology/errors before adjusting the code to address the error with a best guess.  It was a pleasure to work with her.  


# Shoot The Breeze

### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

### Mike Ziccardi's Feedback
I enjoyed working with chelle on shoot the breeze. I think we complimented eachother very well and worked cohesively on all aspects of the project. Chelle's ability to buckle down and dig into difficult concepts helped me to learn things that I was struggling with as well. She's always trying to get better, and that is something that is hard to come by. You're Killing it Chelle!

### Elijah Williams' Feedback
It was great working on the budget app with you.  You showed a ton of grit and delivered some awesome code.  Make sure you’re focused on understanding all of your code and take time to refactor.  Break down your code into simple steps that you feel comfortable executing.  Keep up the awesome work!

### Jeff Buss' Feedback
Chelle is a gem. She is a fucking firecracker, which is rare breed at Turing. I greatly appreciate someone who is willing to speak their mind, work hard as hell, and make shit happen. I generally don't swear quite this much, but it seems applicable when describing Chelle.

This attitude can come with drawbacks, but they are few and far between. At times Chelle can decide to take the lead on tasks without *explicitly* consulting the group first. This can be great in some situations, but generally it would be better if the group was fully aware of what was happening. Chelle could also be more diligent with her github usage, as I got sick of fixing merge conflicts. Bless her soul, but I've never had more issues regarding version control than I did working on our budget app despite working in multi-person groups prior to this.

Chelle was on the brink of heading up to the mountains on more than one occasion, but despite Elijah and I telling her to take a damn break she still decided to keep cranking out code for an absurd number of hours. She is an incredibly driven, outspoken, and intelligent individual who will undoubtedly find a place on the most interesting of teams upon entering the workforce. I look forward to working with her in the future once she bookmarks github.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)


* Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?
* Is that lens helpful?
* Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
* We were asked to reflect on a time at Turing when we were tempted to give up.
* How can I imbue my work over the next week and next inning to be more "filled with purpose."

##### Reflection of difficult time at Turing:

Having required a retake for mod 1 and being encouraged to repeat:
At my portfolio defense I was terrified by the situation I found myself in, both at Turing, in general, and the internal conflict of whether it'd be in my best interest to repeat mod 1.  That is, until Louisa actually used the word 'grit'.  I believe that about myself.  This gear up reminds me of the resilience gear up on 9-4-16.  I believe these two characteristics are related.  
I've played an instrument my whole life.  Three years ago I decided to teach myself guitar.  Being back in that place where I don't understand how it's possible to move 2 hands in 2 different directions and 10 fingers doing 10 different things.  Inconceivable!! (Princess Bride reference!)  I now do open mic sessions.  
I sometimes relish that dumbfounded, mass-confusion feeling where I never really wonder IF I'm capable of something, I wonder WHEN I will be capable of it.

Is the grit lens helpful?
Yes.  I'm so stubborn that when someone tells me I can't, that passion rises up in me.

Problematic when I need a break?
Balance is everything and I'm constantly trying to find it...in everything.

Imbue my work?
I've finally found the sought-after obsession I've been looking for with programming.  It took a minute.  From the hardships of mod 1 being said, in nicer words, "I'm not good enough", all that's turned around since then.  Things are still insanely difficult, but do-able.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


#### TO STEPHANIE ANDREWS
Steph is an example of an ideal partner to collaborate on a project.  She’s willing to work long hours, is communicative, and extremely sharp in her thought process.  Additionally, her calm demeanor sets a tone that I look for in every project.  It allows for thorough examination of code and deep understanding.  We put out a quality application that I’m proud of and it would be a pleasure to work with her again.  It might be helpful in the future if you operated as the ‘driver’ a bit more.  You voiced concerns about being unsure of yourself during our project.  It was great working with you! (edited)


#### TO STACIE McWILLIAMS  
Stacie was a joy to pair with.  She has a bright outlook and is willing to acknowledge being uncomfortable to get to a place where concepts begin to sink in.  Her approach to programming is refreshing and will benefit her along the way.  I empathize in the stress load and it’s a pleasure to see that she is aware of the bigger picture and how to get there.


#### TO JEFF BUSS
Jeff is a great guy with a great outlook.  He’s able to extinguish a stressful situation with humor and a “What’s next?” approach.  Additionally, his willingness to work on any part of a project is welcomed, he doesn't cherry-pick tasks to suit his taste.  Always innovative with his CSS makes him a reliable asset to any team.


#### TO ELIJAH WILLIAMS  
Elijah is a centered, smart, and hard-working guy.  He tackles difficult concepts and works until they’re finished.  I appreciate the thorough discussion involved in each step of the process, and he doesn’t agree to something unless it makes sense.  Our project was a stressful, time-restricted undertaking and Elijah never cut any corners.

#### TO MIKE ZICCARDI  
Mike is the IDEAL collaborative partner.  He insists on clean code, thorough research, and presents himself in a cool, collected way that encourages growth from himself and others( meaning me, in this instance, of course).  Communication was a breeze, as Mike was always quick to respond which allowed for us to be on the same page at all times.  Additionally, Mike was able to show me some things that I wasn’t privy to, such as breaking out testing components.  He’s patient, positive, and demands only the best from himself.  I work would with Mike again in a heartbeat.  We put out a chat app that I’m proud to have completed with him as my partner. (edited)

### Being a Community Member

#### FROM LAUREN PESCE
Chelle helped me with my number guesser in react project, as well as other small problems throughout the mod. I completely appreciate how patient and understanding you are and gave me your full attention when I really needed it. You were able to make quick and thought out decisions to come up with intelligent solutions to my questions. Thanks for the support!
#### FROM MARISSA REINKE
Chelle was really awesome to work with during pairing. We paired during my game-time project and for me the most stressful week of the mod. Her positive attitude and excitement about coding was a breath of fresh air and was contagious.

#### FROM STACIE McWILLIAMS
I have gotten to pair with and just interact with Chelle a bit during my first Mod. I really enjoy working with her and actually have a pairing scheduled for tomorrow. She has this contagious positive energy and I really enjoy being around her. She had great ideas to get me started on my second project that helped tremendously. Even more she helped me when I needed to talk to someone about the rigors of the program. Sharing my concerns with her was really helpful and encouraging for me. Thanks Chelle!
#### FROM KYLE ZUCKER
Chelle is great! She was very enthusiastic and helpful in our paring session!
#### FROM MIKE ZICCARDI

### Playing a Part

Participating in the Turing Community, for me, consisted of attending Friday Speakers regularly.  I attended Demo night presentations.  I also made myself available to Mod 1 students and paired with them throughout the module.  Additionally, I meet every week with my Mentor.  Turing or bust!

I want to see you give a conference talk.

Don't forget to take breaks.

Avoid jumping around in code, write some psuedo-code.
