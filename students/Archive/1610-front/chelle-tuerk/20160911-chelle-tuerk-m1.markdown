### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [Number Guesser Application](https://chelletuerk.github.io/number_guesser)
* [Code Base](https://github.com/chelletuerk/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number guesser is a web-based application that generates a random number provoking the user to guess between two whole integers.  The application prompts a screen that indicates if the guess is too high or too low and allows for another guess.  When the correct number is guessed the application expands its integer range for another round.

UX/UI Expectations

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
Functional Expectations

* 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One
Fundamental JavaScript Style

* 2.5 Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

Feedback from Chaz-Mykl Gormley:

"Working with Chelle on the first paired project, "Number Guesser", was a great learning experience. Chelle's willingness to struggle through a project as a team, was EXTREMELY helpful! At times in this program we'll experience the feeling of being "left behind", with a partner marching along and completing many tasks, while you try to grasp the basics of certain problems. With Chelle, that was never a problem, as we both took time to explain to one another what we had worked on when we had our individual nights work to discuss from the day before. It would've been great to work together face-to-face on the project a bit more, and I've found that that has benefitted both of us greatly in the projects we've worked on individually, since "Number Guesser". With that in mind, Chelle and I were still able to turn in a great project and, more importantly, grasp the concept(s) behind "Number Guesser", which will surely come in handy as we progress in the program. Overall, the time spent working with Chelle was not only informative as far as the program here at Turing is concerned, but fun as well - Chelle is a great programmer and an amazing person - I look forward to working with her in the future, to see how far we'll both have come since our "Number Guesser" days."




#### Linked List

* [Linked List Application](https://chelletuerk.github.io/linked-list/)
* [Code Base](https://github.com/chelletuerk/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

"Chelle - You were an incredible partner and I enjoyed working with you for our Linked List project. I am so impressed by your strong motivation skills and passion to do the best possible work. Your problem solving skills and work ethic are something that I strive for. It’s no wonder we share the ‘adaptability’ strength - your ability to “roll with the punches” and stay calm even in the most stressful situations allowed us to make a project we are both confident in."

Feedback from Dan Grund:

"Chelle good work on this project. I think we were both out of our element and trying to wrap our heads around how the whole thing works.
I appreciate your initiative in asking for help and pairing to learn what we need to to accomplish the task at hand. However I do believe
it would be beneficial for you to spend more time trying to problem solve an issue before seeking outside help. Anyhow, it was a pleasure
working with you and I am proud of our final result."

Feedback from Noah Peden:

"I was worried before we were assigned partners about who I was going to get for a two week project partner, but it turns out my worries were for naught as I got you as my partner!! I am grateful for your abilities to quickly grasp and tackle difficult concepts/problems and willingness to put in late nights so that we can accomplish what is needed. I am also a huge fan of your humor, ability to listen to my side, and styling skills. My only constructive criticism would be to plan out your path to a Minimal Viable Product and really stick to that before adding on extra features or things. Overall you were a pleasure to work with and I don't think our game would've turned out half as well as it did without you. Thanks for rocking!!"

## D: Professional Skills
It is my intention to enhance and fine-tune my professional skills while attending Turing.  I believe the 'gear ups' are a notable avenue in accomplishing this goal.

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/chelletuerk/191e28b5ebdbf23e574b1312f81ebbb6)

Having attending the gear up on resilience it's interesting to note the scientific approach taken in group studies
concerning this topic.  Our group consisted of Joey Stansfield, Jesse Spevack, and myself.  I felt we had a very
positive dynamic and discussed the multi-faceted topic in great detail.  The rubric asked that we consider the
connection between individual's mindsets and resilience.  With that in mind, we agreed, as a group, that it's
all a matter of one's perception in direct relation to how resilient a mindset they adopt:  The act of the ego
taking over and allowing in self pity versus 'rolling with the punches'.  We agreed that the former condition can
create an outlook that clouds one's judgement, allowing for emotions to seep in.  

The articles we read discussed resiliency as a skill.  It touched on individuals being built with the same evolved
response-system to something traumatic.  Additionally, this disposition can be calibrated and trained in response to stimuli.
I adopt the philosophy of trauma as a growth opportunity.  There's a need to dismiss self-pity and focus on what matters most

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Matt Kaufman:

* "Matt was an exceptional help in pairings. He insisted I find the answer on
my own, yet furnished guidance in helping me on my way. Additionally, he
provided a sense of self-confidence in areas where I saw I was lacking.
I would recommend Matt's approach to anyone seeking further clarity in
programming. His knowledge of the subject is unsurpassed."

Feedback for Graham Nessler:

* "Graham was a huge help in bridging a gap between concepts that I
couldn't seem to wrap my head around.  It is clear he has a concern for
helping others along their way and makes it abundantly clear through his
patient guidance and last minute pairings."

Feedback for Nick Chambers:

* "Pairing with Nick was a huge help in furthering my knowledge of programming.  He made it clear that he truly cares about helping along the newer students at Turing by obliging to last minute pairings and working on difficult problems until the solution is found.  Despite the stressful atmosphere, Nick emits a perfect balance of professionalism coupled with a calm humor that is much appreciated during 'crunch time'."

Feedback for Gabi Procell:

* "Gabi was exceptional in our pairing session.  I appreciate how patient you are and willing to spend time on a subject until I understood it fully.  I will certainly be pairing with Gabi in the future."

Feedback for Chaz-Mykl Gormley:

* Chaz, I appreciate the effort you put forth in making sure all concepts of the project were understood to the fullest.  It is
commendable that you insist on knowing the in's and out's of every piece of code.  You set the tone for a work ethic necessary
to produce high-quality results.  I would've liked more time spent face-to-face, however, the time we did have with each other
was extremely productive.  You are an outstanding example of someone who takes pride in their work and it was a sincere
pleasure to work with you.

Feedback for Lauren Pesce:

* Lauren, you were an absolute pleasure to partner with for the Linked List project.  I appreciate that you value the
challenge it presented and the initiative taken in presenting a final product we could both be proud of.  Your dedication in
taking time necessary to complete all phases of the project is commendable.  I feel we produced results through hard work and
research that show a commitment to high-quality work.  I would very much like working with you in the future knowing that you
hold a standard of excellence as your first priority.

Feedback for Dan Grund:

* Dan, you were very pleasant to work with on this project.  I value your patience in allowing me to digest the information
and the time required for me to comprehend all aspects of the project.  Additionally, I appreciate that you recognize the
importance in producing a quality product and not cutting any corners.  However, on a select few instances, it was difficult
to communicate with you while you were wearing headphones.  Ultimately, the experiene was a vary valuable and enjoyable one
and I'd be pleased to work with you in the future.

Feedback for Noah Peden:

* Noah was an exceptional example of the type of individual to be paired with on a project.  He puts in long hours, showing a
true dedication to a final product we are both proud of.  Additionally, he takes programming very seriously and is determined
in finding a solution, which was clearly illustrated by his devoted manner in which he attacks a complicated problem.  I look
forward to working more with Noah and am grateful to have been partnered with him for the game-time project.

Feedback for Dylan Avery:

* "Dylan has a serious talent for understanding complicated code that most are unable to wrap their head around.  He experiments with ideas that are seemingly impossible, yet somehow finds a way to make them fully functional.  He’s a great asset to have in class and is approachable and patient when asked questions."  





### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Dylan Avery:

* “Chelle is one of the most artistically gifted students in our cohort. She has a great eye for design, and had one of the best early iterations of a personal website. She is truly a joy to be around and has an infectious personality which can uplift the entire cohort at times.”

Feedback from Regis Boudinot:

* "At first Chelle was a bit all over the place :joy: and trying to immediately understand absolutely everything that was going on. In the last two weeks however, she understands that coding is like eating an elephant. You gotta do it one bite at a time. No easy way around it.

The velocity in which she throws idea into code now is impressive. She understands the concepts faster than what she needs to write. Which honestly is a key trait for a good programmer. I can't count how many times I just sit and think about how to do something before writing code for a few hours and it's done. Some people like to hack away until they understand both the concept as well as the code that needs to be thrown down.

Her knowledge of spacial entities such as git and how files talk to each other has grown exponentially in the last few weeks as well.

She likes to talk a lot but that's not a bad thing. Accidental rubber ducking will get you far.

I say keep at it. If the current pace at which you are picking things up maintains, you will be in a good place."
