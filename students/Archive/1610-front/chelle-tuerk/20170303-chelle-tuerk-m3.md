# chelle tuerk - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus this module was to expand the areas in which I can choose to become proficient.  The exposure to different frameworks has allowed me to get a taste for what I enjoy and what I excel at.  
Fine-tuning JavaScript basics is also an integral part of my educational goals, and this mod did not disappoint.  I believe, at the core, this is the most important area for me to continue to develop and look forward to becoming progressively more comfortable with more complicated data structures.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Walker Texas RangerBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chelletuerk/walker-texas-rangerBox)
* [Original Assignment](#### (Project Name)

This is a joke machine that pumps out all the good times!  It utilizes React and React Router--our first introduction to routing.

Student: Chelle Tuerk Notes: Ran into some problems with routing with improper nesting that caused some further problems down the road, but did a great job overcoming those bugs by finding alternative solutions to implement the same functionality. App was in a useable state though didn't 100% match design specs due to improvisation. Was able to persist data to localStorage and added many tests, though they were very tightly tied to the HTML.

Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


#### Shut up and Dance

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chelletuerk/shut-up-and-dance)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This self-directed project demands you shut your mouth and shake it.  It's a small scale version of Spotify utilizing the Spotify API, OAuth, React-Redux, and React Router.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Groovy Movies

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chelletuerk/groovy-moovyz)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

This movie app utilizes the IMDB database to fetch API data.  The app allows for 'favoriting' a movie and adding a new user, saving this information to the backend server.

Students & Project: Lauren, Chelle, Dylan || Movies

Evaluator: Brittany

Notes: Great job refactoring and getting the app into a working state over the last couple days of the project. Demonstrated a much clearer understanding of React/Redux architecture, and was able to solve bugs previously reported. Routing issues were resolved and worked splendidly. Testing should be slightly less linked to the HTML/DOM Content, but solid effort put in across the board there.

MOVIE SPEC:

Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

#### Feedback from Dylan Avery:
Working with Chelle Tuerk is truly a joy. I enjoy it so much that I pair with her all the time now even though we are no longer working on a specific project together. Her unbounded energy is exciting, and makes me feel like I am in the show Silicon Valley. Chelle has all the personality traits of someone who makes a big impact on the world. I think think the sky is the limit for Chelle, and that she can continue to be on the cutting edge of programming for decades to come, because of her tenacity and her drive and her competitive spirit. She is a brilliant person and our cohort would be sorely lacking wihout her. In fact I would say that any good team needs a Chelle on it, but a Chelle is rare. My only advice for Chelle would be to maybe keep her notebook and pen handy, so she can write down a direction before she steps foot on the path, to make sure it makes sense theoretically before trying to put it into practice.

#### Feedback from Lauren Pesce:
Chelle and I have worked on many projects, and have spend a lot of time together the last few mods. She is always fun to work with and be around because she’s positive and incredibly motivated. She works so hard to create outstanding projects and it shows through her code. Since working on a project with Chelle in Mod 1, I’m so proud of the strides she’s taken to create even better work and having confidence in her code. She’s a great developer and a wonderful person to be friends with.

#### remEMBER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chelletuerk/1610-remember-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

This project focused primarily on git workflow, emphasizing the use of 'cherry-picking'.  This was the first introduction to Ember, the platform used to complete this project.

#### Feedback from Eric Sayler:
Working with Chelle made a tough project (Ember) progress much more easily than I initially expected. Chelle is a great communicator, asks great questions, and has a top notch workflow. She helped motivate us to keep going when we were stuck on problems.  When pairing, she was great at quickly catching mistakes and slowing us down if we were either going too fast or going down some sort of deep rabbit hole.  She also was great at making sure we kept on top of our goals, and helped make sure I didn't get too distracted with unnecessary features/over-engineering. Since Chelle doesn't take things too seriously, and is fun to work with, we were not only productive but also less stressed out overall. During the project, Chelle helped me learn not just technical skills but also more about myself, my workflow, and my habits. I'd definitely work with Chelle again!

#### UX/UI Challenge

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ultimate-ux-ui-team-challenge.html)

This project required a comp design created using Sketch and then trade off to complete another team's comp to be matched exactly using HTML and css.  

#### Feedback from Matt Kaufman:
Working with Chelle was awesome. When we worked together for the UI/UX challenge, she threw together a great design which then I promptly ruined with my less-than-adequate design skills. She's super enjoyable to spend time with, making sure fun is being had no matter the situation. When I worked with Chelle in the past, she was always receptive to help and a great listener! Since working with Chelle in mod1, her confidence in her dev skills has grown exponentially. She's become a great developer which shows itself very clearly in her latest music app. Can't wait to see what awesome shit chelle comes up with in the future!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I found this simplistic approach in viewing homogeneity to be radically impactful.  My takeaways include:
* Slowly, overtime, seeking out others 'like' you grow into a largely segregated group.  Although, seemingly unintentional, it's a daunting reality.

* Diversity quotas are a great way to counteract the 'entropy of segregation'

* Turing manages to raise a passion to counteract this bias where others fail.  It is widely know to be one of Turing foremost ideals and one I've grown to love about my school.

### Module 4 Goals

My longterm goals include securing a fun yet satifying position as a front end software developer, preferably in NYC.  I would like to work primarily with React.js and in a large, busy company that provides opportunities for guidance via a mentor.

Strategy To Achieve Goals:

I see these goals getting accomplished through a small-step process.  I have been applying to development companies in New York, and are targeting large-scale companies that would provide guidance as a junior developer.

I have become increasingly more adamant in the time spent coding.  In fact, it's verging on insanity at this point.  I no longer sleep solo---my laptop is by my side constantly and doesn't snore.  Ultimately, my plan is to avoid any gap in programming between Turing and a job.  I've been very aggressive in my job search and outreach.  In this mod alone, I've connected with over 100 individuals on Linked In, of which 75% I've had back and forth conversation with.  I also have had phone pre-screening interviews for an internship and have been in touch video chatting with the lead of Snapchat in NY.

My focus remains on programming and becoming increasingly more adept in JavaScript and React.

Opportunities Research:

My Trello Board is chalk full of my interactions with connections from California to New York.  I plan to continue to keep in touch with these individuals.

Cold Outreach/Network:

I have made many connections on LinkedIn that I now have a professional relationship with.  I continue to reach out asking questions and sometimes sharing my repos on github.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Eric Sayler:
Eric Sayler is a beast.  You can’t stump this guy.  This doesn’t go without hard work, however.  Eric and I worked on the Ember/Git Workflow project and spent many hours together stumbling our way through this project.  He was always a step ahead of me, but would slow down to make sure I understood the direction we were taking.  His contribution to the tech world will be profound, I have no doubt about that.  I would work with Eric again, any day of any week.

#### Feedback for Dylan Avery:
Working with Dylan on the React Redux project was an experience I will always look back on fondly.  He truly is a secret genius that is rarely acknowledged.  His mind is like a machine that's built for coding.  We struggled though a few unfamiliar parts of the project, but always got back on track, primarily through Dylan's efforts.  I have zero recommendations for improvement.  He takes programming very seriously and will be an amazing asset to any team.

#### Feedback for Lauren Pesce:
Lauren is an enthusiastic individual that has so much to offer!  We worked together on the React Redux movie project and I was witness to her putting in long hours and research to figure out the next best step to take.  I’m proud of our final project and it was a pleasure to work with her.

#### Feedback for Matt Kaufman:
Matt and I worked on the UX/UI Challenge together.  I didn't know just how serious he was about working out until I saw his app.  Truly though, Matt is a machine.  He's clearly one of the most capable developers that have made their way through Turing.  I worked with Matt on many occasions and he's always been overly patient and unbelievably helpful.   I am certain that he's gonna make a serious dent in the tech world, and I'll be there, waiting to catch the runoff.

### Playing a Part

My role in supporting Turing bleeds into everything I do.  I eat, sleep, and breathe code and that is directly related to Turing.  I actually had an Engineer at Pandora reach out to me on LinkedIn asking for my thoughts, as his wife was considering applying.  I have nothing but praise for my school.  I attend Meetups and represent the Turing community and a member that 'shows up' and is proud to be a student at Turing. Lastly, my favorite way that supports Turing as a whole indirectly is attending Demo Nights.  It's amazing to see other students work and how they got there, thanks to Turing.
