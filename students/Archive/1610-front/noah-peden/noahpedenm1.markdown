# Noah Peden - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I felt pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS going into Mod 1 since I studied it a bit over the past year during my free time in Mongolia, but I had zero experience with Javascript and I really wanted to expand my knowledge in that area, especially because that type of logical thinking doesn't come easy to me.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Personal Site

* [GitHub URL](https://noahpeden.github.io)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/personal-site-first-draft.html)

With my personal site I aimed to keep it simple, yet demonstrate my skills in the developer world. I chose a layout that divides my site in two with the left hand side being a static image, and the right hand side having all of my information in succinct bullet points. I haven't made much progress on this since week 3, but over the next two weeks I hope to re-visit the site and start it from scratch in order to write cleaner code, add transitions, and my Mod 1 projects(even those will probably change later). 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Mod 1 included four projects that were all in pairs. I mostly benifitted from the projects in terms of learning Javascript and jQuery, and I enjoyed working with all of my partners. 

## Game-Time

* [GitHub URL](chelletuerk.github.io/game-time/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

We developed the game Frogger with a sort of 90s theme but not too pixelated. In the game we are able to indicate when the game is over or lost, allow the user to start a new game, include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface, and create multiple rounds of difficulty. 

### Functional Expectations
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
### User Interface
* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
### Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
**2.5**
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
### JavaScript Style
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### Workflow
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
### Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
* 4 - Zero complaints

Feedback from Chelle:
Noah was an exceptional example of the type of individual to be paired with on a project.  He puts in long hours, showing a 
true dedication to a final product we are both proud of.  Additionally, he takes programming very seriously and is determined 
in finding a solution, which was clearly illustrated by his devoted manner in which he attacks a complicated problem.  I look 
forward to working more with Noah and am grateful to have been partnered with him for the game-time project.


## Idea Box
* [GitHub URL](https://noahpeden.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Group Members: Jon / Noah
##### Evaluator(s): Louisa

In this project, I used JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions, and JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions when submitting ideas on a page.


###Feedback from Louisa
###Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

####JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

###Collaboration

2.5 - paired in person, didn't communicate through GH because they were pairing together. Missed opportunity to practice GH workflow.

####Feedback from Jon:
I had a great time working with you on idea- box, "a box for your ideas. " I like how you took charge on the html so we could get right to work on our javascript. We needed that extra day, considering we were at Gusto until 12:30 the night before it was due. I think we struggled with local storage, but that was expected. It was definitely fun working with you!

## Linked List
* [GitHub URL](https://noahpeden.github.io/linked_list/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### Group Members: Bekah / Noah
##### Evaluator(s): Louisa

This application includes two input fields for bookmarking a title and URL, a section for displaying the bookmarks, a submission button for creating the bookmarks, a delete button for removing the bookmarks, and a mark as read button.


###Feedback from Louisa
### Specification Adherence

### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
Fundamental JavaScript Style
 3.5

### Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style
3.5	- some small structural adjustments would make for more robust and semantic HTML. Overall well done, could have used one last fine-tuning pass.


### CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

####Feedback from Bekah:
Noah- I am so glad we got to be partners this mod! You were positive and confident the entire time, which made working on a tough project a lot easier. I was impressed by your knowledge of the subject and the hard work you were willing to put in. You would stay late every night when we needed it, even though you have a long trek home. My only constructive criticism is that you get very attached to something and want to work on it until it is figured out, and by doing that while we were pairing, it made us less of a team. (of course this is where your constructive criticism for me comes in, I should have spoken up!) We did really well on this project and I am happy with the result! I always enjoy your positivity and friendship, thanks for such a great partnership!


## Number Guesser
* [GitHub URL](https://noahpeden.github.io/number_guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

##### Group Members: Mike / Noah
##### Evaluator(s): Louisa

This project includes an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, clearing the input field, reseting the game to its initial state, an element that displays the users most recent guess, and an element that displays a message to user.


###Feedback from Louisa

###Specification Adherence

###UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

###Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

###Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####Feedback from Mike:
Thank you for being an awesome partner on Number Guesser! The communication upfront was solid and it seemed like we could be pretty candid on any issues or disagreements we had as the project moved along. I especially appreciated you taking lead on the design aspects. I know we had some struggles pair coding the javascript (which I mostly chalk up to the light bulbs going off at different times for both of us) but feel like we both were able to grasp it by the end. My recommendation on future projects would be to keep doing what you’re doing in asking questions on how things worked, but also take another step to recreate it yourself. Perhaps speaking up more in the pair coding sessions on what you believe should be done and suggestions on how to do it would help. I can get rolling on my own ideas so feel free to speak up more!


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

#####My Notes
Friday October 7th, Citizenship Gear-Up Notes:

Every citizen lives under the Bill of Rights and a Bill of Responsibilities to live up to.

Topic 1:
To Vote or Not to Vote
Reflection Questions
* Describe your attitude toward voting and participating in the US electoral system.
    * I think that voting should be compulsory, as it’s the responsibility of citizens to choose their leaders and representatives. That being said I think there should be more coverage of local officials and representatives than there are today, so I think as a whole, both sides of the coin need more responsibility. The government should require voting, and there should be a system, maybe provided by citizens of better coverage of smaller elections. I also think the electoral system is outdated and a little rigged, and the US should revert to a purely democratic system where your vote counts as your vote, not as a vote for an electoral representative.
* How is the idea of citizenship important to the sustainability of democracy? In your own experience, how might individuals' current attitudes toward voting threaten US democracy?
    * I think that complacent attitudes are the ones that threaten US democracy the most. The worst kind of effect you can have on a democracy is inaction and letting something happen to you. 
* Compare what a citizen needs to do to support democracy against your current attitudes towards civic responsibility and your perception of mainstream attitudes towards voting. How do you reconcile these? What level of involvement is most consist with the values you hold?

####Introversion
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

#####My Notes
* The workplace should create an environment that is more friendly to introverts as they have personality traits that are more rewarding to extrovert teams, where as extrovert leaders bring out the opposite, when they don't let their teammates speak up. 
* It's possible to leverage the advantages of both types of personalities, it's just necessary to keep in mind that every person is different, and even if someone seems extroverted, they might be introverted
* In my opinion it's also necessary for people to be somewhat adaptable, and to not closet people into one personality or the other. Like me I feel like I'm somewhere in between introvert and extrovert. And I feel like it's a part of my responsibility to the workplace to adapt to difficult situations when necessary even when it's not entirely comfortable.  

####Resiliency
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

#####My Notes
* When you first read the title of this GearUp, what were your initial reactions? What experiences have you had that shaped your attitude toward the topic?
    * My initial reactions were that it was super relevant to what is happening at Turing, I can be stuck on a problem for hours or even days and have to be resilient enough to keep at it and keep a positive attitude about it or else I’m never going to have the energy to solve the problem. Being in Peace Corps in Mongolia definitely shaped my attitude towards resiliency and I think basically created my resilient attitude. I feel now like Turing is sharpening and honing that resiliency. 
* What did you learn from reading the article? Did this change or affirm any attitudes and beliefs you hold?
    * It affirmed basically my beliefs towards resiliency, mostly about how some stressors can either over power a person, or how resiliency can prove strong enough to overcome that challenge. 
* What value do you put on personal resilience? Why?
    * I place a very high value on it. I think resiliency is one of the biggest factors that contributes in the success of a person in general. How else can someone overcome a huge challenge or stress in life?
* Consider Josh Spodek's premise that knowing about resilience is different than becoming more resilient. Identify 3 mental practices and behaviors that constitute resilience skills.

* What level of value do you place on resilience? Why is this important to you (or not)?
    * 10/10 - 
* How will resilience affect your career as a programmer? Why would employers value employee resilience?
* What can you do to practice resilience? 
    * Having a short memory, learning from challenges.  Doing something that takes you out of the situation and can still accomplish something.
* How can we support each other develop resilience at Turing?
    * Stay positive. 



### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding I

Who are you? How did you get here? Learning how to tell your story is important for successfully conveying how you’ll contribute to a team. Think about how you’d like to contribute your prior experience and career to the tech community. How would you like to use your skills as a software developer? In this workshop, we’ll discuss how to tell your story through different channels -- software teams, resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github -- and how these tie together to support your job search.

[Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)

#####My Notes
* "perception is reality"
* Tell a consistent story, building on the details with each profile.
* Who are you?
* How did you get here? Why?
* What's Next?
* Turing Shouldn't be main focus of story
* Choose the right channels
* 	Dont use resume as crutch
*  LinkedIn is awesome
*  Brand Yourself - Software Developer NOT full stack or engineer


####Learning to Pair

Building on your abilities to explain your strengths and aspirations in Personal Branding, Learning to Pair provides you with tools to be successful in pair programming. At Turing, we emphasize pair and team programming as it is an industry norm. In this session, you'll learn how to communicate with each other and define your working relationships with pairs, discuss strategies for how to hold each other accountable to these expectations, and how to address broken expectations. Understanding how to successfully work in teams is crucial to being a successful developer.

[Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

#####My Notes
* Should do DTR for every pairing
* Define your strengths
* What do your expectations look like?
* Appreciate in person or slack commmunication, I don't like emails
* Clearly defined goals and work loads for each person is very important
* Mod1 Fallacy: partner is better than me OR holding me back
* How to fix reactions
* ready for conversation
* establish safety
* ask for permission
* speak in private
* describe what's happened
* ask other person's side
* Listen to other side


####Feedback I

In this session, we'll continue building competencies in pairing by discussing and creating a feedback loop. Giving and receiving feedback effectively is difficult -- emotions run high and it can be hard to process what's said. Discussing our possible triggers to feedback is the first step in raising awareness of these reactions when they're happening. Following that, we'll dive into the three types of feedback, when they're needed, and how to solicit them. We'll discuss a framework for how to successfully have a feedback conversation, culminating in an understanding of how to move forward with your personal improvement.

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

#####My Notes
* Know that they're not attacking your character
* Cultivate a growth identity
* Always step back and look at relationship
* 3 types of feedback: appreciation, coaching, evaluation

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####To Mike:
Thank you for working your butt off until midnight every night to get the Javascript for the first couple of phases nailed down and being understanding of my long commute. Also thank you for taking the time to explain all the Javascript to me and being willing to let me build and work through stuff. I would definitely not understand Javascript like I do now without your patience and help. I also appreciate you taking a step back and realizing the deadlines were getting to you. I feel like early on there were times you were frustrated with my understanding of Javascript, but as the project went on you explained things and I was able to get on the same page and the frustration abated. Maybe in the future (we discussed this already as well) is you can plan on deliverables for the next day and attack it separately, then explain what you each have done. Overall I think our project was awesome compared to others and thanks for being a kickass teammate.

####To Bekah:
Overall you were a great partner to work with not only because you're a nice person and excellent team member, but because your willingness to learn and work equally contributed immensely to the success of our project. Without your work on the CSS and jQuery we would not have been able to deliver a viable product. My only constructive criticism would be to speak up more if you want to take control of the coding or want to struggle through something without your partner just taking over(like I did... I think). Honestly though, this was one of my favorite projects because it was so easy to work with you and plan out our goals. Thanks!!

####To Jon:
Wow, that was a difficult project. I think localStorage really prooved to be be one of the biggest struggles for the both of us and I am very grateful that you were willing to re-write our entire JS file until 1am the night before our Eval. I am also grateful for you taking charge on CSS and your portion of the jQuery when you stepped back to try and get a better handle on it. I don't really have any constructive criticism since you and I both struggled in the same places and the light flickered on at the same time. Maybe next time (and this goes for me too), just research what the main thing is going to be, and be more willing to start from scratch if something isn't working. Cause as Jeff says, our code ain't worth sh*t.

####To Chelle:
I was worried before we were assigned partners about who I was going to get for a two week project partner, but it turns out my worries were for naught as I got you as my partner!! I am grateful for your abilities to quickly grasp and tackle difficult concepts/problems and willingness to put in late nights so that we can accomplish what is needed. I am also a huge fan of your humor, ability to listen to my side, and styling skills. My only constructive criticism would be to plan out your path to a Minimal Viable Product and really stick to that before adding on extra features or things. Overall you were a pleasure to work with and I don't think our game would've turned out half as well as it did without you. Thanks for rocking!!

### Being a Community Member

####From Justin:
I did not get a chance to actually be paired with Noah on a project, but we have spent a lot of time this module coding 
together. Working with Noah is always fun, light-hearted, and enjoyable. He works hard and is always willing to put in the
time to learn something new. While working with Noah on his projects, I've noticed that not only is he a fast learner but 
also a great team member. I envy his communication skills and the charasmatic vibe he brings to every situation. I 
genuinely look forward to the day we get to actually pair on a project for class.

####From Bekah:
In the time that Noah and I spent together outside of our linked list project, we had gotten to know each other very well. He has an awesome and bubbly personality and brings happiness and laughs to class everyday. I absolutely love spending time with Noah, he is incredibly good at what he does, and is always willing to take time out of his day to help you with anything and everything. Noah is caring and compassionate about the people around him, and it shows everyday with his actions. He is simply a wonderful addition to our class, he’s an outstanding partner and a great friend.

### Playing a Part

* Through doing the StrengthsFinder quiz and talks with Allison I think I might have more strengths that play to being a programmer than I thought I had. This combined with my check in with Bree and the past two years I spent as a teacher, I would love to start to bring in younger people such as my siblings to show them how awesome coding is along with what Turing has to offer. In the future I would love to be a part of GDI as a TA if Bree and Louisa allow it and maybe even at Try Turing Weekend. 
* I wipe down the Gusto fridges every Tuesday with a zeal rarely matched.
