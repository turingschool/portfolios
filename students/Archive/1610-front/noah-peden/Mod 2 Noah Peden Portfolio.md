# (Noah Peden) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I set out to learn React which I was super excited about given it's kind of a newer JS library and it was created by Facebook. I feel like React didn't really start clicking for me until the last two-three weeks, which was when I was really able to write code and break things out into components super easily. What I need to do moving on is focus more on becoming an object oriented programmer and dealing with objects and arrays.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

(In this application, the user can input a minimum and maximum number where a random number is then automatically generated. The user can guess numbers in between the minimum and maximum and the application will give feedback on whether you guess is too high or too low from the random number generated. Once you win, the application will reset to its original state.
)

Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental JavaScript/React Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
This mod's projects focused on coding in React, object oriented programming, and asynchronous code. We had a refactor of IdeaBox into ES6, Weathrly which had an option to do yourself, Shoot the Breeze which was a chat app utilizing Firebase, and we constructed a Fancy List which had multiple tasks mapping to the DOM which allowed you to mark tasks as different types, add sublists, and persist per user.


#### (2Do Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noahpeden/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Accessibility
3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.
User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
JavaScript Style
3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Utilization of es6
2.5 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.
Testing
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Feedback

Feedback from Kenia: Noah, I really enjoyed working with you on our 2DoBox app. You showed a really great understanding in ES6 and problem solving. I think we really became comfortable with working remotely and improved our workflow. You're great attitude made it easy to get through the more stressful parts of our project and tackle some of our more difficult challenges. I look forward to working with you in the future!

#### (Weathrly)

#### Summary
This project was a somewhat self directed project where you have to call a fake API and display weather based on inputs using React.

### Feedback

From Elijah- You were a lot of fun to work with on both of our projects.  It was great to see how much you progressed in React from when we first started working on Weathrly until we finished Shoot the Breeze.  I’d encourage you to break apart code into small bits and focus on understanding it in detail.  Give yourself time to solve problems yourself before reaching out to others.  You were an awesome partner!  Looking forward to continuing working with you!

### Feedback
From Lauren:
I’m always happy to work with Noah. He has the best attitude and is always willing to help. He has helped me out on other occasions and always has a positive attitude. I admire the way Noah is willing to stop and ask questions until he fully understands a problem before we keep working. He is willing to work hard on a project and was flexible when it came to work time and pairing. I’d love to work with Noah again. 

From Dan:
Noah, your humor kept us going through some dark places sunday. bless. I'd suggest you focus on checking error messages if something goes wrong, and only changing one thing at a time when troubleshooting things. I think it'll benefit you greatly to be able to break things down to one line or one character and debug from that. Keep cranking fam! 

## Professional Development
(We had five PD workshops this mod: Finding Opportunities, Feedback, AGILE practices, Cold Outreach and Networking)

### Professional Development Workshops

### Finding Opportunities

[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEmFYs-tioG-TIy4aRC1qufcEC54k-3tm9C-VImiJDM/edit#gid=0)
Looking for jobs on sites like Monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. Instead you should focus on reaching out and getting a job through contacts. Set up information interviews to get your foot in the door.

### Agiles Practices & Project Management (FEE)

I use agile practices with each of my projects. As a DTR in each group, we discuss the best way to use agile practice so have the most success with our project. I make sure when working a specific functionality, we test, make it work, style, refactor, and add accessibility.

I use google docs and mac notes to organize the tasks we need to get done and break up different functions of each individual in the group to work on.  I have found that if everyone in the group uses notes or google docs and communicates consistently with each other about agile practices, we are able to make a very good project productively. Things go wrong when people don't communicate well about what files they are working on and when they are merging things into the master.

###Feedback II

Through communication in a project, I try to feel out what everyone is working on, their stress level, and what they are comfortable with. I also try encourage everyone to keep open communication about when working on a function. Through feedback I have found that I can sometime work at a slower pace than others and I need to take step back, focus in on the problem, and take time for myself before reaching out to someone for help. 

### Cold Outreach

##### Synopsis:
Kelly Port at WellTok: I emailed her in December asking if she'd like to meet to tell me more about her job and WellTok after meeting her at the Alamo theater and her giving me her contact info. No response yet, will call or email in the next two weeks.

Andrew Joynt at n.io: I emailed the info account at n.io after seeing they had a front end engineering position open on LinkedIn and Andrew emailed me back saying to get in contact with him in a couple months. Emailed again to set up informational interview in January or February.

George Murnock at Salesforce: I messaged him asking if he'd like to meet in January to talk about being an engineer at a big company like Salesforce. I connected with him by saying that I've loved using Salesforce in the past at my jobs in study abroad.

Jason Roberts at 303 Software: On my way to Michigan over the holidays I met a lawyer who connected me with Jason Roberts on LinkedIn. I messaged him, and replied back with his email address and we are going to set up a time to meet for coffee or beer in January.

Ian Behrmann at Layer 3 TV: I sent him a message asking if he'd like to meet up in January to talk about working at a successful start up like Layer 3.

Lucas at SendGrid: Sent him a message after seeing he has also graduated from Turing and asked if he could meet up in January to talk about what it's like as a Turing grad to work for a big start up like SendGrid.

Matt Frey at Full Contact: Sent him a message after discovering that Full Contact is one of my top companies based on their amazing benefits package for employees. He accepted my invitation on LinkedIn but has yet to respond about meeting.

Kelly at Ibotta: Sent her a message asking to meet sometime in January to talk about being a mobile(android) engineer at Ibotta.

So far I have reached out to 8 people, and set up information interviews with 2 people. My mentor is also going to introduce me to a couple more people at startups around denver.

### Networking

Over the break I plan on attending a React meetup, and a couple other networking ones on UX and Front End stuff.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Kenia - Kenia was an excellent partner for our first project of module 2. Her calm work ethic helped us through a time crunch towards the end, and her knowledge of ES6 and dedication to studying definitely showed. I would encourage her in the future to speak up more when it comes to being the person in the pair not coding. She has an excellent knowledge of JS and should show it. I'm looking forward to working with her in the future!

Elijah - I wouldn't have chosen anyone else to be paired with on two projects in a row. You were flexible and had a good handle for how much stress was on me and the both of us. I actually don't have any criticisms for you, it was a pleasure the whole way through. Thanks!

Dan - Thanks for being a great partner and carrying the team through with your knowledge of object oriented programming and trying to let others drive occasionally. I would suggest that before you take someone's code and completely refactor you make sure you ask them if that's ok and completely explain what you're about to do and why you think it's important.  Thanks again for driving us through a four day grind and I look forward to working with you more!

Lauren - With most project partners you can’t really tell how competent they are, or what their work ethic is until it’s too late. Lauren is not only incredibly competent, but stuff doesn’t faze her until it’s figured out, and you can tell immediately.  She single handedly figured out like 20 million problems when it came to testing in React. So beyond being intelligent, she was an awesome friend to work with and I basically have zero criticisms. 10/10 would project pair again.

### Being a Community Member

From Marissa Reinke in 1611 FE: 
Noah was an excellent person to pair with. He is very knowledgeable and always made me work for the answer instead of just laying it out in front of me. On top of that he also has a very positive attitude, which made it extremely easy to work alongside him and leave feeling less stressed out!


### Playing a Part
At the beginning of the mod I was nominated for SAB. In SAB I've advocated for our cohort and pass out surveys which I then hand on to Allison. I also contacted Lia to see if my father, Troy Peden, would be a good candidate to be a guest speaker, and he is now on track to speak sometime in the coming months.

### Gear Up

####Microaggressions:
* What are some takeaways from the articles?
    * Microaggressions usually don’t come from a place of malice but can still cause harm
    * they occur very frequently
    * maybe one alone doesn’t seem like a lot, but taken together it’d become very tiring
    * Is there anything that we can really do besides just keep enforcing the fact that usually stereotyping is a bad thing? I mean if people understand that stereotypes are becoming more and more harmful, then comments that exhibit microaggression will probably drop in frequency.
* How does this information change or reinforce what you thought about the topic of microaggressions at the outset of this session?
    * It reinforced my thoughts that mostly white people commit micro aggressions, but it also made me realize when I’ve been the victim of micro aggressions, especially when I’ve traveled abroad and I’ve been the minority. “Well all americans are fat, well all american men are rich, all americans are lazy and messy, etc…”
* What questions do you still have about this topic and how it relates to your life?
    * None really, I just think that instead of trying to confront how people speak, the root of the cause should be attacked, like how can we reinforce the fact that people just shouldn’t stereotype, and that everyone has an equal chance to be great.

#### Journey Mapping
My pair in this Gear Up mapped through getting a new drivers license at the DMV. It was helpful to pinpoint potential problems in the process of doing something and I can definitely see how Journey Mapping is an essential process when it comes to planning a project or product.

####Grit
Grit is the perfect combination of passion and perserverence when faced with a challenge or a project that requires endurance. Instead of being slapped in the face by a problem, bulldoze through it, garner that attitude of growth. Take feedback and learn from it. A challenge isn't a failure, it's an opportunity to grow and learn.
