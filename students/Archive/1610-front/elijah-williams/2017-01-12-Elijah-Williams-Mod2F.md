Mod1's Number Guess game built using React

#### Instructor: Jhun

#### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

* 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## C: Group Work & Projects

There were four projects in Module 2.  Note that Weathrly was not graded.

## ToDo Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/sljohnson32/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

This was a refactor of a mod1 project that gave us exposure to SCSS and ES6.

#### Instructor: Jhun

#### Comments:

code is structured really well
loved the closures
could refactor some code using loops and passing in more arguments

#### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Accessibility

* 4: The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

#### User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### JavaScript Style

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### Utilization of es6

* 2: Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.

#### Testing

* 3.5: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Feedback

##### Sam Johnson 

I thought you were a great partner to work with.  I think we did a good job breaking down a lot of challenging problems - as a team and, in some cases, individually - and I’d be excited to dig into another challenge/project with you again. I think you have great optimism and set a good tone in group work and my only real feedback is just to say that and to encourage you to continue to use that strength at the Turing community.

## Weathrly (ungraded)

* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noahpeden/weathrly)
 
This was an ungraded project to give us a first taste of APIs and React.  
 
#### Feedback

##### Noah Peden

I wouldn't have chosen anyone else to be paired with on two projects in a row. You were flexible and had a good handle for how much stress was on me and the both of us. I actually don't have any criticisms for you, it was a pleasure the whole way through. Thanks!
 
## Shoot-the-breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ejwill04/shoot-the-breeze)

Comp Changes

'Shoot Thou Breeze'

'December 21st' vs 'December 21'

Mobile View

Remove the title
Dates should be 12/21 style

#### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Component Architecture

* 3.5: Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

#### User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Fire-Bae (Budget App)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)
* [Github URL] (https://github.com/JeffBuss/smart-budget)

This was the final mod2 project where we had a chance to continue using React and Firebase.  We were given a little mmore room to be creative and design the app ourselves.  We focused on building a budget app that allowed a user to input savings and expenses.

#### Instructor: Meeka

#### Feedback

3.5 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.

## User Interface

3 - Five or fewer complaints

Keep an eye on changing the eslint or jshint rules and leaving comments to disable things.

##### Jeff Buss

Similar to the feedback given to me, I would consider Elijah one of the most dependable, stable, and level-headed people I've paired w/ at Turing thus far. It's always a pleasure to work with someone who doesn't get unnecessarily upset when something doesn't work. That's literally our job at this point - fixing broken shit lol :) Elijah is able to keep his cool despite incredibly frustrating issues arising, which is a crucial trait in this field. Sometimes this can lead to mild complacency  and an "everything is fine, I'm cool with whatever" attitude (for lack of a better way to put it), but when need be Elijah always will speak his mind.

##### Chelle Tuerk

Elijah is a centered, smart, and hard-working guy.  He tackles difficult concepts and works until they’re finished.  I appreciate the thorough discussion involved in each step of the process, and he doesn’t agree to something unless it makes sense.  Our project was a stressful, time-restricted undertaking and Elijah never cut any corners.

## D: Professional Skills

Professional Development Workshops:

#### Cold Outreach
 
 * [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)
 
It was nice to put together an email to use for cold outreach.
 
#### Networking
 
 * [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)
 
It was a good chance to work on networking with the mod2 back-end students.
 
#### Agile
 
 * [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)
 
It was nice to find out more about agile devlopment, though I wish we would have dove in deeper.  I felt the breakout portion could be reorganized.  
 
#### Johari-Window
 
 * [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)

[Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/Z3QKUgH3/elijah-williams-job-tracker)

This session allowed me to pull away from my studies and begin thinking about what type of companies I want to work for once I finish Turing.  It also gave me some leads into the companies I'm intersted in joining.
 
## E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Noah Peden

You were a lot of fun to work with on both of our projects.  It was great to see how much you progressed in React from when we first started working on Weathrly until we finished Shoot the Breeze.  I’d encourage you to break apart code into small bits and focus on understanding it in detail.  Give yourself time to solve problems yourself before reaching out to others.  You were an awesome partner!  Looking forward to continuing working with you!

#### Jeff Buss

You did a great job on the budget app.  You were dependable and always came back with something that worked well.  Focus on ripping apart code you’ve written and finding other ways of doing it.  I think it will help you be more proficient at syntax and problem solving.  All in, it was awesome to work with you.

#### Sam Johnson

You were an awesome partner.  You were component, dependable and did a great job communicating.  Don’t be afraid to step away from a problem when it’s proving challenging.  I’d be glad to work with you again.  Keep it up.

#### Chelle Tuerk

It was great working on the budget app with you.  You showed a ton of grit and delivered some awesome code.  Make sure you’re focused on understanding all of your code and take time to refactor.  Break down your code into simple steps that you feel comfortable executing.  Keep up the awesome work!

## Being a Community Member:

#### Daniel Bucket

Even when you weren't 'available', technically speaking, you were willing to help  solve some issues simply because you were willing to spare a few minutes. I think that's what all this community what-not is all about and I was happy to witness it first hand.

## Gear Up

#### MicroAggressions
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
 
As a Hispanic-American who grew up in one of the poorest areas of the United States, I came away from this talk reflecting on the multitude of microaggressions that are frequently pushed my way.  I also reflected on how despite this, we must push to love each other despite our flaws.  
 
#### Journey Mapping
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)
 
It was good to think through the process of how a user might access something.
 
#### Grit
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit is something we build up.  As such, it can be 'worn down' and result in us giving us.  My own grit can be problematic if not monitored. I have a tendancy to keep pushing until I either burn out or put myself in positions I don't want to be in because I just kept pushing (i.e. pushing on something that won't move resulting in me missing deadlines')

I identified three ways to develop a growth mindset that will help when my grit is low: 

 1. Focus on learning and not what the project will look like
 2. Realize that my success in this program won't define me
 3. Realize that this project is just preparing me to work with new teammates, deliever a project, and learn cool stuff

### Playing a Part

I kept several timeslots available to pair with mod1 students each week.  It was always great to get a chance to work with them on their projects and assignments.  Additionally, I tried to always make myself available to help anyone around me.  

### Personal Reflection Based on Feedback

After getting feedback last mod that I should take more time to do things outside of Turing, I put that to practice this mod.  I found that I was far less stressed and still managed to deliever good work.   

### Project Management
 
I pushed to use Waffle on all of our projects this mod.  I found it to be a great project management tool.  I tried to make sure I was always communicating over Slack to keep everyone connected.  The one area I'd like to improve is making sure work is explicitly assigned so there isn't anything left floating.
  
# Final Review

It's a pass!

## Notes

Jhun: I would like to see you take on a little more ownership for the community. The pairing slot is a great start, as you move into the senior role - it would be great to see you build ways to make the community even greater.
