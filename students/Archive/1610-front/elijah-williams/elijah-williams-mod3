## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

There were two individual projects in Mod3 - Chuck Norris and the self-directed project

#### Chuck Norris

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ejwill04/texas-ranger-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

The Chuck Norris project was a solo project where we had a chance to work with React, Router, and hit a RESTful API.

Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing 2+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### Newmann (Self-directed project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ejwill04/self-directed-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Newmann was a solo project designed to allow users to select a company and leave comments about the company.  The project used React, Router, Redux, and Mongo.

##### Feature Delivery

Completion

- 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

Organization

- 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

##### Technical Quality

Test-Driven Development

- 2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

Code Quality

- 3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

##### Product Experience

User Experience

- 2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX. Search fixed. Sign up & Login page

Performance

- 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were two group projects in Mod3 - Movie Tracker and Remember.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ejwill04/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)

This project focused on using React, Router, Redux, and hitting a RESTful API.

MOVIE SPEC:

Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
Specification Adherence

3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### feedback to me

##### Adam Rice:

Working with Elijah during the Movie Tracker project was great. Elijah is very good at problem solving independently as well as with a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and encouraged our group to add unique features such as the single movie card for each movie. The quality that I admire most about Elijah is his ability to focus his attention fully to one issue and not get distracted until he has resolved that issue. Regarding areas of improvement Elijah could get more familiar with testing a React & Redux application. I am very glad that I got to partner with Elijah during this mod.

##### remEMBER

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1610-remember-6)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

This project focused on using Ember.  The project as pass/fail and they're wasn't a final check-in.

#### feedback to me

##### Dan Grund: 

Elijah and I collaborated on the Ember project. I respect his ability to search through docs and StackOverFlow to find solutions to problems, and his ability to resolve merge conflicts. also great at leaving PR comments. and at being patient. and writing tests. all around solid dev.


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### (Tragedy of the Commons)
 
 * [Github URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
 
 I thought the PotP was a really powerful example of the role we can all play by trying to be more inclusive.
 
 
#### (automation)
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown))
 
I think the change that automation can be exciting but its effect on us and society as a whole will be dictated by how we decide to use it.  
 
 
#### (basic income)
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
 
I like the idea of UBI, but I'm not sure if we are in a place where it's necessitated.  The research that was presented in the discussion seemed to be lacking, so I think we should spend more time trying to understand what UBI might look like and what effects it could have on society.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Dan Grund: 

Dan was a great person to work with on Remember.  He was confident in his abilities and had no problem figuring out solutions when coding issues would arise.  He was efficient but maintained a high attention to detail.  One area I would challenge him in is to make sure he’s keeping an even pace throughout the project  All in, he was a solid partner and a great developer.

#### Eric Sayler: 

Eric was a great partner on Movie Tracker.  He is well versed in the material and puts in the time to figure problems out.  Having paired with Eric in Mod1 as well, I’ve seen his abilities as a partner and teacher increase drastically.  It made working on this project really exciting.  The area I would challenge Eric in is to consider how he could make his code more organized and easier to read.  All in, Eric was a tremendous partner.

#### Adam Rice: 

Adam was great to work with on Movie Tracker.  He was well organized, confident in his abilities and delivered on all aspects.  The area I would challenge him in is considering how he could be more vocal when pairing  I’ve seen Adam step up tremendously as a developer and community member over the last three mods.  I’d gladly work with him again.

### Playing a Part

I was pretty active with IronFE this mod.  This gave me a chance to work with students from other cohorts and try to build fundamentals together.
