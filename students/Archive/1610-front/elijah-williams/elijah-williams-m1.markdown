-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Notes

Struggled a bit with using event bubbling to listen to both inputs, but got through it no problem with some pairing - should revisit the concept during intermission
JS and jQuery looked great, could use some refactoring into functions, but not quite enough time
Great with communication and workflow

Scores

Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

JavaScript Style

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

Collaboration

4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

See pairing feedback in section E.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I worked on one significant personal project for Module One, which was my personal site.

#### Personal Site

* https://github.com/ejwill04/personal_site

A first draft for a personal site

I received feedback from a designer regarding implementing some more personalized elements into my personal site.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on four significant projects in Module One, Game-Time, Idea-Box, Linked-List, and Number-Guesser.

#### Game-Time!

* https://github.com/ejwill04/frogger

A web game using canvas to play the old-school arcade game Frogger

Functional expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

See pairing feedback in section E.

#### Idea Box

* https://github.com/esayler/idea-box
* https://github.com/ejwill04/idea-box2 //my rebuild of the project

A web application for archiving ideas

Notes

Should be using IDs in HTML for unique elements and sharing classes for CSS styling, HTML was otherwise clean
CSS needed some refactoring since there was some repetition
JavaScript was good, but could use some refactoring into smaller functions
The searching and tag filtering had some unexpected user interaction where tags were selected, but if a search term was added then all of the results would appear regardless of what tags were selected
Using localStorage to search through ideas and hide them; this can be done through the DOM so as not to go through localStorage and risk changing user's data
Could use more conversation in PRs, but git/GitHub workflow looked good otherwise

Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Collaboration

3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

See pairing feedback in section E.

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/jksmall0631/Linked-List
* [Original Assignment]()

A web application to archive URLs

Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

See pairing feedback in section E.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/ejwill04/number_guesser_v2
* [Original Assignment]()

A simple game that challenges the user to guess a number

Specification Adherence

UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations

3.25 - had this for phase 3: Add additional inputs that allows the user to specify what the minimum and maximum numbers should be.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Comments:

they did a really good job, they went and totally refactored it after they built it the first time. JS was clean, reusable, both could speak to all of it. well done.

See pairing feedback in section E.

## D: Professional Skills
I participated in gear ups and resume and personal site workshops.

### Gear Up
#### Resiliency

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown

I enjoyed all of the gear-ups, but I think the one that stuck with me the most was the one on resiliency.  

The resiliency gear-up hit me at the end of Module 1 in the midst of Game-Time.  At that point, I was definitely feeling the stresses of the project.  The gear-up caused me to reflect on my own levels of resiliency.  I definitely came away from the talk thinking about how I could reframe trials in a manner that could make me more resilient.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahwilliams
* https://github.com/ejwill04
* https://resume.creddle.io/resume/99l23ocs1pg
* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/tree/master/module_one

I refactored my LinkedIn and resume after this session.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Bekah Lundy

Hi Bekah! You were a fantastic partner on our first project, and there were a couple of things that really stuck out to me in a positive way.  First, I really appreciated that you always had a positive attitude, even when we restarted our project.  Second, I loved that you weren’t afraid to seek out help when we would get stuck.  

I think you’re in a great place in terms of your knowledge and work ethic, so my challenge to you is to use your position to continually grow as a community member and leader.  Don’t be afraid to share what you’ve accomplished and voice your opinions.  You’re doing great work and bring a lot to the table.  I can’t wait to work with you next mod!

Josh Small

I really enjoyed partnering with you.  I think our project went pretty smoothly and communication was solid.  The thing I would challenge you to do is to become more vocal with sharing your opinions and ways of attacking problems with others in the classroom and during pairing sessions.  Additionally, I agree that we should both focus on taking breaks.  There’s going to be projects that our too big to just attack none stop, and we’ve got to make sure we are building habits that fight off burnout.  Keep it up, man.  I can’t wait to continue working with you.

Eric Sayler

It was great working with you.  I really felt like you knew your stuff, and you were confident at every step.  The area I would challenge you in is code organization and teaching.  I think both of these can go hand-in-hand.  You bring a wealth of knowledge to the table and unique ways of attacking problems, so focus on organizing your code in a way that can be easily verbalized to others.  I really enjoyed learning from you.   Looking forward to working with you next mod!

Breana Knight

I really enjoyed working with you on game-time.  I love how inquisitive you are and how that translates as a partner.  I also greatly appreciated your positive spirit throughout the project.  The area I would challenge you in is to constantly be reviewing and rebuilding your code.  I think as you build that repetition into your work style, you’ll find that the logic and syntax will begin coming more easily.  Keep up the awesome work!  I can’t wait to continue working with you in future mods!

Matt Kaufman

Matt, I paired with you twice during Module 1. Your help was greatly appreciated on both occasions. I think you did a good job of guiding, not giving, during the pairing sessions. I have nothing critical to provide, just wanted to say thanks.

Ian Lancaster

Ian was a fantastic resource on the couple of times I paired with him. He seems to have a great grasp of JS and jQuery and was fully attentive to make sure my questions were answered. On top of this, he gave a great talk on SEO at Spike.

### Being a Community Member

Bekah Lundy

Elijah-  I am so glad we got to be partners this mod. Your passion and hard-working attitude showed every time we worked together.  I am so impressed with how hard you are willing to work in order to finish and understand material! I am very proud of how well we did on our very first project. One thing I may suggest is to take time for yourself if you get stressed out! You are relentless when solving a problem, and sometimes stepping away can really help:) You were a fantastic partner and a great friend, and I look forward to working with you again.

Josh Small

My time working with Elijah on Linked List couldn’t have gone much smoother. We got hung up a couple times but overall did a good job of getting each other out of the sticky spots. One of the things I appreciated and admired most while working with you was your willingness to communicate when you didn’t understand something. This can be a tremendous asset for you and is something I definitely need to work on. Your knowledge concerning the languages used was more than proficient, I feel like we are around the same level and as a result, I felt the distribution of work was perfect. One thing I would suggest, not only for you, but for the both of us is to take more breaks. When you run into a (seemingly) major problem, you have a tendency to not give yourself a break until the task is done. Take a break. Great working with you, man. Hope to do it again soon.

Eric Sayler

I think we really did well with following through with pairing as defined in our DTR, which was good practice for both of us. We were organized and I felt you communicated fairly well throughout the project. A few areas to work on: don’t be afraid to ask questions about ‘why’ during pairing sessions, which both of us could work on. There was a lot of dictation of ‘what’ to do (especially on my side), but not ‘why’ we were doing it. Also, I think you had several great design decisions that I wouldn’t have considered that made the project easier to implement, such as not to use an array within LocalStorage, etc. We paired much more than I have in my other projects which I think was great practice for explaining code changes and learning communication (still something I still need to improve on). One challenge: I would suggest you be more communicative when DTR expectations are broken, such as when I implemented the extensions on my own, which I realize was a mistake since it left you out of the loop on learning new stuff. My fault since I like to ‘solve problems’ when they arise and sometimes can be impatient! Overall, our project was a great learning experience for me since our frequent pairing challenged me to explain what we were doing in a simple and understandable way, a skill I’m planning on continuing to improve on in order to be a more effective partner and tutor to others.

Breana Knight

This was a wonderful learning experience. I appreciated the care and concern you provided as we worked through the project. Taking the time to explain complicated theories. I felt comfortable interjecting my thoughts, opinions, and code snippets. I greatly admire your work ethic. I would hope to work with you again in the future.

### Playing a Part

Within regular Turing time, I participated in Friday spikes and the StrengthsFinder assessment.  Outside of class time, I attended community events such as the event at the Botanical Gardens, the alumni talk, and demo night.
