#####Feedback
"Pairing with Josh was difficult for me. When we started the project I thought we would work well together, but we have very different pairing styles. I frequently felt like I wasn't participating in the project, even if we were sitting right next to each other. I feel like I could have tried harder to engage and push our project along, but I also felt that Josh wanted to work on his own as much as possible. This was frustrating because I wanted to be more active, but I didn't know what direction we were going in. Additionally, I had stated during our DTR that the weekend before our project I would be almost completely unavailable and by the end of Friday we were no where near completing the project. I recognized, too late, that I should have reminded Josh earlier of my commitements. I like Josh as a person, but we aren't the most productive pair."

#####Feedback
"It was a great experience working with Josh on our Shoot the Breeze project. I think we worked well together and enjoyed spending time with him. Josh is hard working and incredibly intelligent. He was able to help me better understand React not only with this project, but other problems I’ve had on different projects as well. He is easy-going and patient, and we were able to create a successful project."

#####Feedback
Adam - "Working with Josh Small during the final project of mod two was great. Josh is very good at problem solving independently as well as with  a team. I am also glad he is willing to take risks and agreed to try React Native. The quality that I admire most about Josh is his ability to create professional looking applications that have a consistent theme throughout. Regarding areas of improvement Josh seems to dislike revealing his opinion when a decision is being made. He could also benefit from utilizing branches in GitHub and closing Issues via Pull Requests. Josh’s calm demeanor and ability to contribute to every aspect of the project made him an extremely valuable team member."

Justin - "I have no real criticisms for Josh other than maybe voicing opinions or concerns more. But on that note Josh just might not have any concerns to voice. He is one of the most calm and collected people I have ever met which also carries over to pairing and working together on projects. I know he had some reservations about us doing the project in react native but he ended up learning native the fastest out of the three of us. He single handedly put together the nav set up. I also envy his ability to naturally write clean code. His calm presence and skills as a developer are going to take him far."

##Professional Development
A series of classes with the goal of improving outreach, networking, and workplace skills
### Professional Development Workshops
####Finding Opportunities
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/8sCDAbdr/joshua-small-job-thing)
Takeaways: Where to look for jobs/connections and how to approach the initail outreach email.

####Agiles Practices & Project Management
Takeaways: The agile process and how to apply it to the workplace and at Turing

We use agile in our projects on a regular basis, especially with fire-bae. Regularly, our group would come together during the project to figure out what was the best next step and review what we had already done.

###Feedback II
Takeaways: How to communicate effectively in a project and feel out where my team members are. This knowledge allows me to give more constructive feedback.

###Cold Outreach
Takeaways: At this point, I've reached out two four people. One I am meeting tomorrow to have coffee. I plan on doing the other three by tomorrow.

###Networking
Takeaways: Best practices when it comes to networking at events.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
### Giving Feedback
Anna - "I worked with Anna on our first project, ToDo Box Pivot, and I thought it was a success. She seemed to have struggled a bit in mod 1 but upon working with her in mod 2, she seemed to have put in the hours and was really understanding the material. As a result she was willing and able to complete the features she took on. She also did a very good job communicating, not only with her ideas but with explaining me into the project. It took no time at all to sit down with her and get my brain into her code.
One thing I did find a little frustrating was on the final day before the project was due, you weren't able to make it in. I think at some point you mentioned that you had a prior engagement but I didn't remember that until the day of. Another reminder would have been welcome so that we could have made arrangements to complete the project before that last day.
Other than that, solid project. It was a pleasure working with you."

Lauren - "Working with Lauren on Shoot the Breeze was a great experience for me, we created a successful project and had fun doing it. She has a very solid grasp on the concepts and if the rare situation came up that she didn't understand, she made it clear that she didn't understand it. I think this is an incredibly important quality to have as a student at Turing and one that I am trying to work on personally. It was nice to work with someone just as, if not more, goofy than myself. This similarity made a normally difficult project whiz by. Overall, Lauren is a very intelligent and creative person and I thoroughly enjoyed working with her. RIP random color generating word carosel."

Adam - "Fire-bae project was soooo fun to work on with Adam. Honestly, the only difficult thing about working with him was my difficulty judging whether or not he was joking about something. haha Other than that it was a breeze, he knows React back and forth and was able to pick up Native without much effort. He is always willing to help out if I get held up on something or supply comic relief if I get too stressed out about an issue. He also took the role of project manager, in this position he exceeded expectations. He regularly brought the group together to discuss what still needed to be worked on and what was a priority. I think myself and Justin benefitted from this since I have a tendency to just choose a feature and work on it until it is complete. Before this project, me and Adam hadn't spent much time together but I feel like after this project we not only produced a very successful and professional product but a new friendship."

Justin - "I don't think I need to express how talented Justin is as a developer. All of us in mod 2 are aware of Justin's ability to take to a new language. Even if he insists that it's based on the amount of time he spends in front of a computer, he still has a knack for retaining information and just generally understanding computer logic. He was always willing to help out if I got myself into a difficult problem, that is, if you can remove his head from the computer when he is immersed in a particularly difficult issue. I know it can be difficult, I can sometimes have the same issue, but if you could try to tear yourself away from the computer to provide at least a "give me a second" to someone in your group, that would be helpful. Overall great project and I look foreward to working with you in the future."

### Being a Community Member
Marissa Reinke - "Josh was amazing to pair with. He is not only very knowledgeable, but very good at leading the logic without answering the question. This was a huge benefit to have someone to help work through where my logic was incorrect to redirect it to the solution."

### Playing a Part
I attended the welcome 1611 meetup, plenty of pairing, and went to several lunch roulettes to try to meet more back end folks.
