# Joshua Small - M3 Portfolio
 
 ## Areas of Emphasis
 
The main goal of mod 3 was to continue working on the fundamentals. I think in the mad rush to learn as many libraries and frameworks as we can, we lose sight of some of the more important concepts in programming. I attempted to facilitate this with nightly dives into various 'fundamental JS' google searches and by attending IronFE whenever I was capable of getting to school by 8. Otherwise, I came away from our classes and projects with a very solid understanding of Redux and a decent handle on Ember.

## A: End of Module Assessment
 
PASS

## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
### Walker Texas Rangerbox
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jksmall0631/joke-generator)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)
 
A web application created to develop our skills with React and to learn Router. Also had to make calls to an external API.
 
 **Comments:**
 
######Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

######Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

######Design

4 - Developer aligned design completely with provided comps. Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

######Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
 
 
## C: Group Work & Projects
 
### Projects
 
#### Movie-Tracker
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jksmall0631/movie-tracker)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker)
 
 Web application created to learn Redux. Also had to work with a back end created by the instructor to log in and save favorites.
 
Specification Adherence

3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.
 
 
 
 #### remEMBER
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jksmall0631/1610-remember-1)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)
 
 Web application created using Ember. Learned how to work with an MVC. Also had to learn a new style of git workflow.
 
 * Passed
 
 
 #### PERSONAL PROJECT
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jksmall0631/recipe-app)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
 
 Recipe application created in React and Redux. Also utilized a library called Quagga.js to allow scanning of upc codes.
 
 * TBD
 
 
 ## D: Professional Skills
 
 ### Gear Up
 #### Tragedy of the Commons
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
 
 Was absent for this gear up due to cold outreach meetup.
 
 #### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
 
 * Mostly discussed different opinions on what could happen with the approaching increase in automation. Jobs will be lost but humans are resilient enough to be able to cope with this potentially drastic change. Several solutions came up from the opportunity to create jobs in other sectors to UBI.
 
 #### [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
 
 This gear up covered the ins and outs of Universal Basic Income. Much of the discussion was built on the cons of having Universal Basic Income and the possible alternative solutions. Some of these were to put more stringent regulations on how much money one recieves, for example, someone who was clearly putting in an effort to make themselves or their community a better place would be awarded with a higher income.
 
 
 ### Professional Development Workshops
 #### MeetUps
 
 **Event 1: Cracking the Coding Interview**
  * [Workshop URL](https://generalassemb.ly/education/cracking-the-coding-interview/denver)
 
 This event was centered around a panel of speakers from different backgrounds who had experience giving and screening for tech interviews. A series of questions were asked to expose what is looked for in any type of interview, from the first phone call to the technical portion. The event was wrapped up with an unexpected mock technical interview with one of the speakers as the interviewee.
 
 **Event 2: CodePen Denver**
  * [Workshop URL](https://nvite.com/CodePenDenver/ca74)
 
 This meetup was basically just a showcase of the cool things people have done in their codepens.
 
 #### M4 Action Plan
 * [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jksmall0631/b6e579f0470d9881f41aedb09e93cff5)
 
 Learn all the things, get a job.

 ## E: Feedback and Community Participation
 
 ### Giving Feedback
 
####To Steph:
 Steph was fantastic to work with on Movie-Tracker/Not Quite Netflix. I've seen an incredible amount of growth in her in the last few months but she still remains incredibly humble. I think one thing that will be a huge asset to her in the future will be her ability to admit when she doesn't understand something. I've seen a handful of people get in over their head who aren't able to admit to others or themselves that they don't completely understand something (including myself). I don't ever see this being a problem with her. She did a fantastic job contributing to the team and managed to help me through a particularly difficult problem by breaking it down with me over screenhero. Also, that test suite she wrote was bitchin.
 
####To Devin:
 Devin was a terrific asset to our team. I thought we worked well together since we are both fairly flexible people. Very quick to pick up new things, it was easy to get her involved in the code I had been writing and get intelligent and useful suggestions. We paired most days and it was incredibly helpful to be able to bounce things off her to try to negotiate what direction we should take on the project. Overall, very talented and a pleasure to work with.

### Project Teammate Feedback
 
####From Steph:
 
  I am glad we were able to work together this module!  Your dedication/work ethic is impressive- you took it upon yourself to refactor the whole movie tracker in these last weeks!  Also, you helped the whole group get on the same page concerning Redux and whenever Devin and I were stuck, you were there to help us.  I also really appreciate your flexibility and communication- I know you’ve said you prefer working alone, but you were open to and guided a lot of the pairing our group ended up doing. Thanks for being a great team member!
 
####From Devin:

 Josh, it was really great to get to work with you on the movie project. You really championed Redux and made sure that Steph and I understood what was happening and why it was happening in certain places. You worked really hard on making sure we had all functionality done by the time the project was due which was great for team motivation. You’re a very patient person and it was really awesome getting to learn Redux with you.
 
 
### Community Member Feedback
 
####From Marissa:
 
 Josh was amazing to pair with. He is not only very knowledgeable, but very good at leading the logic without answering the question. This was a huge benefit to have someone to help work through where my logic was incorrect to redirect it to the solution.
 
### Being a Community Member
 
#### Personal Reflection
 
 This mod has been a real test for me, a large chunk of the time was devoted to personal projects which made most of us realize where we stand as developers as well as the things we need to work on. Personally, I'm pretty confident when it comes to general logic problems but when it comes to communicating with the proper vocabulary I struggle a bit. My learning style also evades me still to this day. One day I think one mode of learning will be better and the next I pick something up easily in a format that I didn't think I was great with. Overall, starting to feel much more confident in my abilities as a professional developer...
