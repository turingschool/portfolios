# Joshua Small - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal, I'm sure, is probably pretty similar to everyone else's: code my face off for 6 weeks and walk away with a solid foundation on which to build upon during the rest of my time at Turing. This has no doubt been the case. I have learned an obscene amount in this short time. On top of that though I wanted to take advantage of the people and culture of Turing. Being an introvert, this task seemed daunting. I'm not sure if it was the welcoming nature of my classmates/staff or if my efforts were actually successful, but I feel I have more than exceeded my expectations up to this point.

Dan:

"I think we did a bang up job with collaborating on numberguesser.
I appreciate your knowledge and implementation of vanilla javascript and ability to refactor code to read easily.
Glad we figured out how git works, now we'll know to focus on commiting small contributions regularly
so we can track changes to a project in the repository more accurately.
I appreciate your ability to focus on fixing one problem at a time, something I struggle with.
I guess we need to focus on very literal variable names per Bree's evaluation. anyway party on."


#### Linked List

### Feedback To Me

Elijah:

"I really enjoyed partnering with you. I think our project went pretty smoothly and communication was solid. The thing I would challenge you to do is to become more vocal with sharing your opinions and ways of attacking problems with others in the classroom and during pairing sessions. Additionally, I agree that we should both focus on taking breaks. There’s going to be projects that our too big to just attack none stop, and we’ve got to make sure we are building habits that fight off burnout. Keep it up, man. I can’t wait to continue working with you."

### Feedback To Me

Buss:

Very cool-headed and easy-going
Excellent at analyzing problems
Incredibly versatile
Decent communication
Mediocre workflow
"Wait, I got paired w/ Mike AND Josh?!? The Turing gods hath shineth down upon me. Double the partners, double the fun. I was really excited to see I was working with Josh, and was not disappointed in the end result.

Josh has a great brain for problem-solving. Of all the people I paired with, he was the best at looking over at a block of code you were working on and telling you why the hell it wasn't working. He balances solo and group work flawlessly, and always knows which way he's going to accomplish a task best. His cool, calm demeanor was also a huge asset to the group. I see Josh as the most versatile, well-rounded person I paired with this mod. He's also very adaptable, and was happy to take on all of the HTML/CSS since I had handled most of that on the past two projects.

I believe Josh could greatly benefit from putting some time to improving his workflow. Reducing the use of the mouse, learning more keyboard shortcuts, and working on utilizing screen real-estate most effectively could be very beneficial to his studies at Turing. A bit more communication would've been nice as well, but I'm a social butterfly or whatever.

Can't wait to work with Josh again! This time we're going to link the shit out of our javascript file before we start coding."

Mike:

"Great working with you on Idea-Box. It was incredibly helpful to be able to bounce ideas off each other and it seemed like we had a nice pattern going where if one of us got stuck the other stepped up to keep the momentum going. Appreciated you challenging my ideas or making me re-explain things rather than just letting me assume what I said made sense.

My feedback would be to speak up more. Seems like you are getting this stuff down and if you have a thought or disagree with the direction your team is heading you should speak up before it gets too far down the wrong path. Other than that, just keep at it.

Great working with you, hope to get paired up again on future projects. Thanks for the hard work!"


#### Frogger

* [https://github.com/jksmall0631/frogger]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html]()

Web game created to practice html canvas and basic animations

### Feedback To Me

Dylan:

"Working with Josh on Frogger was a really great time. We had a lot of fun and it really didn’t even feel like work most of the time.

Josh is a very focused person who is smart and who gets stuff done. I definitely think his ability to write functions and understand JavaScript is at the top of the class. I never felt like I had to look extra hard for a Bug because Josh was at least equally as skilled when it came to scanning our code and pointing out typos, contextual errors, and anything else that needed refactoring.

Josh also did a great job of staying the course. There were a lot of times where I was just improvising and throwing ideas out there and Josh was always quick to dismiss the ideas that didn’t make sense or that didn’t fit into our theme. I know when Robbie decried our 8Bit art it was hard for Josh to bite his tongue and not yell out “original frogger is our theme!”.

Josh is definitely a great communicator, who can take a leadership role just as easily as he can follow someone else lead. You will never hear Josh complain about anything. “


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown]()

Extroverts seem to have a bit of an advantage in today's society. Schools cater to them, employers value them, and their ability to flourish in social environments generally sets them up for success. Introverts, I learned, are equally important and have the ability to contribute as much as extroverts given the proper avenues to do so. We just need space to think above all else. Turing seems to have taken to this idea and is actively working to make the school a more effective learning place for everyone.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Dan Grund:

The one thing that I appreciated most in working with you was the initiative you brought to the table. For example, coming back from my evaluation to find that 90% of the CSS was already done. Personally, I have difficulty starting into projects and once you got that out of the way I felt much more motivated to get something on the page as well. I also have a tendency to go down a rabbit hole and lose track of the main components that I should be working on rather than the details that I tend to get caught up in. You did a good job of keeping the team (me) on track. From a technology standpoint, you have a very solid grasp on html/css as well as javascript and you were more than willing to help if I ever hit a wall on the JS side of things. I thought we did a great job of communicating and dividing up the work as well. Nice job overall.

Elijah Williams:

My time working with Elijah on Linked List couldn’t have gone much smoother. We got hung up a couple times but overall did a good job of getting each other out of the sticky spots. One of the things I appreciated and admired most while working with you was your willingness to communicate when you didn’t understand something. This can be a tremendous asset for you and is something I definitely need to work on. Your knowledge concerning the languages used was more than proficient, I feel like we are around the same level and as a result, I felt the distribution of work was perfect. One thing I would suggest, not only for you, but for the both of us is to take more breaks. When you run into a (seemingly) major problem, you have a tendency to not give yourself a break until the task is done. Take a break. Great working with you, man. Hope to do it again soon.

Jeff Buss:

My time working with Buss on Ideabox turned out to be very effective. The thing I enjoyed most about our partnership was your flexibility. As a group of three we had to find a way to juggle the limited responsibilities of html, css, and javascript. With you being 'the css wizard’ of 1610, I really appreciated that you were willing to set that aside to allow me to get more comfortable with styling. I know you consider Javascript one of your weak points but I feel you were able to contribute well on that front as well (I’m glad you got that sorting figured out because we weren’t coming close).

I would say to keep chugging with the javascript. You clearly understand the stuff when reading through it but can have difficulty getting started writing. Read books on it, do exercisms, rewrite code. Repetition. Repetition. Repetition. You’ll get it.

Overall, great partner. Would not hesitate to work with you again.

Mike Limberg:

My time working with Mike on Ideabox went exceedingly well. Being someone who doesn’t like to take charge on projects, I figured working with you would be a breeze since you appear to be on the opposite end of that spectrum. I couldn’t have been more right. I think we have a similar way of coding and overall thought processes and that made it much easier to communicate what our thoughts were and translate that into readable and well structured code.

Your ability to effectively communicate and your knack for programming in general will no doubt lead to success in the field. It was a pleasure working with you and hope to work with you again.

Dylan Avery:

Dylan and I ended up working together on the Game Time project. Definitely the hardest project for me to date and I’m glad it was him I worked with for the last two weeks. We had fantastic communication from day 1 and I think that plus a solid understanding of JS and canvas is part of the reason were were able to crank out most of our functionality in week 1. Where he really came through for me though is when we started getting caught up in trying to separate out our logic. A very frustrating time for both of us but he was always willing to offer up encouraging comments to keep up the morale of the team.

I would say productivity is also one of his strong suits. It seemed every time we would stop working together at school, I would log back in to my computer when I got home to find a message that he had just figured out whatever problem we had been working on. Overall a terrific partner. I would be more than happy to work with him again.

Bekah Lundy:

Bekah Lundy is not only a very solid programmer, but a terrific human being. I never had the pleasure of working with her but she was always the first place I would turn for help. Not only technical help regarding code, but help when I’m feeling down in general. I don’t think I have ever had an interaction with her that hasn’t ended with some variation of the the words, “you can do it.” In a program this difficult mentally and emotionally, it’s important to have people like her to provide support to those who need it. She is a huge asset to this class and I look forward to working with her.

### Being a Community Member

Bekah:

"While I didn’t have an opportunity to partner with Josh this module, we got to work together many times. Josh has gone out of his way to help me through multiple code problems. He is someone I can count on to be there supporting me. We often sat down and worked through things together, both bouncing ideas off of each other until we figured something out. Josh is a wonderful addition to our class, I am genuinely excited to be paired with him in the future."

### Playing a Part

During my time at Turing, any time I wasn't pulling my hair out on a project, I was taking advantage of any and all community events.
