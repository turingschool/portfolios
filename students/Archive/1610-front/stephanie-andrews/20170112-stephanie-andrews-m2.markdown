This module we worked on ToDo Box Pivot, Shoot the Breeze, and FireBae.

#### ToDo Box

* https://github.com/chelletuerk/2DoBox-Pivot
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot

ToDo Box is a new and improved version (in ES6) of the IdeaBox that my partner built for Mod1.  

COMMENTS
WTF?! this is some of the best organized code I've seen for this project to date.
small opportunities to clean up small things (filter() instead of forEach())
tests were great!
WTF?!

SCORES
Specification Adherence: 3
  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Accessibility:  4
  The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.Fundamental

User Interface: 4
  The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style: 4
  Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

JavaScript Style: 4
  Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

Utilization of es6: 4
 Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.

Testing: 4
  Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

Workflow:  4  
  The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Feedback from Chelle:
 "Steph is an example of an ideal partner to collaborate on a project.  She’s willing to work long hours, is communicative, and extremely sharp in her thought process.  Additionally, her calm demeanor sets a tone that I look for in every project.  It allows for thorough examination of code and deep understanding.  We put out a quality application that I’m proud of and it would be a pleasure to work with her again.  It might be helpful in the future if you operated as the ‘driver’ a bit more.  You voiced concerns about being unsure of yourself during our project.  It was great working with you!"


#### Shoot the Breeze

* https://github.com/StephanieEA/shoot-the-breeze
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html

Shoot the breeze is a chatroom built with React that utilizes firebase.

Comments:
  The skeleton bones are in place
  would like to see state moved down to other components
  project was incomplete but developers spent time on react

SCORES
Specification Adherence: 2
  The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

Component Architecture: 3  
  Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

User Interface: 1
  The application is confusing or difficult to use.

CSS/Sass Style: 1
  Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of CSS/Sass is doing. Developer writes code with unnecessary selectors or tags which do not increase clarity.

JavaScript Style: 3
  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing: 3
  Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow: 4  
  The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation: 4  
  Zero complaints

Design: 1
  Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices actively detract from the user’s ability to use the application.

Feedback from Kenia:
"Working with Stephanie was a really great experience. We worked remotely through most of this project which really helped us improve our workflow and communication. She really took the lead in this project and was always willing to work late to accomplish our goals. One piece of constructive criticism is to try to step away from problems for a while and take some breaks. I think we worked extremely well as a team and I look forward to working with her in the future!"
-Kenia Farias

#### FireBae

Feedback from my partners:

“I am so glad I got to work with Stephenie this mod. She is such a relaxing prescence, and we really have a lot in common I think, so it was easy for us to take Salt n Pepa video breaks for our Pomedoros, and to just get work done in general. She wrote a remarkable test suite that I will be using for a reference for most of MOD3 probably, and she understand Mocking and Stubbing probably better than anyone in our class. My only advice to Stephenie would be to try and twist arms more when doing group work, and if she has an idea to bring everybody with her and make them do some of the work with her. But I think this will be something Stephenie gets better at the more she figures out how to find the words to describe what she means when writing code. And let me know where the good meditation is at around here!” -Dylan Avery

"I worked on the Budget App with Stephanie. Stephanie was a hard worker, helpful and friendly, and committed to our project.

Stephanie and Dylan and I worked very hard to finish our project. We ran into lots and lots of problems along the way, but Stephanie continued to be positive and strong throughout the entire thing. If Dylan and I got frustrated, she would smile and be excited and motivate us to keep going. She also wrote some killer tests for our project. Stephanie helped make sure that we all took breaks goofed around every once in a while. Stephanie was an awesome person to work with, we had great communication and worked really well together.

The project we worked on together turned out great, and I believe we both learned a lot.  This was definitely one of my favorites! Thank you so much for being such an awesome partner!
...

If I really dig, then I think that the only advice I could give would be to be more open to some ideas. Sometimes we would spend a really long time working on things, and she would get stuck in a hole of furiously working on it, when the other two of us wanted to try a different approach." -Bekah Lundy


## D: Professional Development

### Personal Site
   * https://stephanieea.github.io./
  (I know I need to improve this- I'll continue to work on it.)

### Company Tracker           
  * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gCqKUNi6Fow8SvrLnUyDYhiDeXT-LwLoNL5sqordO-8/edit?usp=sharing

### Cold Outreach:
  I communicated with Meg about satisfying this requirement with drafts of cold outreach emails.  This is a link to my draft document:
  * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VjwyGmoomiv65lgvw3gDaGt4ZSB-B5JAf-aB0qyG0b8/edit?usp=sharing

### Project Management Strategies:
  I was excited to learn how to use waffle for project management.  I think it was helpful with a three person team that we delegated a project manager.  I need to continue to work on utilizing the systems throughout the process (not just setting it up and forgetting about it) and incorporating a timeframe.  A timeframe would improve my pace...

### Incorporating Feedback:
  It's always interesting to see the difference between our perception of ourselves and other people's perceptions of us.  I really appreciated all of the positive feedback I've received and it makes me want to continue showing up.  The only constructive feedback I received from last mod was to drive more often, and I've driven more in every project since and need to continue doing so.  This mod I have gotten more constructive feedback, so I'll be happy to try and implement it more next mod.  

## D: Community

### Gear Up Reflections

#### Microaggresions
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown
My takeaways:
Microaggressions are a real problem.  You can challenge them (which helps reduce their damage) when they happen to you or you see them happen to someone else by asking the aggressor questions.  Questions will clarify the intention.  If the aggressor was making poor assumptions, questions will help him/her realize their assumptions without becoming defensive(hopefully).  Call people in to discussion instead of calling them out.

#### Journey Mapping
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown
My takeaways:
Every aspect of a customer/client interaction is a part of their story about your company/organization.  In an organization, it's important to reflect on the story that you're creating for the people you serve.  It's shockingly easy to be completely out of touch with their experience, so it's important to actively seek feedback.

#### Grit
* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown
My takeaways:
Grit has two key components, of determination and passion.  I, like most of my classmates, had thought about grit as drive/resilience/determination without regard to passion.  To improve my grit with programming, I need to be more connected with and find opportunities to incorporate my passions.  Specifically, I'm passionate about working towards meaningful idealistic goals so I'm thinking about building an app that matches broke students with elders w/spare rooms for my personal project.  It would help the economic challenges the students face and potentially offset the social isolation and loneliness that can affect the elderly.

### Strengthsfinder (Adaptability)
My takeaways:
Adaptability, which can sometimes lead me to be less careful or calculated in my actions, is also what gives me the ability to meet unforeseen challenges.


## E: Feedback

### Contributions to the Community:
I support the larger Turing community by doing my best to maintain helpful communication with staff and students. If I can help my peers or mod1 students with technical skills I try to.  If retros are full of negative comments I mention whatever positives I can think of to keep everything balanced.  Similarly, if a peer is struggling or expressing a lot of negativity I listen or offer possible suggestions, depending on what the situations call for.  I take feedback seriously, and when I give it to staff or students, I consider whether it is accurate, kind, and purposeful(most of the time- there was one time where I wasn't kind on a survey.  I'm sorry about that).  Next module I hope to contribute more by pairing more with incoming students and expressing gratitude more often.

###  Feedback from others
My feedback from the group projects is included in the group projects section.

#### Feedback from Mod1 students
"I remember you were kind and patient with a new student. If you didn't know what I was asking about, you makes it really well with confidence. You were a big help. I'd definetely recommend using you."
-Daniel Ludwick

"Stephanie was a great pairing partner! Her enthusiasm and knowledge was very much appreciated during the session."
-Kyle Zucker

"Stephanie paired with my partner and I during our game time project. You could tell she was eager and happy to help and also had a lot of problem solving skills that we definitely needed for working through our code."
-Marissa Reinke
