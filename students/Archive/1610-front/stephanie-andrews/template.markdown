Number Guesser is a guessing game where the user must guess a number between one and one hundred that was randomly generated by the computer.  We used javascript for functionality and to meet our ux/ui requirements.

#### Game Time

* https://github.com/DanGrund/Game-Time
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

We built Asteroids.  Our player controls a ship with arrow keys.  He/she can shoot bullets to destroy randomly generated asteroids.  The score increases by one every time an asteroid is destroyed.  The player has three lives before the game ends.  The design is intentionally minimal.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

I support the larger Turing community by doing my best to support all of my peers in whatever way I can.  I support the larger Turing community by being an active member of a posse.  Even though I don't have all of the technical skills to be that influential, I helped with a few tasks to get Pahlka's game up and running.  Next module I hope to contribute more by helping everyone coming into mod1.
