Passing

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### UX/UI challenges

My favorite part of these is that they make me laugh...  Seriously though, I learned about pointer events from this duo.  Also, I learned about some subtleties of ux/ui design that I can only describe as non-snapping which I have yet to do but look forward to doing at some point.  I also like watching them debug- it helps me understand not only how working developers think about their bugs but that everyone makes mistakes- which is always heartening.

### Community Connections

UX/UI
	- Cursor to pointer on clickable things
	- Header font should be different than body at the about page.
	- AXE and user friendly color schemes (is this something to improve or something that's good?)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module we worked on the Movie Tracker, Remember, and a UX/UI Challenge.

#### Movie Tracker

* https://github.com/StephanieEA/movie-tracker
* https://github.com/Tman22/movie-tracker

Movie Tracker keeps track of your favorite movies.  

SCORES

Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.

Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Community

### Gear Up Reflections

#### Tragedy of the Commons
* https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown
Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?

There will be less opportunities for women, minorities, working class folks, individuals with disabilities, etc… Those folks that don’t meet the stereotype will have to compete harder, work harder, and fight to receive the same recognition as their white/straight/middle-upper-class male peers


Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
I think that diversity quotas are valuable- if we are not explicitly challenging our biases which we have inherited from society, we stand to reproduce them…  

Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?

If you care you can work to actively decenter white, heteronormative masculinity from your life, your media consumption, your communities, and within your relationships...  If you don't care I try to ask questions...  It's the most effective strategy to get people to question themselves.

PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.

Encouraging students and staff to actively decenter white heteronormative masculinity from our lives...

PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?

I like how they draw you in with a cute game and then lay the harsh truths on you, but they end it with hope and an opportunity to donate.

#### Automation
* https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown)
It's going to happen.  It's okay- I just hope we can do it in a way that is mindful of the workers.  I hated this gear up, not for the topic but for how out of touch I sometimes think people in tech can be.  We talk about problems that are coming, as if there aren't masses of people currently unemployed and underemployed- like poverty isn't a problem.  This community lacks class diversity- I think that's partly why.  Theory's great but economic policies and technology developments have societal effects... and those effects damage real people.  Automation could be an opportunity to stop increasing wealth disparity.  If it's not the companies responsibility (according to my group) and it's the governments, what do we do when the government is already stripping away safety nets, not improving them to deal with the massive unemployment that could come as a result of automation (in part because the benefits of automation go to those at the top, not the workers).  

#### Universal Basic Income
* https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?

The realities of our future economy look grim.  While under Obama, we did have growth, not everyone benefited equitably and income inequality continued to rise.  Under Trump and a Republican Congress, I’m afraid it will become dramatically worse.  Tie increasing automation into that, and things look even worse.  What opportunities will we have- I think it’ll become increasingly important as we face rising poverty levels that people are given the resources to grow their own food and have access to affordable healthcare and education- regardless of income.  That’s the problem that to some extent, a universal basic income, is trying to solve.  

What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?

Who said we have to run the economy this way- in our system it seems like a foregone conclusion because we use money to distribute and allocate resources but what if things were structured another way. Is socialism/communism really so outrageous?  The real questions is how do we deal with our increasing property abundance and our increasing wealth disparity- UBI is only one way.

Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?

UBI is a way of guaranteeing that citizens have some funds regardless of their employment.  While the idea is not new, we are hearing about it now as a way to address the massive unemployment that will result from automation.  Sometimes I get irritated at the tech world- now cause you see it affects you and your job you want to care…  People have been struggling with poverty.  More and more people are feeling the effects of poverty.  More and more people feel like they’re stuck even if they work hard, even if they get the highest education and work hard.  More and more people have lost their jobs or see the end to them coming.  And tech only wants to talk about UBI cause its a solution to some futuristic reality when it is already many peoples reality. The idea isn't new, back in the day feminists talked about it as a solution for the unpaid work of chilcare- not that that perspective doesn't have class problems- I'm just saying, this isn't new...

Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

It’s always good to be informed…  No matter how hopeless you might feel or powerless you might actually be - you'll have the knowledge you need to act right if you get the opportunity.  

## E: Feedback

### Contributions to the Community:
I support the larger Turing community by doing my best to maintain helpful communication with staff and students.  I try to express my appreciation consistently.  If I can help my peers with technical skills or problems I try to.  If retros are full of negative comments I mention whatever positives I can think of to keep everything balanced.  Similarly, if a peer is struggling or expressing a lot of negativity I listen or offer possible suggestions, depending on what the situations call for. I try to never let partners/team members down- I take that responsibility seriously.  I wish I could do more for the community at large and am still trying to figure out how to do that while honoring that I need to take time for myself and my wellness.

###  Feedback from others
For the Movie Tracker:

From Josh:
Steph was fantastic to work with on Movie-Tracker/Not Quite Netflix. I've seen an incredible amount of growth in her in the last few months but she still remains incredibly humble. I think one thing that will be a huge asset to her in the future will be her ability to admit when she doesn't understand something. I've seen a handful of people get in over their head who aren't able to admit to others or themselves that they don't completely understand something (including myself). I don't ever see this being a problem with her. She did a fantastic job contributing to the team and managed to help me through a particularly difficult problem by breaking it down with me over screenhero. Also, that test suite she wrote was bitchin. Great working with you Steph.

From Devin:
Steph, the movie project was stressful for everyone, but your attitude during the whole thing was very calming and it really helped me destress when we kept hitting road blocks. You’re so dedicated to getting problems solved and you work super hard. I was really impressed with all the work you did getting our testing set up and your ability to mock and stub data (which I am terrible at). I can only hope that one day my testing skills are as great as yours :slightly_smiling_face: It was also really cool to work over screen hero. My experience partnering on screen hero in the past wasn't great, but this time around it was super awesome.

For Remember:

From Lauren:
I was really excited to work with Stephanie again after working with her on our very first project in mod 1! Stephanie is always so patient and easy going, but never afraid to speak her mind. The Ember project was intimidating for both of us since it was something very new, but I think Stephanie handled it well and understood Ember more than she knew. We were able to problem solve together, and she was always willing to help me with when I was stuck. Steph is an excellent developer, and I was especially impressed with how well she was able to test our code! Thanks for being a great partner once again, Steph!!

For UX/UI Challege: 

From Noah: 
"Stephanie is a quiet, hard worker, who has a hidden talent for over performing and making everything perfect. Her eye for design really came out during this project and the hard work she put in to the calendar really made our app stand out when we presented. She also is great at open and honest feedback while taking others' opinions into consideration. An awesome partner overall."

###  Feedback to Others

Devin:  The movie project was stressful but I’m glad we were able to work together.  You’re very sharp but humble, which is a rarity at Turing, and makes for a great team-member.  I also really appreciated your ability to articulate your way through problem-solving, something I struggle with and really benefit from hearing.  I also really appreciate your dedication to the project and your work ethic!   Thanks for being a great team member!

Josh:  I am glad we were able to work together this module!  Your dedication/work ethic is impressive- you took it upon yourself to refactor the whole movie tracker in these last weeks!  Also, you helped the whole group get on the same page concerning Redux and whenever Devin and I were stuck, you were there to help us.  I also really appreciate your flexibility and communication- I know you’ve said you prefer working alone, but you were open to and guided a lot of the pairing our group ended up doing.  Thanks for being a great team member!

Lauren:  I am glad we were able to work together again this module!  We’ve come so far since our first project!  I really appreciate your ability to explore new problems and be open minded when it comes to new languages/concepts/frameworks!  In both projects we worked in you’re able to just dive right in!  Thank you for your patience when in pairing when I would get stuck on particular concepts.   Also, thank you for always being there to offer another perspective when I was stuck.  It was a pleasure to work with you again!!!

Noah P:  It was a short and sweet partnership!  Thanks for laying down all of the groundwork for the ux/ui challenge.  Sometimes, getting started can be the most challenging part of a project for me and you immediately saw what needed to be done to get our project up and going!  I really appreciate your attitude,  your humor, and your communication!  I’m glad we were able to work together this module!!

Noah B: Noah has led quite a few Pahlka Spike sessions this module and always does so with enthusiasm and a solid plan of action.  The Twitter Bot Spike was no different and it was easy for me, as a front-end student to follow along- even though it involved Ruby and a lot of necessary set up.  The only thing, that could be improved (and it’s small) is expanding on the written directions.  Overall though, it was a really engaging Spike!
