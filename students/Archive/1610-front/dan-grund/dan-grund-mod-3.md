-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Pass. I can fetch and POST and all sorts of goodness. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Started from the bottom with a react-router joke machine, then went 0-100 on the personal project, for which I created a drum machine and visualizer with react-router and the p5js library.
in between all that we did some UI/UX exercises including creating a sidebar & swipeable cards.

### ChuckNorrisJokeGenerator

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanGrund/ChuckNorrisGenerator)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

For this project, we will be hitting The Internet Chuck Norris Database to access a collection of Chuck Norris jokes with questionable humor, then displaying these using react-router with dynamic routing. 

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

##### Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
2+ - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


## GrooveBox

(evaluation scores)


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built a react-redux weatherApp, an ideabox in Ember, and did a UI/UX spec/execution exercise app.
## Weatherly-Redux

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanGrund/weather-forecast)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

In this project you’ll be building a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page, and work in some cool UX/UI functionality based on sunrise/sunset.

##### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.  

##### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

##### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2:  ALMOST A 2.

##### Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

##### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.  


## remEMBER

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanGrund/1610-remember-6)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

Create a notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality.

Developers will not have commit rights to the master branch. All changes must be made through pull requests that will be reviewed by instructors and merged into master when approved.


## UI/UXercise

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/design-challenge)
*   [Original Assignment]()

this was kind of a stressful afterthought tbh

## D: Professional Skills
We focused on how workplace homogenization and automation are threatening society in various ways. also developed a job search plan. holla. 

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL]()

###### Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available? 
 it will lead to a highly homogenized workplace of about 60% alike individuals. groupthink, meerkat-ing, no innovation.

###### Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
it makes sense. it always has. the only people upset about them are whitey mcWhiterson who can't underachieve any more. 

###### Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
 I believe stripping personal data completely from CVs is a good first step, remote practical interviews, etc.

###### PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
 outside perspective is a cornerstone of innovation. integrate with different communities and social groups to learn from their best practices

###### PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
 PotP is a cool sim designed to showcase how a little social bias goes a long way in creating segregated communities. it is highly effective in demonstrating the point and a starting point of the discussion. 

#### UBI

*   [GitHub URL]()

###### How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation? 
a lot of low and high income jobs will be automated and obsolete. I believe UBI is a bandaid solution to a much larger problem that will occur when a capital-based economy is no longer relevant. the means of production are handled,

###### What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"? 
^

###### Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce? 
UBI is a stop-gap solution to solve the impending unemployment crisis.

###### Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

I think we have to focus on a farther future, figure out what kind of governance/commerce methods society will have to function with once capital is no longer the means of survival.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL]()

###### How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire?
it's going to take a massive effect within the next two decades

###### Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes?
I will be affected later than most as an entrepreneur and developer. 

###### What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue?
awareness is the first step. spread awareness.  

###### What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?
this is a tricky one. awareness is the first step. gear ups similar to this every few mods to make sure you cover the entire student body each churn is key. you can't teach responsibility but awareness helps.

I'm interested in too many things

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Noah P

This is the second project I worked with Noah on. He and Mike organized the file structure and dealt with the brunt of the API calls when setting up the project. He works well with app architecture, but, much like myself, could work on testing skills. 

#### Elijah W

Elijah and I collaborated on the Ember project. I respect his ability to search through docs and stackoverflow to find solutions to problems, and his ability to resolve merge conflicts. also great at leaving PR comments. and at being patient. and writing tests. all around solid dev. 

#### Mike Z

Mike Z, what a champ. stays up late and wakes up early, always troubleshooting bugs and issues. Keeps moral high and the stress low. Possibly sucks at testing, but we have that in common. We'll call that a shared growth opportunity! 

### Being a Community Member

#### Noah P
This is the second project that I worked with Dan on, he's able to play in a team very well and is fine doing the tasks handed out to him by the team, but he could use work on styling.

#### Elijah W
Dan was a great person to work with on Remember.  He was confident in his abilities and had no problem figuring out solutions when coding issues would arise.  He was efficient but maintained a high attention to detail.  One area I would challenge him in is to make sure he’s keeping an even pace throughout the project  All in, he was a solid partner and a great developer.

#### Mike Z
Working with dan on the weather forecast project was great. He made the sadness of learning Redux more fun by implementing a secret code into the app. Dan was always ready to work on the next parts of functionality, and was always ready to help when Noah or I was having any problems with our assigned parts. One important thing I learned from Dan was to "NEVER FORK THE REPO" just clone it down and make a separate repo so making PRs isn't as awful.

### Playing a Part

I make people laugh and try to tell them that they know more than they think they do. gotta keep the moral up when the stress is high u know?
