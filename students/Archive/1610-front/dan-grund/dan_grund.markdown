# Daniel Grund - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I set out to learn html/css basics, and gain a working understanding of
javascript, dom manipulation using jquery, and an grasp of the potential offered
with canvas.

I believe I've learned how to think well logically, but need to drill syntax and
over break to really be prepared for the upcoming modules.

Additionally I will use time during break to work on building an e-commerce site
for a new product I wish to market test, and work with Buss to build new websites
for two local businesses: Crema, and RiNo Yacht Club.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I created a first draft of my personal website, refactored
dog-party, and worked through the css exercises assigned by Louisa. I also
worked through the MDN canvas tutorial to create brick breaker, utilizing objects
instead of their methodology of just drawing everything directly to canvas.

#### (Project Name)

https://github.com/DanGrund/personalsite
first draft of my personal site. single page junkshow that could use a lot of
improvements. my design eval went well though, he liked the simple color choices
and navigation.

https://github.com/DanGrund/BrickBreaker
I worked through the MDN game design tutorial and modified it a bit, using
object constructors for the ball and paddle instead of just drawing everything
directly onto the canvas.

CSS challenges from Louisa, learned about positioning.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module I worked with Josh to create number guesser, Justin on linked list,
Chelle on ideaBox, and Stephanie on Game-Time!

#### (Project Name)

https://github.com/DanGrund/numberGuesser
numberGuesser is an html game where a user tries to guess a number from a range
that is generated randomly. the range grows every round.

UX/UI Expectations
4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.
Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

https://github.com/DanGrund/ideaBox

element to the linked list concept.

Evaluator: Bree

Functional Expectations
4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow
3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Collaboration
3: Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

https://github.com/DanGrund/Game-Time
For the game time project, Stephanie and I endeavored to build a unique take
on Asteroids, Starring the Death Star and a few vengeful planets!
collision detection, and a scoring and lives system.

### Playing a Part
I've made an active effort to interact with the people in our cohort, showing
up to pourtions on fridays, meeting everyone in blakesment every weekend, etc.
I have attended imposter lunch and productivity lunch.

I have not joined a posse, though I have utilized spikes to learn about data
visualization in d3, type choices, best practices for pitching, and a great
introduction to SEO.

I've gone to both improv classes offered, and really enjoyed the speaker from
Captain U. the Tesla speech was alright, felt more like a sales session than a
discussion on technology though. Keavy McMinn was an interesting person with a
fascinating history in development.

Oh, and I made crepes once ðŸ™ƒ
