##Community:

We decided to leave feedback on eachothers linkedIn profiles, seems more effective for the long term! 

### Gear Up
I enjoyed the idea behind this mod's gear up, but I think the format needs refactoring a bit. Our group fell apart between session 2 & 3 due to everybody's different priorities and scheduling, and that definitely showed when we tried to teach the lesson.
