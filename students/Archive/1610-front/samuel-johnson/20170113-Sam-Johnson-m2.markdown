# Sam Johnson- M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to push my skills and confidence as a front end developer and to get more involved in the Turing community. I believe that I have accomplished both goals.  As a developer, I feel very comfortable with React and think it has allowed me to be a big asset to my project partners and to other classmates.  As a Turing community member, I think I have been very involved - both through pairing with Mod1 students and as an active member of the Pahlka Posse.

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Comments:
- would like to see more confidence
- developer got through the challenges would like to see the speed increase just a little more

#### Progression/Completion: 3
#### JavaScript Style: 3.5
#### Workflow: 3
#### Collaboration: 3.5


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I was excited to spend this module really focused on setting a solid foundation for React and think I accomplished that. I spent a lot of individual work time studying different resources around React and taking tutorials through Code Academy. I think, as a result, the final code base for my individual Weatherly project was solid and represented a very solid understanding of React foundations - something that Meeka said she was impressed by during my project assessment.  

I am excited to push myself further in Mod3 to master more of the complex aspects of React and to get comfortable with React Native as well.

### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/Weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

I really enjoyed this project and the opportunity to work independently. It took me a little bit of time to figure out React and working with the API but I think I did that well and my final product was pretty strong.

#### Evaluator: Meeka

#### Comments
N/A

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/number-guesser-react)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

This was our mid-mod assessment - done as a take home exercise. I thought this was a good exercise to keep me in the game during break and as a warm-up for Firebae (which essentially kicked off right after this was done).  While I think there was some room for improvement with regard to my JS/React style, I think the project demonstrated my strong understanding of both.

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Comments
N/A

#### Functional Expectations: 4
#### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style: 3.5


# C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

I really enjoyed learning React this mod.  While I wish I had been able to push my learning a bit more during this time, I think I have a really strong foundation with React and am excited to push myself in the next mod to get much more comfortable with lifecycles, router and working with Firebase and APIs.

### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/2DoBox-Pivot.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

This was a tough project to start after two weeks off.  Both Elijah and I struggled at first to untangle pretty messy code and, after a few days, decided we wanted to try to refactor a large portion of the code base to utilize closures within the main application. This took a bit of setup time but, after that was done, we flew through the other components/features required.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to push myself to learn something new on this project and think it set a good tone for the mod.

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Comments
- code is structured really well
- loved the closures
- could refactor some code using loops and passing in more arguments

##### Specification Adherence: 3
##### Accessibility: 4
##### User Interface: 4
##### HTML Style: 4
##### JavaScript Style: 4
##### Utilization of es6: 2
##### Testing: 3.5
#### Workflow: 4

#### Feedback to Me
From Elijah (partner): You were an awesome partner.  You were component, dependable and did a great job communicating.  My only advice is don’t be afraid to step away from a problem when it’s proving challenging.  Looking forward to working with you in future mods!

### Shoot The Breeze

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/shoot-the-breeze.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/shoot-the-breeze.html)

My first time working with Firebase and I loved it!  This was the first project where I felt like I was building something that was actually somewhat useful - could be pivoted to be a real thing.  I think this is where I also got really comfortable passing properties and effecting state in React.  I felt really good about the finished project and was able to take some of Jhun's recommendations to refactor a bit more and make it even better.  It was also my first time formally deploying a site on Firebase which was cool.

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Comments
This project has been setup really well.
- great opportunites to pull functions out into helpers
- great opportunites to test those helpers
- loved the component's would like to see state moved out of app

#### Specification Adherence: 3
#### Component Architecture: 3.5
#### User Interface:4
#### CSS/Sass Style: 4
#### JavaScript Style: 3.5
#### Testing: 3
##### Workflow: 4
##### Code Sanitation: 4
##### Design: 3


### Feedback for Me
From Devin (my partner): It was really fun getting to work with you on our Shoot the Breeze project. We both like working and researching alone and coming together when we needed to, which for this project worked out well. You definitely understood React better than I did at the start and I appreciate that you always made sure to explain everything you did until it made sense to me. This project really hammered home a lot of the React logic for me and as soon as I started doing my Number Guesser project, I found myself remembering and using similar logic from Shoot the Breeze and it was all thanks to you!

### Firebae (Networker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/networkr.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fire-bae.html)

This was a hard project for me for several reasons.  In general, I think I started off feeling really rushed - due to the time constraints - and, as a result, I think we made some poor design choices up front that caused a lot of issues as our deadline approached.  I'd say this is the first project I've had that wasn't completed/delivered in the way I would have liked it to have been and, for me, as a perfectionist, it kind of stung.  I feel like I learned a lot from the experience - especially with regard to React/JS style and architecture - and I definitely will take that with me for future projects.

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Comments
- solid project given time and lack of 3rd person
- saw some good tests. pretty pumped on that
- state was delegated to other - components which is hard to do

#### Specification Adherence: 3
#### Risk Taking and Creativity: 3.5
#### Design: 3
#### User Interface: 3
#### HTML Style: 3
#### CSS/Sass Style: 3
#### JavaScript Style: 3.5
#### Testing: 3.5
#### Workflow: 4
#### Accessibility: 3
#### Code Sanitation: 4

### Feedback for Me
From Mike (my partner): I really enjoyed working with Sam His Can-do attitude was super helpful when running into  speed bumps during our time working on firebae. He helped me when I was struggling with concepts and he always kept me positive. He was patient when I would get lost in our mess of components and I really appreciated it. One thing that I feel would be beneficial to sam is to take more breaks. for me the long stretches of coding would cause me to have worse focus and not get much progress. sam has really been killing it, and i'm happy to be in class with him.

## D: Professional Skills
While I found some of the sessions this mod to be helpful, in general, I thought the Professional Development sessions were way too basic to be helpful to me.  As someone with over 10 years of experience - 5 in more senior management roles - I personally did not think the time was well spent.  While I did try to insert my thoughts/experience into the sessions to help others understand the concepts, I would have appreciated a bit more thought around how these sessions can be helpful/worthwhile for everyone at Turing (since we are all paying money for this time).

### Cold Outreach
##### Email to Meg following December Break:
Hi Meg,

Please let me know if you have any questions or are expecting something different from me at this point.

**Cold Outreach Efforts**
- **Brice Stokes** - Transamerica	- Brice is a friend of a friend and has worked in the digital world for most of this career. I am having a beer to discuss my next steps next week.
- **Andrew Klein** -	Unleaded Group -	Andrew is the co-founder of Unleaded Group and a friend. I have an unscheduled beer with him over the next few weeks to discuss potential roles at Unleaded and to try and make other connections.
- **Matt Kosick**	- Google - Friend of my fiance. I have reached out to him asking for contacts at Google in Boulder where he worked up until recently.

My best,
Sam

*I will be sending more cold outreaches today and tomorrow.*

### Project management
My partners and I used Waffle boards to manage out task lists for all of my team projects.  I think it worked very well and ensured we were tracking all of the tasks we needed to complete before submitting our final projects for review.

I think I also played a role in helping to organize/keep track of the items on our Waffle boards through regular communication and updates to the boards.

### Feedback
I think I am very open to feedback and have spent a lot of time considering the feedback received in Mod1 and over my time in Mod2.  I feel like am am very aware of the places I can grow and am actively seeking opportunities to do so.

## Gear Up
#### MicroAggrerssions

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I really enjoyed this session and it was one I needed following the Presidential Election.  One of the things that is most appealing to me about Turing is the social justice orientation of the program.  While I think there is more that can be done to encourage a social justice orientation within the curriculum, I appreciated this session following our break.  It gave me a bit more time to work out some of my thoughts out loud and to develop a more of an understanding of what I need to do as a privileged, white, male in the age of Drumpf.

#### Mapping Journey

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

I was unable to attend this Gear Up - due to illness - but I did read through the materials and found them interesting. I have done similar activities in the past and found them helpful.

#### Grit

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit is a concept I am very familiar with and have spent a lot of time thinking about during my previous life at Teach For America - Grit is a core competency we look for when interviewing potential Corps Members and I have interviewed at least 100 of them and looked for it. I've also spent a lot of personal time and energy reflecting on Grit and developing it as something core to who I am and how I approach the things that are most important to me.  

The reason why I choose a mission-oriented boot camp and why I will seek employment with a mission-oriented organization/company after Turing is because of my need to be passionate about what my work is moving towards.  I have been a part of a social justice movement for my entire professional life and plan to continue to do so and my understanding and commitment to Grit is a big piece of that.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Cold Outreach
* [Cold Outreach](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)

I have sent my cold outreach emails.  Noted above.

#### Networking
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)

I am an experience networker and found the time helpful for starting to think about my pitch to people I am networking with.

#### Agile

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)

I have worked in Agile Scrum for 5+ years so this session wasn't super helpful.  I'm glad I was able to share some thoughts/reflections on Agile with my mod and plan to organize an Agile Scrum session for next Mod.

#### Johari-Window

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)

This was a great exercise for me and allowed me to get a different form of feedback from the normal project follow-up. It's really helpful to hear how other people perceive you and to consider why that might be.  I have been working through some tough family stuff during my time and Turing and am aware that my outward persona may be a bit more rigid/sharp than it usually is and this was a good reminder of that - I am working on that.


#### Finding Opportunities

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)

This session was a good opportunity to start thinking about my next steps.  I feel like the push to begin thinking about this early was really helpful for me and I feel good about the steps I've taken so far to build my network for my next steps professionally.

# E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Elijah (project partner)
I thought you were a great partner to work with.  I think we did a good job breaking down a lot of challenging problems - as a team and, in some cases, individually - and I’d be excited to dig into another challenge/project with you again. I think you have great optimism and set a good tone in group work and my only real feedback is just to say that and to encourage you to continue to use that strength at the Turing community.


#### Devin (project partner)
I thought you were a great partner on this project and I appreciate all the work you put in.  I felt like this was a really “big” project for us - doing a lot of stuff that was new/crazy - and I thought you were really good at partnering with me to make sure we were breaking stuff down into pieces and getting everything done.

#### Mike (project partner)
I thought you were also a great partner to work with.  This was a tough project and I think I probably introduced some complexity early on that was tough for both of us to work through - I definitely have learned a few things on that front through this project. Despite our challenges, I really appreciated the positive/optimistic tone you gave our work together and hope you’ll continue to grow that strength.  Having worked on a number of teams in my past life, I can tell you that optimism and positivity is an incredibly important skill set to have in team work. Cheers!


## Being a Community Member

#### Staci McWilliams (pairing)
Sam was great to pair with he helped us both in-person and remote when we had a snow day. He is very knowledgeable and eager to help. It was very valuable having him help us with our project game time. You checked to make sure we were understand multiple times. My only critical feedback would be to maybe slow down a bit and break things down even more when pairing( and that could just be with us because I was struggling to wrap my brain around the current concepts).

#### Pamela Lovett (pairing)
Sam is knowledgeable, patient, and flexible. While mentoring, he is great about asking questions to make sure that the people he is helping are actually grasping the material at hand. He is willing to take the time to help guide others to the "answer" without just handing it over - which is no small task!

#### Devin Dixon (pairing)
You've been an awesome person to work with and look to for guidance on problems that were tripping us up. Whenever you'd come in to pair, you'd take a moment to fully understand the problem at hand, as well as briefly familiarize yourself with the code being worked on. Then you'd guide us through what you would do to troubleshoot or what may be going wrong, instead of just giving us the answer straight out. I enjoyed pairing with you out of everyone I met with and found you the most helpful. Keep killing it, dude.

## Playing a Part

I think I have played a very active part in the Turing Community this mod.  I have been one of the more active members in the Pahlka Posse and am excited to dig in further to the public ed data api project next Mod.  I also think I have been a valuable addition to Gear Ups and other community-oriented conversations on campus.  I look forward to doing more over the next two mods as we move into a more inviting/productive shared-community space.  I have also done my best to pair with Mod1 students as much as possible and think I've been very effective as a pairing partner with them.
