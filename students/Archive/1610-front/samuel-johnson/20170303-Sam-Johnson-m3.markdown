# Sam Johnson- M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mode was all about working on fundamentals and building a portfolio I could start utilizing in my job search.  With that in mind, I tried to get into a better habit around doing CodeWars (my score/ranking has increased significantly as a result), rebuilding my personal site in React and deploying it ([sam.johnson.io](www.sam-johnson.io)), and putting together a really strong application for my personal project.   

In addition, I also took over a co-leader role w/ Pahlka to help jumpstart my networking (I'd love to be in Civic Tech after this) and started attending IronFE meetings a few times a week.

Overall I think this was a good mod for me - I feel much better about the fundamentals and have a strong portfolio to start pushing out to people.

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Taylor

#### Comments:
PASS

## B: Individual Work & Projects

As noted above, I was excited to have the opportunity to dig into more complicated projects this mod and with more experience hitting APIs and with Redux, I feel like I can actually start building cool stuff that could actually be used by people.  I think my two individual projects were very strong and represent the type of developer I am becoming.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

This was a good warm-up for the mod for me.  I think the final product was well designed and built and I was excited about the feedback I got around my solid testing coverage was great.

#### Evaluator: Brittany

### Comments
Solid effort put into design without sacrificing any feature functionality, app was fully functional (also noticed an attempt at implementing gif sounds extension), and testing coverage was above average. Minor opportunities for code refactoring/JavaScript style but overall demonstrated a solid understanding of React and best practices.

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer demonstrated solid understanding of React, with some minimal opportunities for refactoring.

### Design

4 - Developer aligned design completely with provided comps. Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

## School Finder

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

I am really excited about this project.  I think it solves a real problem by doing exactly what frontend developers should be doing - presenting data in a new and more effective way that makes people's lives better.  I care a lot about education equality and I believe this could help some parents find great schools for their kids that they might not otherwise have considered.

While there is still a lot of work I want to do on this - with regard to refactoring, styling, and additional functionality - I think this was a very solid web application to pull together in just over a week.  It involved new libraries I had never used and also allowed me to come back to Redux and get more solid on that framework.

#### Evaluator: Brenna

# C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

I enjoyed project work this mod and was especially excited to work with Mike on the remEmber project.  While I wish it had been a more substantial project, it was still really nice to work with him as I think we approach problems similarly and he was able to really effectively show me how he would do things different.  

I also enjoyed the Redux project - especially the opportunity to learn Redux - and think, despite a little tension within the team, we ended up with a pretty solid application.

### Weather Redux

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/redux-weather-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

See above.  This was a good project and I am proud of the final product.  

#### Evaluator: Taylor

#### Comments
N/A

### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Feedback for Me
**From Bekah (my partner):** I worked on the redux weather app with Sam. Sam was an awesome partner to have on a really intense project. He is a vary hard worker, positive and honest, and won’t stop working until the task is done.

Sam and I paired quite a bit on this project. Sam is great at pairing. He listens, explains his thoughts very clearly, and is positive if things get hard.

The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is to be able to assign work out if you have too much on your plate.

I am glad we got to work together this mod, you are a very strong developer!

**From Anna (my partner):** My feedback is related to the Redux project we worked together on.

I recognize that I started things off badly by having commitments that took me away from work the first two afternoons of work time, but I always tried to show up after that ready to work and collaborate. I was hoping we would stay late Tuesday night to work on things, but you preferred to go home and do research. I should have done more on my own without reference to you or Bekah, but I have been on many teams, both professionally and in school, where people duplicate work because no one bothers to discuss what needs to be done until the work has been completed and I did not want to step on anyone’s toes. In retrospect, this was the wrong tack to take, and I apologize.

When we all worked together and I did try to participate, you were dismissive of my answers, even when they were the right ones. This made me feel not valued or wanted, even though I wanted to be an active part of it. I had hoped that as the week went on and we divided up more work, I would be able to take a more active role on my own, but you always seemed to volunteer for the larger chunks. I do regret that I did not contribute to much of the codebase, I didn’t stand up for myself more, and as a result you did a majority of the work. I don’t know if you didn’t trust me to do the work or if you simply wanted to make sure you understood the process on your own, but it seemed to me that you wanted that control.

I think my largest piece of feedback is to actually listen to all members of the group and encourage participation, even if you think they have nothing to contribute. They might surprise you.

See above.  This was a good opportunity to dig into a new technology and figure it out and it was nice working with Mike.  I hope we are able to work on something else in Mod4 where we can get a bit more in the weeds on building something.

### Pass/Fail: **PASS**

#### Feedback to Me
**From Mike (partner):** Working with Sam on the Ember project was great. Tackling foreign concepts with a hard worker and great problem solver was a good experience and made the project fly by almost too easily. Sam made himself available to pair often and was easy to communicate with about code.

One piece of advice is practice patience. I'm guilty of it as well but at times Sam was quick to smash out a potential solution on the keys when it would have probably better served us to stop and talk about the approach before putting "pen to the paper".  

Overall a solid programmer and would gladly work with him again. Hopefully next time on a more exciting project.


## D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was an interesting session and one that reconfirmed my commitment to diversity and inclusion.  I don't know if I have much more to say than that other than the fact that I really appreciate that Turing raises these topics and I am excited to continue being involved in this conversation within the Turing community and externally.    

#### Automation

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Honestly, I have done some reading on automation but am not sure I have come to terms with the immediacy of its implications on me and my community.  I need to spend more time reading and thinking about it and then I am committed to be an advocate for people doing the same/building more conscientiousness about it.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

This is something I believe strongly in.  As a political progressive who believes in a progressive tax system in our current environment, I think the idea of UBI is extremely important to start talking about and to start actually planning for because it is not something that is going to happen overnight when we finally get to the point where automation and other advancements have reduced the workforce.

Right now, we have evil groups of people trying to use unemployment, globalization and other issues associated with the centralization and unequal accumulation of wealth as a political tool to pull large blocks uneducated and disenfranchised voters around the world to their fascist world views.  I think it's important to start being more strategic and open about the idea of a changing world order and I think that needs to start locally and build out from there.

## Professional Development Workshops

##### Draft Personal Story
I am a new front-end developer with 10+ years of strategic operations and team leadership experience in the nonprofit, social-justice space.  At my core, I am a mission-driven, collaborator who loves digging into tough problems and working with a team to develop elegant solutions that help the greater good. I am looking for an opportunity to join a small- to medium-sized, fast-paced, and innovative team full of smart and creative people building awesome things that solve problems.

# E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Mike (project partner)
I really enjoyed working with you on the Ember project, Mike.  It was one of the more difficult projects to figure out - in terms of my learning curve - but I thought we had a good pairing dynamic that got us through it very effectively.  I think we were both frustrated at times but think we had a mutual understanding/respect that kept us ultimately on track and able to kick out a very solid project.

My only constructive feedback is actually similar to yours - just to be aware of ideas/a different direction than the one you are on when driving pair coding. I think we are similar in this way - we learn by exploring - but figured I’d mention it since there were a few times where I didn’t feel like you were totally internalizing the idea/direction I was trying to propose.  

 I would gladly partner up with you again and hope we get that opportunity on a more substantial project in Mod4.  You are a great programmer and teammate.

#### Bekah (project partner)
I really enjoyed working with you on the redux project.  It was a really though project with a new framework but I thought you were a really great partner to pair with and figure it out.  I appreciated your patience and willingness to just sit down and figure stuff out together while being super positive, patient, and hard working.

My only piece of constructive feedback is to be more focal when discussing how the group is going to break up work.  Part of this project was focused on doing individual work - and using git workflow to manage - and, at times, I felt a bit pressured to direct people on what to do when I think it could have been better if people just volunteered and/or spoke up about what they wanted to work on. I think I probably could have been better about bringing that out in people but thought I’d mention it.

I think you are a great partner, Bekah, and would gladly work on another project with you!

#### Anna (project partner)
My feedback is primarily focused on constructive feedback from the redux project we worked on together with Bekah.

I think the main tension/frustration I felt - especially early on in the project - was what I perceived to be a lack of commitment to contributing to the codebase we were building.  I know you had commitments that kept you from pairing with Bekah and I during the first few afternoon/nights of the project but my expectation was that you’d be making up for it by contributing to the codebase at other times.  This was a project that had specific goals around git workflow and divide and conquer and I didn’t get the impression that you were interested in working on the project unless it was paired - something that wasn’t possible for the first few days because of your schedule. As a result, I thought the workload/contributions from the group were pretty unbalanced - especially early on - and I think it created tension.

I think my main piece of feedback, based on the above, is that I think your locus of control can sometimes be a little too externally oriented.  At times, I felt like your assumption was that we all needed to pair to get anything done and that, if we weren’t together, you weren’t going to contribute.  From the perspective of a team member, this was frustrating to feel like I was put in a position where I had to spend more of my time picking up the slack.  For example, I did the majority of the CSS - after Bekah did the initial setup/styling.  I felt like that was a place where you could have done some more of the work when you were having trouble with other parts of the code.

I am happy to discuss any of this with you if you’d like and I am sorry for not sharing it earlier.

#### Noah Berman (Pahlka Co-Leader)
Noah, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to get more involved with Pahlka this mod.  You did a LOT of the heavy lifting - especially with the Spikes you led - and I appreciated that. Im going to do my best to carry on the tradition!

One piece of small constructive feedback that I would give you is that I do think there were times this mod where there was some room to involve me a bit more as a co-lead.  For instance, I offered to help/brainstorm/etc on the first spike around Civic Tech but didn’t hear anything - to be honest, it was a bit awkward to then find out that you and Ali had partnered and were presenting. I suspect this is mostly the result of time constraints/etc with your Mod4 work, but thought I’d mention it as something to consider/reflect on in the future.


## Being a Community Member

#### Noah Berman (Pahlka Co-Leader)
We kind of ambushed Sam with the offer to co-lead Pahlka Posse at the end of last mod, and he has taken on the position with skill and enthusiasm. His work in trying to obtain more resources for Pahlka as well as building our engagement with mods 1 + 2 has been and continues to be incredibly valuable in terms of Pahlka's continued existence. Thanks so much for your willingness to take the helm of the good ship Pahlka Posse, and #pahlkaforever!

#### Nick Chambers (Pahlka dude)
Sam stepped up to the plate to be one of our fearless leaders for the Pahlka Posse. He took on a bunch of responsbility for communicating to the posse at large and getting things organized. Most importantly, he is a cool and intelligent dude who has been fun to spend time with. He has a lot of knowledge and passion for education, and I think he's the right leader to carry the posse into the future.

## Playing a Part

I've played an active role this module as co-lead of the Pahlka Posse and as an active member of IronFE, Gear Up and class discussions.  I think the feedback I've received from Pahlka illustrates this.
