# Sam Johnson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I entered Turing with the goal of becoming a skilled and passionate junior developer.  I have really enjoyed my time at Turing so far and feel like I have gotten into a good groove of learning while also being pushed and challenged by the material. My time here so far has represented a big change for me in terms of the daily routines I've become accustomed to in my 11 years post-college but I am really happy with it. While I have had a number of personal challenges during my time at Turing, I have also enjoyed the opportunities I've had to interact and get to know the community more.  I am looking forward to getting more active as a community member next Mod.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* Solid on completion, got through phase 1 and phase 2
* JS and jQuery style was very good, could use some refactoring to clean up repeated jQuery selections
* Workflow was great - very proficient and quick with Atom/terminal
* Collaboration was great as well, could use more of the "why" you want to write this code and not just "what" the code is that you're writing

## Rubric Scores

### Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow
* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My primary focus this Mod was building a solid foundation around HTML, CSS and JS syntax.  With that in mind, I used my personal site as an opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS.  During my time off from school, I am excited to bring fresh eyes to the project and to take what I've learned over the full 6 weeks to improve the code base and overall design of the site.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were a big part of my experience in Mod1 and I enjoyed the opportunity to pair with people on each project. I think I was a strong partner during Mod1 but also acknowledge that I have room to grow in this respect - especially with respect to being open to more collaborative approaches to completing work.  My background has given me a self-starter/completer skillset that I greatly value and that has gotten me very far but I am aware of the fact that there are real benefits to opening myself up more to collaboration and more robust pairing.

### GameTime

###### Partner: Jeff Buss

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JeffBuss/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This was the final project for Mod1 and it was a big one. For the first time in the module, I really struggled to wrap my head around the project and that really pushed me to reflect and consider new ways to approach work and progress when I don't have any idea what I am doing.  I really took a lot out of that experience and feel a lot more comfortable with the steps and mindsets I need to use to push through challenging experiences.  This project also allowed me an opportunity to get a lot more comfortable with object-oriented design, javascript and canvas manipulation.  I think I worked well with Buss to divide and conquer the huge amount of work we had to get done and to come together to problem solve and pair when necessary.

## Rubric Scores

### Functional Expectations
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing
* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

### JavaScript Style
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow
* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### The output from JSHint showsâ€¦
* 4 - Zero complaints

### Feedback to Me
* Great at problem-solving
* Excellent comprehension of the relationship between everything
* Great communication
* Good math/spacial thinking skills
* Works best solo
* Decent workflow

As someone who prefers to constantly pair code while solving problems and joking around with my partner, I was a bit worried going into this project w/ Sam. He always seemed like a super friendly, intelligent guy, but would definitely win the award for "most time spent w/ headphones on in class". I was pleasantly surprised by how well we worked together though.

Despite his preference often being to zone in on his work w/o discussion, he was always more than willing to take time to chat about what we were working on. Our daily schedules were also completely opposite, but we still stayed in constant communication throughout the project thanks to our newfound github expertise.

Sam definitely has a gift for realizing the relationships between seemingly unrelated functions/variables throughout multiple pages of code. I was often lost in the sea of connections we had created throughout this huge (by our standards) project, but Sam was always able to navigate it while thoroughly explaining how it worked. He definitely understands the bigger picture, and this was a huge help for me. He also has a great mind for mathematical/spatial thinking, and I don't know how I would've handled some of the canvas/collision detection sections w/o him.

Sam's workflow as far as keyboard shortcuts goes is solid. He could definitely benefit from setting up bash aliases, and trying to use the mouse a bit less though. I meant to mention the bash aliases a couple times, but forgot - hit me up if you want a hand with that Sam :slightly_smiling_face:

Would happily work with him again!


### IdeaBox

###### Partner: Dylan Avery

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dylanavery720/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

I really enjoyed this project and the opportunity to work with Dylan.  It was a challenge but I felt like we were able to work through a number of challenges we were having with jQuery through pairing and pairing and built a much stronger understanding of the language as a result.

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* No extensions, but base functionality was all there
* JavaScript needs some refactoring into smaller functions, there were some large if/else statements that were getting difficult to follow
* Could use some more conversation in PRs, but commits were atomic and looked good
* HTML was very clean, but CSS needed some details worked out in order to match the comp, width of buttons and alignment of the input fields was a little off, especially as you expand - could use a max width media query to limit the width of the app

## Rubric Scores

### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style
* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### JavaScript Style
* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow
* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


### LinkedList

###### Partner: Breana Knight

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project was a challenge for me due to the timing of it.  Given the fact that we had less than two days to complete the project, Breana and I didn't have a lot of time to pair and work through the project together - something I know would have allowed her to take more from the project.  I am proud of the final product we produced but the biggest take away I've had from this project is the value of being a good partner and the things I can do to be a better one.

## Notes
* Workflow was lopsided, wanted to see less functionality completed in exchange for more pairing and sharing who is driving
* Merging your own pull requests is bad...
* Mixing vanilla JavaScript and jQuery selectors in the same file - be consistent
* HTML was getting hard to read - don't be afraid to add a little whitespace to break up container elements and make HTML more readable
* Should use IDs for unique elements, especially for JavaScript hooks, and then share class names for the same styling

## Rubric Scores

### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style
* 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style
* 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Feedback to Me
Linked list was a great learning experience and I appreciated having the opportunity to work with someone who worked similarly to mine. The short amount time allotted on the project was a stressful experience and I was pleased to be able to work with someone who was level headed and stay focused through the stress. I appreciated your help and time throughout the process.


### NumberGuesser

###### Partner: Eric Sayler

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sljohnson32/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first project and it was a good one.  Eric was excited to dig into HTML and CSS and I wanted to focus more on JS.  In that respect, I think this project worked well as we both had time to really focus on learning those skills and coming together to breakdown our work and pair/problem solve.  I feel like this project was a good challenge but also provided a good illustration for the projects to come - we were going to be challenged but also be given the tools we needed to work through it and learn in the process.

### Evaluator: Bree

## Rubric Scores

### UX/UI Expectations
* 4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.

### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### Feedback to Me
Awesome! Really good points. I try to be patient, haha. I felt maybe I should have been more upfront with making small changes, especially after you did most of the initial JS, but all in all really appreciate the feedback and will def work on the collaboration skills. I also enjoyed working with you! One thing we could improve on: I felt we were too focused on our own tasks; there could have been a little more balance throughout. Just a little gripe!  Anyway, from my point of view it seemed like you may have been resistant to pairing on JS, not sure if this is accurate or if you were hesitant/nervous because I might be more familiar with JS, but it seemed like you wanted to go off and do it on your own, which is fine, to each their own! Anyway, keep that in mind going forward, Turing really pushes pairing hard and so far Iâ€™ve been trying hard to get better at it myself, but its not a project deal-breaker by any means.


## D: Professional Skills

I enjoyed this aspect of Turing and am looking forward to more focus on it during the later Modules - especially around professional development and next career steps.   

While I also really enjoyed the Gear Up topics, I did not feel I got a lot out of them due to the structure of the sessions and time allowed for discussion. In my experience, good conversations on forced topics usually don't produce great results unless they are well organized and moderated.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

It's hard for me to be fully reflective about this session right now but I will say that I appreciated the topic and the goals stated for this time.  I thought there was way too much to unpack during the time allowed but really enjoyed the opportunity to speak about my beliefs and to hear others.  Not that there was much of any disagreement in my group but I was able to take away a better understanding of the importance of listening to people and asking questions instead of assuming and judging.  This is something that right now, more than ever, I know I need to focus on in my personal and professional life.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I enjoyed this session.  It was not something I had fully wrapped my head around before and I thought it was great.  As a former manager, I wish I had watched that TedTalk before.  I think it speaks a lot to the value of empathy and the need to seek understanding with people and to do what you can to help them utilize their strengths in more productive ways.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I thought this was a great topic to spend time reflecting on and helped me to consider the ways I am resilient and the experiences I've had that make me that way.  I also really enjoyed the framework provided by the readings as a way to further understand what resilience is and how it manifests itself in day to day life.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Personal Website](https://sljohnson32.github.io/)
* [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sljohnson32)
* [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1LF3i2gTJgNSzVvc1ROdGEwMWs/view?usp=sharing)
* [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sljohnson)

I thought this was a good way to start Mod1 as it gave me a lot of things to think about at the very beginning of the program.  It helped me focus early on the end goal and make sure I am taking steps and planning for what I want to happen when I am done with Mod4.


#### Feedback
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

The feedback I provided this module is below.  I enjoyed this session but cannot say I took a lot from it other than a reminder of the need to be more focused and proactive on giving feedback at Turing.  As a former manager at an organization that values effective and regular feedback, I feel well versed in best practices here.

#### Learning to Pair
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [DTR Memo with Dylan for IdeaBox](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcCihubHgE-X27AwoWfWdVrWmz5LNEHq8hH8HEBuBtM/edit?usp=sharing)

I thought this was a good exercise for the cohort to go through and enjoyed the opportunity to have a real-life project to practice on.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Jeff Buss
Hey Buss.  I had a great time working with you on this project.  I really appreciate and value your desire to learn and grow through project work and your openness and flexibility to different working styles.  I think we complimented each other well as partners for this project and got a lot of good work done as a result.

We got a 4 in Testing because of the work you did to get that done and I really appreciate that.  I also thought your work on the UX/UI and brick array logic jumped us forward and resulted in a really good final product.  I think both of our areas of code likely could use some refactoring but I think we were pretty aligned on what those areas was and what weâ€™d do differently next time.  Thanks for your partnership on all of it.

One piece of constructive feedback I will share from my experience working with you is that I think, at times, you could be a bit more communicative about where you are and/or what you are working on.  I felt a bit in the dark about what your plan was and what you were working on this weekend and was a bit frustrated about that. I know we were on different schedules - which I am and was totally fine with - but I think a bit more communication would have helped me understand the places in the code I could be working on without having to be concerned that I might be duplicating work.  I donâ€™t think this was a major issue at all - I think our communications as mostly very strong throughout the project - but figured Iâ€™d mention this as something to reflect on moving forward.  

Cheers! Have a great break dude!
-Sam

##### To Dylan Avery
Hey Dylan, I really enjoyed working with you - I consider you to be one of the better developers in our cohort and it was nice to have the chance to partner.  I was impressed by your positive attitude and desire to dig in and get shit done.  I also think we did a great job of splitting off and getting big chunks of the work done efficiently and effectively and was pumped it all came together so seamlessly.  I felt like we worked well as a team and it was fun to dig into our final technical challenges together and celebrate the win when we figured it out!  I would partner with you again in a second.  

Some constructive feedback I have for you is to make sure you are taking sometime after finishing up some work/coding (or throughout) to check for mistakes and/or ensure things look clean.  I noticed a few instances where your code wasnâ€™t lined up correctly and some places where the CSS could have been a bit more lined up with the comps. Nothing major at all but think a bit more attention to detail could really push you forward as a really solid dude in our cohort.

Cheers!â€¨-Sam

##### To Breana Knight
* Given the time constraint on this project, I appreciated your flexibility and desire to dig into the project as soon a we got it.
* I really respected your push to pair with your mentor on parts of this project.  It gave me more motivation to do the same!
* The constructive criticism I have - and this is a very minor point - is that I think you should be more proactive in reaching out if you are having a problem with a line of code and wanted to pair on it.  I know we didnâ€™t have much time - really only two nights - but figured Iâ€™d just mention it as something to consider moving forward on partner projects!

##### To Eric Sayler
* Thought we did really well as a pair by dividing up work and attacking the project in a way where we could both learn and take the most out of the experience.
* Appreciated you taking the initiative to set up the Waffle.io - I wouldnâ€™t have created it if not.
* I know you were frustrated with my use of Git and appreciate your patience there.  You had more experience using Git and I appreciated your help there.
* Overall, I really enjoyed working with you on our first project.  I thought we did a pretty good job considering it was our first project!
* One piece of constructive feedback - with respect to the coding aspect of the project, I felt like you did jump into my JS code towards the end of the project and didnâ€™t really engage with me on it and the changes you were making. As a result, I had to go back and change a bunch of things back to what I had created and redo the work to ensure I could move forward since I didnâ€™t really understand the changes you had made.  I know you are more experienced with JS and coding languages in general, but Iâ€™d just encourage you to make sure future partners are able to follow along when pairing with you as you work through shared code. I know it isnâ€™t easy to go slow and have to explain stuff - I will likely be there with partners as well in the future - but something to consider towards being a good partner/team member.

### Playing a Part

My focus this module was to get settled into Turing and to focus on build a strong foundation around the material.  That said, I think I was a value to the community through my active participation in class and in other structured time - particularly Gear Up. I look forward to being more active in a Posse - I jumped around this mod - and to getting more active within other activities surrounding Turing.
