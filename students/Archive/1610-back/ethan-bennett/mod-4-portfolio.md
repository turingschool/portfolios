# Ethan Bennett — Module 4 Portfolio

### **Areas of Emphasis**

This was a weird mod. Walking in, I already knew what technology I was going to be working with on the job, so it presented an awkward challenge. I wanted to spend as much time and energy as possible on Solidity/Ethereum, but I didn't want to get left in the dust by the rest of the cohort in the curriculum either. I'm not sure I acheived that balance perfectly, but I probably learned more in this mod than any of the others since the first. In light of that, I would call it a success.

### **Rubric Scores**

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

### **Final Assessment**

#### Satisfactory Progress
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.

#### Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.

#### User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

#### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### **Individual Work**

For my open source contribution, I worked on two projects for the Python/Ethereum ecosystem: [Populus](https://github.com/pipermerriam/populus) (a development framework for Solidity) and [Web3.py](https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py) (a Python implementation of the Web3 library, which communicates with the Ethereum blockchain from Python files).

I verified several bugs locally, but the one I'm closest to solving is [here](https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py/issues/161#issuecomment-294399734). The comment from the owner that mentions it being "done soon" is in reference to my work on the project.

For the documentation requirement, I fixed up the "Getting Started" page, as well as one of the tutorials, for a Google machine learning library called [TFLearn](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn).

As of now, my work for Populus and Web3.py isn't ready to be merged. I communicate with the project owner on an almost daily basis through Slack, though, and these conversations would otherwise have been in a pull request. I definitely plan on continuing to contribute to these projects well past the end of this module.

### **Group Work**

Quantified Self was a very abbreviated project for Nick and I, since we had to miss so much of the first week for our training.

For the Capstone project, Schutte, David, Nick, and I built an app using React, Solidity/Truffle, and Rails that can track a food's origin on the Ethereum blockchain. The first sprint wasn't graded, but here are the second and third:

### **Sprint Two:**

#### Project Management

* 3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime

#### Completion & Pace

* 4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint

#### Implementation Quality

* 3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

#### Application of Techniques

* 4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

#### Documentation

* 3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

#### Accessibility

* 3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.



### **Sprint Three:**

#### Project Management
* 3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime
#### Completion & Pace
* 4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint
#### Implementation Quality
* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
#### Application of Techniques
* 4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.
#### Documentation
* 3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
#### Accessibility
* 3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.

### **Feedback and Community**

For my community involvement, I continued to lead Armstrong (with Nick) and held spikes every week. I'm also giving a thirty minute talk at a blockchain conference the week after next. Here's my feedback:

#### Feedback to me:

**From Schutte:** You killed it as product owner. Whenever we got side tracked on the possibilities of the project, you helped us get back on track in a way that would implement the blockchain in an intelligent and compelling way. I really admire your endurance with problems on unknown or undeveloped frontiers. I know you took upon yourself some late nights to hack on our Solidity issues, and you continued to amaze us all by finding a way out of what seemed like a dead end. For improvement, I would encourage you to find a more tempered perspective in terms of the ease and difficulty of tasks. I felt as though you thought things would either be super easy or impossible, and nothing in between. I think a more moderate perspective would help keep steady momentum. At the same time, I know your perspective came from a great place of understanding how our decisions would affect future outcomes. I really enjoyed finishing off my Turing experience with you. Good luck in your career!

**From David:** Ethan I started learning Solidity because of you.  Thank you.  I loved how your “big picture," visionary mindset contrasted with my coding mindset to produce an end product that I’m proud of.  I appreciate how easy going you are even in the face of adversity (think one minute before we presented our project).  You might want to work on how you decide which rabbit holes are worth jumping into and which ones aren't.  I’m excited to work with you on future solidity projects and to watch solidity grow into the language that we both know it can be.

**From Nick:** Working with you for the first time I wasn’t sure what to expect.  In our
brief interactions before working together, you struck me as a naturally
at-ease communicator who never got ruffled.

Once on the same team, I’m happy to report that you truly are a gifted
communicator.  Of all the folks in our cohort, you might be the best at
putting your own interests aside and placing yourself in the shoes of the
other person in the conversation.  You’re an honest listener, and it makes
you so much easier to work with.  We might not always agree.  We might not
always be on the same page.  But I always knew that I could talk to you in
an open and ego-less way.  Because you always gave me the impression that
you truly were listening, and when you said, “I know what you mean.”  You
actually meant it and weren’t just trying to interject to make your point.

As a Product Owner, you took on a role that requires a lot of extra effort
on an already demanding project.  And you came through every time.
Oftentimes in our conversations, we, as a group, needed to be
reminded/guided back to why we were using the blockchain and what made it
unique.  Without those firm course corrections, it would have been
appallingly easy to cut out the blockchain entirely.  Your experience and
forethought made sure we were using the blockchain as intended.

#### Feedback from me:
**To Schutte:** You were an excellent project manager, really, but your biggest addition to our team was your React expertise. I don’t think I’ve had an experience like this at Turing otherwise: where each part of the project was, more or less, delegated, and we all just trusted that it would work out. That’s even cooler when all the parts are technologically distinct—and so hirable!—and it definitely would not have happened so smoothly if not for your React-ionality. I had a great time!

**To David:** It seems like you’ve developed a pretty deep understanding of Solidity at, like, lightning speed. After working with you three times (literally 30% of Turing), I’ve actually seen you pick up a lot of cool stuff in, like, lightning speed. I think you had the most range in this project, and you're maybe the only one of us that made meaningful contributions to all three pieces. I’m really looking forward to collaborating on more Solidity stuff in the future. The only constructive piece I’d add is to be mindful of communicating clearly when pairing. I had a great time on this project, and it’s nice we got some redemption for BoxDrop.

**To Nick:** Finally, I wasn’t the only person on the team making bad jokes. I had a great time on this project, and I thought our communication as a team was pretty top-notch. You did some excellent work on the API, and you also stayed up to speed with the React and Solidity pieces. Pairing with the whole group is not something I always love, but I really enjoyed it with you guys. I also appreciated your project management experience, which helped steer the group and keep us making large, identical post-it diagrams. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to close out the final mod!
