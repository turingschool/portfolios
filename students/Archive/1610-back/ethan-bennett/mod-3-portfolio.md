# Ethan Bennett - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I greatly exceeded what I expected to accomplish in this module. Starting out, I expected to spend most of my time becoming fluent with consuming APIs, and I hoped, beyond that, to save a little time to research the blockchain and machine learning. I ended up with a comfortable fluency in APIs and documentation plus a lot more: I made my first two contributions to an open source project (documentation fixes for one of Google's machine learning libraries), I made connections in the Ethereum/blockchain world that might very well turn into job offers in the near future, and I was invited to speak at a blockchain conference in May. When the mod started, I was skeptical that I would be able to find a job in one of the niche areas that interested me most, and I'm now at a point where it seems almost inevitable.

## Rubric Scores

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: *
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 4
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Sally said the final grade was technically a fail (I accidentally left the hash from the API call in the view) but, after appealing it, she told me I didn't need to worry about it affecting my portfolio review. So I didn't feel like calling it a "pass" or a "fail" was totally accurate. Maybe a "pail."


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work this module allowed me to get serious about developing for Ethereum, and the progress has been pretty mind-blowing. Through the course of my self-directed project, I feel like I experienced mod 1 again...but in a totally different type of programming. I definitely feel like, somewhere in the course of this project, I became a "real developer."

### Lie Ledger

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ethanbennett/lie-ledger)

The first iteration of this project (i.e. the scope of the two week start) implements a proof-of-concept series of smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. They establish a protocol for crowd-sourced fact checking, complete with cash incentives for contributors and anti-troll safeguards. Being on the blockchain, all contributions will be completely resistent to censorship. Once deployed, this part of the app will act as something like an API, which can communicate through JavaScript to browser extensions or native apps that would notify a reader when they're on a page with registered corrections.

Given the amount of work that could be done on this to really make it work well, I launched it as an open source project. After cleaning it up a little, I'll be registering it as an official Ethereum app and circulating it in the community in order to attract contributors. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I learned just as much from my group projects, but for totally different subjects. It's kind of funny to think that I didn't really know what an API was six weeks ago. I also learned a lot about dealing with difficult team dynamics, but I'll elaborate on that below.

### Rales Engine

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdconrad89/rails_engine)

I thought I was learning how to build an API, but in retrospect, I retained a lot more of the ActiveRecord practice from this assignment than I did the API building process (I did a good job on that section of the final, but I definitely had to study it). We also made a pretty cringe-worthy mistake with SimpleCov, which resulted in a not-fun shock in our evaluation. The scores below reflect our fixed test portion, which was explicitly allowed but never updated on the official score.

**1. Completion**

* **4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.**
* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.
* 2: Project completes most requirements but fails 7 - 5 (10 to 6 for individual project) spec harness tests.
* 1: Project fails more than 7 (10 for individual project) spec harness tests.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* **3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.** (After fix)
* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.
* 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* **3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**
* 2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.
* 1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of MVC.

**3. API Design**

* **4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.**
* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
* 2: Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted.
* 1: Project's API is not fully functional or has significant confusion around request formats.

**4. Queries**

* **4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.**
* 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.
* 2: Project has some gaps in ActiveRecord usage, including numerous business methods that rely on ruby enumerables to find the appropriate data.
* 1: Project struggles to establish a coherent ActiveRecords schema, including missing relationships or dysfunctional queries.

### BoxDrop

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ethanbennett/drop-it-like-its-hot)

This project was sort of a train wreck, but we recovered from it well. It culminated in a 4:00 AM final commit, and we all worked well together despite the difficulties. This project emphasized the real value (which we had sort of discounted) of a project manager, and having lost ours early in the project left us with an unclear roadmap and a terrible workflow. Even still, we all did some really cool stuff, and we turned it into a pretty great project considering the circumstances.

## D. Gear Up

Note: These three Gear Ups were my three favorite out of all that I've attended so far.

#### [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
The polygons were an excellent illustration of how segregation can emerge even from groups who consider themselves welcoming. I think it was a really necessary addition of subtlety to conversations about race at Turing. Being from the "Bible Belt," I've had plenty of experience with people who contribute to the angry underbelly of America--and most of them don't believe they're racist, or even unfairly judgmental. Trying to convince them to change their ways is doomed to fail unless it comes with an understanding like this parable: we get that you don't mean to be an asshole, but sometimes our actions have consequences we didn't intend.

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
I viewed this Gear Up as a great opportunity to talk about UBI, so I was pretty happy with both topics. I think it's important not to get too wrapped up in the idea that machine learning algorithms might eliminate the need for human creativity, as even very complex neural networks are pretty dumb when compared with even an insect's brain. With that said, most jobs in danger of being automated wouldn't require creative ML. I think, as this issue becomes more immediate (and the apologists who find optimism in the idea of "different types of jobs we can't imagine" start to realize those jobs don't exist), UBI will quickly shed its stigma and become a serious issue in American politics.

#### [Universal Base Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
I have pretty strong feelings about this topic. Every argument against it is based on the antiquated, unsupported, and self-defeating idea that separating a person's ability to access food and shelter from their clocked hours at work would somehow result in "laziness." Which is ironic, because that's a lazy argument. (1) A poverty-stricken mother with two full time fast food jobs taking the chance to quit one of those jobs is absolutely not laziness. (2) There isn't even an attempt to explain why laziness is bad. We all have times in our lives when we're less productive, and these eras typically precede great periods of development. This is supported by substantial psychological research. (3) Does the person arguing this really believe his or her only value is defined in the context of tasks assigned by a manager? Didn't we all decide to go to Turing because we felt that wasn't the case?


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Jason: Before Rales Engine, I hadn’t had the opportunity to interact much with Jason. It turned out to be a great experience, and it felt to me like we had an ideal rapport throughout the course of the project. Jason was great at communicating what he was working on, and I had complete trust in all the code he worked on. We had a pretty great moment the night before it was due when everything came together, and it happened so quickly that it shocked both of us. I think that kind of surprising progress is only possible on a team that’s functioning really well, and I’m grateful to have had the chance to build that with Jason.

David: I was lucky enough to get placed on a team with David twice, and I enjoyed working with him just as much the second time around. David’s great at diving into unfamiliar technology, and that was especially clear in his work on JQuery, Twilio, and AWS in this project. We had our latest night at Turing working on this project, and I think David’s initiative to keep plowing through it with a good attitude helped the group as a whole. We all suffered from a lack of organization in this project, and it was connected to a weak Git workflow. It’s a constructive piece of feedback to consider, but definitely not something that David was responsible for any more than the rest of us. I’d collaborate with David again any day!

Laszlo: This was my first opportunity to work with Laszlo. His intelligence and his calm demeanor are both extremely valuable assets to have on a team, and they translated to strong leadership in our AWS struggles. Laszlo was also the first of us to realize the gravity of our workflow issues, and I wonder if we would have had nearly the same amount of completed work if not for him emerging as a leader in the group. We all share the blame for our weak workflow and lack of organization, but that’s the only obvious criticism I see. In fact, Laszlo was advocating for a merge before anyone else. As a whole, I think the project was a great learning experience, and I really enjoyed sharing it with Laszlo.

### Being a Community Member
From Laszlo: I was fortunate to work with Ethan on our Cloney Island project: first time working together. Ethan has a very calm manner and has the capability to easily integrate into any team.
He is ready to share his opinion backed by facts, so one should always listen when he suggests a solution as there are a well thought through reasoning behind that goes along with already experimenting with the solution himself.
Coming prepared with his own suggestion, yet Ethan is always open to listen to other suggestions, evaluate other suggestions, adjust if needed based on the team decision and fully support the team decision going forward.

From Jason: I had the pleasure of working with Ethan on Rales Engine. This was the first time I got to work with Ethan and I was quite impressed with his work ethic. We stayed in Constant Communication throughout this project which was great given how much there was to do and how little of time there was to do it. Constructive Feedback: The only thing I would say (and this is for both of us) we needed to have a little more attention to detail (we had a testing issue due to setting up SimpleCov incorrectly so our testing numbers were drastically skewed).

From David: Ethan, box-drop was a hard project for all parties involved.  Thanks for sticking it out!  I really appreciated your positive way of looking at things, at times I can be pretty negative and your willingness to chug along (especially on that last night) inspired me.  One of your skills that I appreciate the most is you ability to offer insightful views into situations and paint them in a realistic light that forces me to think (this really came out during our google hangouts).  I think one of the most important things that you (and I)  gained out of this project was an appreciation for projects managers.  In terms of constructive feedback, I can’t think of anything in particular that you could do better but I definitely think that we could’ve done a better job  as a team realizing (in our case a lack of leadership) a problem and confronting it head on sooner.

### Playing a Part

I led the Armstrong posse with Nick, and I think it was definitely a success. Our last Spike, on blockchains, was probably the best-attended Armstrong spike yet in my time at Turing.
