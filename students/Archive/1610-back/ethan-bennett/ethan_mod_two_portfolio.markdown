# Ethan Bennett - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Somewhere early in this module, something clicked for me. I struggled quite a bit in mod 1, especially in the first few weeks, but at some point (maybe during Bike Share?), I hit my stride. I feel more confident in my ability to solve difficult problems, and I can also see quantifiably that I've become more efficient at solving them, too. Professionally, I also crossed a line in this mod: thinking about my first programming job used to be a lofty dream at some indefinable point in the future, and now it's something I think about in realistic terms and actively pursue.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Conceptual Understanding

* 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

### 2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3.5: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

### 3. Feature Completeness

* 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

### 4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

* 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

### 5. Rails Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

### 6. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps
  
### 7. Collaboration

* 3.5: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual & Group Work

# Group Projects

## Bike Share (https://github.com/mollybrown/bike-share)

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

### 5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Grit

Like many others in our cohort (as well as the speaker in the TED talk), I didn't love the interpretation of grit as a totally quantifiable skill. There were a few really great aspects of this Gear Up, though: first, the reading material acknowledged that thinking of grit as a magic pill to accomplish anything isn't totally realistic. This was nice--it often feels like I'm not supposed to disagree with the general topic of the Gear Up, but this one provided space to have a productive debate from both sides. It was also great to have that discussion with our cohort, because everyone seemed to be far more engaged by the discussion than is usually possible with random groups. And even if I don't agree with the perspective as a whole, I think in-depth discussions about elusive topics like these will always have some value.

#### Journey Maps

This discussion wasn't quite as productive. There were several times throughout the Gear Up when my partner and I had to stop our conversation suddenly just to follow the guidelines of the activity, and I think that sort of defeats the purpose. I also struggled to understand what the takeaway was supposed to be, but I think it's interesting to think about in the context of user stories. I don't know if this was supposed to be the point, but the similarity between journey maps and user stories invites you to think about real-world conflicts through the lens of programming skills: to take smaller steps, to think carefully about the logic, and to consider what could possibly go wrong. So ironically, although I didn't enjoy this Gear Up nearly as much, it did call for some interesting reflection.

#### Micro Agressions

Similar to the Grit discussion: I think the terminology can be abused when we're talking about micro agressions (as many people in our group noted, several of the examples seemed like totally unqualified aggression, and others felt a bit trivial) but the conversation is a very good one. It's easy to not consider the unintended connotations hidden in the language you use, and whether you're being unintentionally disrespectful or simply undermining the message you're trying to communicate, it can have terrible consequences. I also don't mean to criticize the topic when I criticize the language--better terminology only evolves when we're critical our own speech.


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Finding Opportunities

This was one of my favorite professional development sessions, and I was able to use what I learned to start getting in touch with companies pretty much right away. I also improved my LinkedIn drastically over the course of this mod, and I think this session helped me get that process started.

#### Collaborative Communication

* 1. We used Waffle and Google Sheets during Bike Share, though not very productively at times. Waffle was a much smoother process in Little Shop, but I think it was determined by how badly we needed it: there was so much to keep track of in Little Shop that it's simply not possible to complete everything successfully without a tool like that.
* 2. One of my only actionable pieces of feedback from Bike Share was that I should try to be more available on Slack while I'm working, and I got feedback in Little Shop praising my availability and responsiveness. There's not much more to say about such a straightforward application of feedback, but I appreciated having plenty of time for talking about these things with our groups.

#### Feedback II

This was an awesome idea for a session (the adjective sheets, I mean). As many people mentioned at the time, however, the adjectives were all just a little too generic and positive to be of great use. With a more curated list, especially if it includes terminology relevant to the work we're doing, I think this could really be productive.

#### Cold Outreach

This one was immediately useful to me, as well. I've always felt like I'm pretty good at interviewing, but the process of getting in touch with the right people, and somehow becoming more than just a resume in a stack on their desk, has been difficult. Now that I've got some experience, I feel like I'm capable of getting my foot in the door somewhere I really want to be.

#### Networking

This was a helpful topic, but I wish we'd spent a little more time developing our pitches and a little less time practicing them. As far as I know, we hadn't been asked to reflect on a pitch before we started circulating--while that probably simulated a networking environment better, it also undermined the significance of the feedback. Now that I've spent some time thinking about talking points, I feel like trying it out with my peers would be a great opportunity.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

**To Mike:** Your optimistic attitude definitely gave me a positive outlook during the long hours, and it seems like that’s true for the group as a whole, too. You’re committed to writing high-quality code, and you're totally undeterred in that commitment by any bugs or rabbit holes. I think both of us dug into our areas of the app to an extent that made it tough to split tasks, so that’s probably something to think about in the future. I don’t think it was really a problem in this context, though.

**To Molly:** You did a great job managing our team. It was impressive that your response to our inactive Waffle board was to make an executive decision and try a different format (the Google doc), and I think the second try “clicked” more with our group. It felt especially helpful towards the end, as we were crossing things off and finishing up. Since you want to be a project manager in the future, it might be worth thinking about how you’d respond to a situation that called for a stronger arbitration of work, refereeing group squabbles, etc, but it’s awesome that none of that was necessary in this project.

**To Caroline:** It was a huge advantage for the rest of us to have you (and your experience with database structuring) on our team for our first project like this. Despite that, I never got the impression that you were leaving us behind—you handled being the DB expert well. Occasionally there were some mix-ups with terminology, so that’s something to think about in your next group project (but it was definitely never a big deal).

**To Brett:** You’re really well suited to manage a team. You never have a problem being straightforward, and you have an obviously solid grasp on workflow tools, Git, and the “big picture” stuff in general. It felt to me like you always had the most comprehensive awareness of how all the features needed to interact, and that’s no small task in a project this large. I hope we get to work together again!

**To David:** It seems like solving the logic problems behind most of this back-end stuff is really intuitive for you, so I think it’s been a huge advantage having you in our group. I’ve never seen any problem that’s made you visibly frustrated, and that’s a great asset for working on a team. I’m looking forward to working/networking more with you in the second half!

**To Jesse:** I was under the impression we’d always have new teammates, so it was a pretty nice surprise to work with you again. As with last time, I think it’s pretty cool that we can split work as effectively as we do—on whatever schedule we have to be on—and totally trust each other to get the work done. I also happen to be a little too reliant on dad jokes myself, so it’s been fun to have so much dry, sarcastic, and unfunny humor flying around the group all the time.

**To Nick:** We’ve been able to stumble our way through some pretty cool stuff, and personally, I feel like I would have been less successful at scratching the surface of these topics if I’d been trying to do it alone. You’re really ambitious, and it’s definitely contagious. I’m looking forward to all the Armstrong/Python/blockchain stuff becoming a reality next mod!

### Being a Community Member

**From Mike:** Ethan, you were incredibly adaptive throughout the timeline of the project. You contributed significantly to most parts of the projects, and proved to be a great point person for our front end design. On future projects, I recommend you work on following syntax conventions for HTML/CSS so it is more readable to others. Thanks for all your hard work and calm demeanor during Bike Share, and for taking our UX to the next level.  Best of luck on your upcoming projects!

**From Caroline:** I had the pleasure of working with Ethan on the Bike Share project. Ethan is a really great team member and is very easy to get along with. He keeps the team dynamics together. Ethan really stepped up in our project to take the lead on styling with Bootstrap, which was new and uncomfortable territory for us all at the time. Our site looked really nice when it was finished, especially for a first time endeavor. We all agree that was one of the strongest reasons that we got such great scores on the project. I was really impressed with Ethan’s ability to learn a new skill so fast and produce great results right off.

**From Molly:** Ethan, I felt like you were the most versatile member of our team and did an awesome job of offering help on every aspect of our project. I was particular impressed by your ability to jump into the visual design and structure of our website and put together a finished product that showcased our data very well in a short time frame. It was a huge confidence boost for me personally to know that we had a good-looking first project to showcase right from the start of Mod 2. My one suggestion for improvement would be to keep the lines of communication open with team members when working remotely. Again, thanks for all your work and being the swiss army knife of our team!

**From Brett:** Ethan is a wonderful backend developer, however that is outshined by his front end and design skills.  I feel like I have learned more over the course of this project just by asking him questions about styling than the many, many hours of tutorials I have done.  He has a great work ethic and responds to communications quickly.  Ethan, I really appreciated how available you were over the course of the project, you will be an assest to any team with as quickly as you respond to every question related to the project.

**From Jesse:** Working with Ethan again this module was another great experience. His dedication and work processes really helped form our work pace as a team. Ethan took on the majority of styling and helping the rest of us further understand how styling might be handled in such a large project. I really look forward to being paired with Ethan again, and keeping our streak of project collaboration alive.

**From David:** Ethan, I enjoyed working with you this project.  I feel like I can always count on you when I’m having trouble figuring something out and I need a little help.  I admire your determination to practice concepts that you don’t feel as comfortable with (issue 19 was no walk in the park) and your willingness to participate in networking adventures with me at only a moments notice.  I felt like we worked well together on this project in part because you are a very eloquent speaker.  Whenever you explained an issue or offered a solution it was delivered in a manner that was easy to understand and implement.  I’m pumped to code with you in the future!

**From Nick:** Our shared technical interests have led to a lot of time spent together exploring topics out of class. Ethan's always bringing new, interesting knowledge to the table, finding phenomenal resources, and continually exploring. Having someone like him is huge for my motivation to keep exploring topics outside the curriculum and to stay hungry.  Looking forward to leading Armstrong together next mod.

## E: Community Participation

I increased my participation in the Armstrong posse, to the extent that I'll be co-organizing it in the next mod. I also had some great pairing sessions with Mod 1 students, although they regrettably petered out as the mod went on and my schedule got busier. I went to my first couple of networking events and communicated more with my mentor, which, I think, benefits the Turing community by expanding it. But most importantly, I had the opportunity to give 100% to two group projects with teams I thoroughly enjoyed, and I did everything I could to take advantage of the elements of community that are inherent in work like that.
