## A: End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Casey

Student: Brett

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 4: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods independently and can articulately discuss the difference between relationships at the model and database level

5. Rails Style

 * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

6. Testing

 * 3.5: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently
 * 3.5: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 * 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/riverswb/bike-share)

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3.5: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* 3.5: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### [Little Shop: Gryff-Outdoor](http://gryff-outdoor.herokuapp.com/)

If the project was graded, add your evaluation scores and notes. If the project was not graded, add a reflection.

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/riverswb/job-tracker)

* comments: good work with this. i left you some comments and i see your missing a few pieces of functionality, but overall this is solid. let me know if you have questions üëç

### 1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

 * 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

### 2) Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

### 3) Controllers

*    3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

### 4) ActiveRecord

 *   2.5: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.
    2.5: The developer may be calling on other classes in models (e.g. Category.where(title: title)), and may struggle to explain choices they made in implementing some functionality.

### 5) Views

 *    2: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

### 6) User Experience

 *   3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.

### 7) Testing

 *   3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features


## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### [Microaggressions 101: building understanding](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

* As a white male, I know I am fortunate to not experience, or care, about micro aggressions.  Micro aggressionas are a big deal because they build on the person experiencing them. While I do not experience the same things, I try to take in and understand everything that I learned in this gear up.

#### Journey mapping

* Journey mapping is a tool to develop the user experience fully.  We can use journey mapping to figure out how many people might experience a similar thing in different ways.  We can use journey mapping to be more inclusive in our design choices.

#### Grit https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

* Grit is resilience plus passsion? I came out of this feeling like I didn't know what Turing wanted from me.  I do not buy into these pop-sci terms, until there is research supporting the claims I'm not going to put much weight behind the idea, like the initial researcher says.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opertunities

* We discussed ways to find a job other than looking at the traditional sites.  I made a job tracker with companies I might be interested in working at and with a potential contact for each company 

[Brett's Job Tracker](https://trello.com/b/FYMrrLny/job-tracker-brett-rivers)

#### Collaborative Communication

* We read some chapters from "How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age".

* People being open to trying new things, and using tools they are new to, has both been what makes teams successful for me and difficult when a teamember doesn't want to step outside of their comfort zone to use a new tool, even if it is required.

* As a team member, I typically go with the flow and try to help people when they seem to be struggling, as long as the project is moving along at a pace I am comfortable with I am happy to just do as I am told by the project manager.  As a project manager, which I was for Little Shop, I like to layout all of the issues we have before us, we used waffle.io, and allow the team members to pick an issue to work on.  

#### Feedback 2

* We talked about blind spots and right & wrong spotting but we didn't have any deliverables as far as I can tell from this workshop.  

#### Cold Outreach

* I did my first 4 cold outreach emails, but I was excused from the rest because I have confirmed I have a job lined up at my previous employer.

#### Networking

* I met some cool front end people and got to practice my elevator speech.  

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

* David: David is a programming machine, I would be surprised if he got more than 3 hours of sleep a night with as much good code he outputs.  He is also a great team member, always ready with a witty remark to lift the team's spirits. David, I think it would benefit your future teams if you would communicate more with the team about what you are working on, either through slack messages, pushing your branches to github, or updating issue trackers more often.  

* Ethan: Ethan is a wonderful backend developer, however that is outshined by his front end and design skills.  I feel like I have learned more over the course of this project just by asking him questions about styling than the many, many hours of tutorials I have done.  He has a great work ethic and responds to communications quickly.  Ethan, I really appreciated how available you were over the course of the project, you will be an assest to any team with as quickly as you respond to every question related to the project.

* Jesse: Jesse is a natural leader and problem solver that balances what needs to be said with what needs to be done, to motivate the entire team.  I really appreciated that when things came up in your home life that would keep you from communicating with the group you let us know about how long you would be unreachable, hopefully you don't need to go change flat tires too often, but when you do letting the team know you are unreachable is valuable.

* Daniel:  Working with you for bike share was great.  I really enjoyed how you helped me with understanding the database structure.  Remember to speak up! Both, in volume, and when you have an idea!

* Robbie: I was really excited to work with you for bike share because I thought we would work well together, I was not disappointed.  I really appreciate how you helped me with some refactoring and duck typing.  Although it wasn't an issue, remember to talk about your direct methods of communication when DTRing with future groups.  
(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

* Ethan: You‚Äôre really well suited to manage a team. You never have a problem being straightforward, and you have an obviously solid grasp on workflow tools, Git, and the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù stuff in general. It felt to me like you always had the most comprehensive awareness of how all the features needed to interact, and that‚Äôs no small task in a project this large. I hope we get to work together again!

* David: Brett you do a wonderful job of keeping our group on track, particularly by reminding us all to use the waffle.  Your bluntness over the course of this project was refreshing because it allowed me to not waste time or mental power wondering how you were ‚Äúfeeling.‚Äù  I feel lucky to have gotten the chance to know you better and over the course of this project I‚Äôve come to realize that you have a really good heart (that‚Äôs not just fluff, i actually think it). Keep up the good work and I hope to work with you again on another project.

* Jesse: Brett was an outstanding Project Manager and team member in our final project.
  His attention to detail, and thoroughness really kept our project on track. 
  His code review really helped in catching small things that could/would have led 
  to much bigger headaches.

  Brett's attitude and direction really set a productive pace without pushing or 
  demanding anything from the team that Brett wouldn't have done his self. I would 
  really enjoy working with Brett again on a future project. His work style, pace, 
  and effort really were a great thing to have in a group.

* Daniel: I really enjoyed working on Bike Share with Brett. This was the first time working with someone who lives out of town and I was a little nervous . Brett's ability to collaborate remotely and his overall knowledge of Github has helped in improving my workflow. I would've liked to have taken more time as a group to plan out the project before splitting up but that's all I can think of.

* Robbie: I appreciated working with Brett. It was really nice to be in a group where we could discuss matters openly and freely without having to worry about someone taking something the wrong way. I also really appreciated his work ethic and I hope I can work with him again.

## E: Community Participation

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
