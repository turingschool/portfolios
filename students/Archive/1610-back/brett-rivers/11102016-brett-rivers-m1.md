## B: Individual Work & Projects

A summary of my individual projects.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Mastermind is a REPL game, played in the terminal, where the player guesses a sequence of colors, receives feedback on their guess, and makes a new guess, until they get the correct sequence of colors.

###### Evaluation Comments
* Not strong testing

* Look at how to craft methods so that they take arguments and return things to help with your testing.

* Write out what a class does on paper in order to help organize your code into separate classes more easily.

* Completed project, did difficulty

* Many methods were way too long- think about how to separate them


###### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

###### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

###### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application makes use of just a few huge methods to control the bulk of the functionality.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.


###### 5. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/riverswb/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

###### Notes:

* 18 tests, all passes
* there's a rakefile!
* Classes are overall well separated.
* Some small areas to refactor, think about predicate methods, think about what can or should be instantiated.


##### Scores:

###### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

###### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

###### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My group work this module.

#### Night-Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/night-writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The Night-Writer project simulates translating between Braille and English.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* 20 tests, 20 assertions
* All tests pass
* Program worked, did not complete extension
* Would have liked to have seen filenames passed to the file reading and writing
* Reading and write should really belong in the same class/module. Look into class methods for FileIO stuff
* night reader/reader night writer/writer has a lot of redundnacy
* generally good, work on organization and when to use classes, how to organize in classes

###### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

###### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

###### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

###### 4. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

###### Feedback:
Brett was the ideal project partner for Nightwriter.  I became sick right before the project kicked off and progressively became worse.  We touched base over the weekend to briefly discuss our thoughts on the project.  Brett took our ideas and ran with it since I was unable to really help much.  On Monday morning he made sure to catch me up on what he had done and we proceeded to work together to complete the project.  During our DTR I expressed I was not where I wanted to be regarding Ruby syntax and he made sure to let me drive on some of the more challenging parts of the project in order to help me better understand what we were doing.  His team first approach to paired projects along with his willingness to help others makes him a great asset to Turing and our cohort.  - Michael Hill

#### Black Thursday

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills that have been discussed this module

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

* This gear-up was focused on participating meaningfully in your community through being an informed citizen and voting your conscience.  I chose topic 1, to vote or not to vote to read about and discuss with the group.  For me, voting is an important right that I exercise every election by making sure I am informed on the ballot and turning up, or mailing my ballot in, on time.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

* As an introvert, I appreciated this gear-up.  Working on teams made up of introverts and extroverts can be exhausting for me, and frustrating for the extroverts.  Discussing the topics covered in this gear-up in a group made of introverts and extroverts gave me some insights into how work more effectively with extroverts.

#### Resilience / Bill Clinton Rally

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

* I did not attend this gear-up, I had permission to attend a political rally instead.  I attended the Bill Clinton Rally at New Belgium Brewery, which was the first political rally I have ever attended.  I really appreciate the opportunity to attend this rally, it was a very positive group of people and the speakers were talking mostly about the positive things they planned to do, instead of focusing on the negativity of the overall campaign.  The positive campaign speeches were a breath of fresh air in an extremely negative election cycle.  


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)

* Deliverables:
* [Github](https://github.com/riverswb)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riverswb)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/riverswb1)
* I emailed Meg a copy of my resume.

* Takeaways:  Having a professional social media presence is required when looking for a career in the tech industry.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* Jesse Shipley: Jesse has been a great asset to me this module.  From chatting as we walk to the bus, to giving me very good and specific advice when faced with difficult situations.  I can honestly say that the last few weeks of this module might have driven me crazy without Jesse there to help me through.

### Being a Community Member
* Phyllis Hugunien : Brett Rivers has been a vital resource in my Turing education.  We met at a “Try Turing" event and the first week of class he noticed I was struggling and immediately volunteered his services.  We worked through a lot of the homework assignments and drills.  This continued throughout the module, many times I’d be sitting off in a corner, trying to figure out some Ruby code and he would seek me out, plug up my laptop to a screen and immediately start tutoring, using a Socratic method to help me breakdown and digest concepts.  I observed he did this with several members of the Cohort.  When there wasn’t enough class time the sessions continued utilizing Screenhero.  He is insightful, patient, very knowledgeable about Ruby and it’s methods and willing to share and inspire those around him.  He has gone above and beyond as a mentor and I will be eternally grateful.

* Marissa Burton : Brett was extremely helpful. He spent much of his free time pairing with me and is a natural teacher, walking me through how I should approach a problem step-by-step, asking questions so that I would reach my own conclusions. He always made sure I was learning throughout the pairing process so that I could emerge a stronger programmer. He's also a great person to talk to concerning expectations and calming my nerves.

* Edilene Cruz: From day one you made yourself available to help all of us learn programming and understand the "Turing way". Also, during the first individual project you noticed right away that I needed some extra help and without being asked, you offered your help and stayed at school when you actually needed to go home. Please continue influencing all us with your good attitute.

* Amara Lovato : Brett has been a great support to our cohort. From day one he offered his help for anybody who had questions or was struggling understanding any concept. He is also always available on Slack when you are stuck trying to figure out what’s wrong in your code. Especially in the first weeks, that you feel more lost, he made a positive difference in many of us.
Although I think that he is very knowledgeable, he is always behaves very humble and provides you solutions in a very basic way without using the wording that could intimidate you even he probably knows a ton of advance terms.
I’m really glad that he was in our cohort, he has been a wonderful resource and a cool team mate.

* Amy Kintner: Brett has consistently been THE single most helpful, knowledgeable, dedicated figure of our cohort, and those behaviors began well before we even set foot in a classroom. Brett was active on Slack prior to us starting, and his dedication to lending a hand never ceased since. Personally, I sought his help with GitHub issues in the first two weeks; he was more than eager to help, and he acted as a thorough and patient teacher the whole time.

* Jesse Shipley: Brett was one of the first people to really welcome me to the world of code. He was consistently available to all of us new students and had a great wealth of information that he freely shared and help me personally understand. I would have had a much harder time grasping material during some of the earlier concept lectures without Brett's help. I really appreciate the way he made his time available, both with help on homework/projects and welcoming me to Turing. I am confident that I am not the only one who appreciates Brett's presence in class.


### Playing a Part

* I make at least 1 pot of coffee a day.

* I do at least 5 dishwasher loads every week, in addition to my regular cleaning.

* I have made myself available to my cohort for pairings, debugging, and general support.

* Starting Friday, I am taking over Blakement plant care.
