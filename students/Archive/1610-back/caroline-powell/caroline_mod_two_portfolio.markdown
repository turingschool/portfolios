# Carloline Powell - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

**What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?**

At the beginning of module 2 we took some time to write down what we wanted to get out of the module personally and professionally and how we wanted to grow as a community member. I wrote this on that day:

* _Technically_: I want to start developing some personal projects. Before we weren't ready, but we're about to be.
* _Personally_: In Mod 1 I had to focus on myself just to get through, but in Mod 2 I want to feel more on top of things so that I can give back and help others more.
* _As a Community Member_: Since my first week at Turing I've been saying that I want to do all these things, but in Mod 2 I want to actually do them instead of just talking about it (e.g. start a posse, visit the TechStars Incubator, get an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday).

So how did I do on these things?

* _Technical Goal_: I have started developing some personal projects, but they're not as far along as I would like them to be. I'd like to use the intermission break to make some real progress on this.
* _Personal Goal_: I'd say I did a good job. I paired with people and took time to help others through problems when I knew how to solve them. I also led a Friday spike Git and GitHub tutorial for Mod 1 along with Ben Pepper and created an online [repo](https://github.com/CPowell23/github_tutorial) for students to refer to so that they didn't have to go through the gitastrophies that our class experienced in Mod 1.
* _Community Member Goal_: I think I did an awesome job on my community member goal this mod. Amara Lovato and I created the Hamilton posse that will officially start after the break, but we did already start some activities. The github tutorial was a posse endeavor, we set up a field trip for students to attend the local WeWork coworking space, we're sending a large group on a field trip to the Boulder TechStars incubator in March, and I set up an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday morning. I hope we can keep making this much progress next Mod!

## <a name="self-eval"></a>Self-Evaluated Rubric Scores

Find the rubric near the [end](#rubric) of this document.

* **A: End of Module Assessment** - 4 / Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* **B: Individual & Group Work** - 4 / Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
* **C: Professional Skills** - 4 / Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* **D: Feedback** - 3 / Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* **E: Community Participation** - 4 / Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

* **A: Conceptual Understanding** - 4 / Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree of specificity and accuracy without assistance
* **B: Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking** - 4 / Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
* **C: Feature Completeness** - 4 / Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests
* **D: ActiveRecord Syntax and Style** - 3 / Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database
* **E: Rails Style** - 4 / Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes
* **F: Testing** - 4 / Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently
* **G: Collaboration** - 4 / Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/mollybrown/bike-share)

* **A: Functional Expectations** - 3.5 / Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* **B: ActiveRecord** - 4 / Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* **C: User Experience and Conventions** - 4 / Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.
* **D: Code Organization/Quality** - 4 / Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.
* **E: Testing** - 3 / Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* **F: Working Collaboratively** - 3 / Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### [Little Shop](https://timber-shop.herokuapp.com/)

Scores TBD

### Individual Projects

#### [Mix Master](https://pacific-brushlands-14705.herokuapp.com/)

This project was our first time to push to heroku and have a real live website, which was fun.

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/CPowell23/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was great repitition for using RESTful routes and crudding things out. Although I didn't get as far as I wanted with it, I also got to experiment with styling more so than in previous projects.

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
This Gear Up session definitely changed my attitude and realizations on the topic of personal resilience. I've always been a believer that positive thinking is very important and leads to resilience through adversity. It makes you do little things that set you up to be more likely to succeed. The session really made me think though about what makes a person resilient and how people acquire this attribute. I've never thought about it too much, but the articles we read made a strong argument that acquiring resilience is usually not due to anything that we do ourselves. It's usually due to having strong role models, not necessarily parents even, as a child. This made me realize that having resilience might actually be a gift that was given to us by other people, whereas I think a lot of people, myself included, think of resilience as a self-prophesied trait.

#### [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)
In this session my group discussed potential ways to be more effective and potentially impactful on others after experiencing or witnessing a microagression. One particular example given that I remember is that a good way to respond to witnessing a microagression is to start a conversation with the victim of the microagression. This can both help that person feel less alone and isolated as well as demonstrate a good example for the agressor and those witnessing the incident.

#### [Journey Mapping](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)
This session was fun. We separated into groups and took turns interviewing each other about our personal experiences taking public transit for the first time and applying to become a Turing student. After the interviews we sketched out journey maps of the different stages, calling out specific anecdotes mentioned by the group in each phase of the journey. This was good practice I think that we will use when creating journey maps for users of our web applications.

#### [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
Our group for this session was skeptical of using the word 'grit' for the topic being discussed in the articles and Ted Talk. We thought they should relabel what they are talking about as 'passion'. Grit has an entirely different meaning. Grit is perservering and pushing through a difficult situation even when you don't want to. It's easy to work hard on things that you're passionate about.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### [Agile Project Management](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)
One of my favorite books is The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. The book basically lays out all the reasons why companies and teams and everyone should use the agile approach in pretty much everything. It's important to iterate and get to quick minimal results as fast as you can, so that you can learn and course correct on errors before doing a ton of work and having to scrap it.

#### [Cold Outreach](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)
This session gave us great tips for how to reach out to people we've never met such as bringing up a common interest, requesting a coffee date, suggesting a specific time and place for a meetup rather than leaving it open and in the air.

#### [Feedback II](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)
This was a great session to improve our communication skills. We talked about how to take the personalness and offensiveness out of our feedback rhetoric and turn it into fact-based recaps of things that happened and relatable explanations of how situations made us feel. I feel like we all, especially myself, could us a lot more practice on this. Once it's brought to your attention you realize how flawed our commonly used feedback language really is.

#### [Finding Opportunities](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
I learned a lot about how to use LinkedIn that I was not aware of before, and I've been able to use these newfound skills to widen my network and also to help friends do the same.

#### [Johari Window](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)
I thought the Johari Window was a great exercise. We each anonymously filled out a form about ourselves and each person we've worked with in a group, circling adjectives that we thought described us or the person we were filling the form out for. Then we recieved the forms that people filled out about us and compared the results to what we thought of ourselves. I thought it was good because the anonymous aspect gave people a chance to give real and unvarnished feedback. It helped us learn a lot about how others percieve us versus how we percieve ourselves.

#### [Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)
The networking session was good practice for giving our personal elevator pitches about who we are, how we got where we are, and what's next in a succinct way.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

*-To Molly Brown*

I had the pleasure of working with Molly on the Bike Share project. We chose Molly to be our project manager and she did a great job keeping us organized and on track. In addition to being a great project manager, Molly was a real team asset on analytics methods and bonus extensions. One of Molly’s greatest strengths is that she is not afraid to go above and beyond and tackle new things with little guidance. She took the lead in figuring out the google maps API, and as a result we had a stunning index page that displayed the locations of each bike station in San Francisco. The map was a real wow factor that gave our site immediate visual appeal on a project very early on in our program at Turing.

*-To Mike Schutte*

Mike is known for his positive attitude and ability to write super clean super efficient code. There are almost always 10-20 sets of code that you could write to get the same job done. Mike is notorious for finding the absolute best code solution out of those 20 possibilities. He pays a lot of attention to detail and his appetite for exploration and performance benchmarking will no doubt lead to high-performance sites as he continues his development career. He is also a great communicator and works hard to keep up team morale. The last night of the project we ran into an issue and had to stay up late working to resolve it. We were all fading but Mike kept our team spirit high and that really helped us to push through in the end.

*-To Ethan Bennett*

I had the pleasure of working with Ethan on the Bike Share project. Ethan is a really great team member and is very easy to get along with. He keeps the team dynamics together. Ethan really stepped up in our project to take the lead on styling with Bootstrap, which was new and uncomfortable territory for us all at the time. Our site looked really nice when it was finished, especially for a first time endeavor. We all agree that was one of the strongest reasons that we got such great scores on the project. I was really impressed with Ethan’s ability to learn a new skill so fast and produce great results right off.

*-To Robbie Smith*

Robbie is the king of refactoring. It's like he has a photographic memory of all the code in a project. In our Little Shop project he was constantly noticing and calling out places where we'd written redundant code, and he took it upon himself to refactor and clean up the project. It was a really large project that could have gotten very messy if we didn't have him focusing on good clean code. This was my second project working with Robbie and again I'll say that out of everyone in our class he is one of the strongest when it comes to knowledge of ruby. He is able to constantly implement the cleanest code solutions.

*-To Lucy Conklin*

Lucy is so fun to be around and to work with. On Little Shop, she did a great job being our project manager and facilitating our user story workflow on GitHub. I really appreciated that after every team meeting she would send a recap of the conversation and what each of us should be working on. It was a hard project to split up and she kept us organized and making progress.

Lucy is one of the best when it comes to front end styling and she served as Creative Director for our project so that she could share her knowledge with each of us. We all significantly improved our styling abilities because she took the time to teach us.

I also really appreciated her partnership in implementing stripe payments for the first time in our project. It was new material for us both. She was able to diagnose issues and get us through hurdles and we ended up getting it installed in just a few hours - not bad for a first time.

*-To Nick Erhardt*

This was my first time and a privilege to get to work with Nick. Nick worked with developers before coming to Turing and you can really tell how much knowledge he obtained from that experience. He has an excellent grasp of Ruby and Rails and is a master of TDD. I really appreciated him taking so much time to explain topics to me that I was unfamiliar with. My knowledge greatly increased in this project as a result. It was also a privilege to have an industry guru on the team to answer questions about "the real world" and best practice industry norms for high-quality professional developers.

I also have to say that he has great leadership skills. He helped facilitate several team discussions on important decisions and I thought it was very helpful and effective.

### Being a Community Member

*-From Robbie Smith*

You're a database queen. This is my second project with Caroline, and I am still amazed at how thorough she is in her work. Everytime I have worked with you, you have definitely made my knowledge increase.

*-From Nick Erhardt*

I was excited to get a chance to work with Caroline on Little Shop.  She seemed to have a fundamentally solid knowledge of how databases work and relationships between datasets.  

Working with Caroline was an excellent learning opportunity for several reasons.  She has a fantastic eye for detail and takes an analytical approach to programming.  Perhaps one of her greatest strengths was reviewing code.  She quickly had a grasp of what it was supposed to do and asked piercing (yet somehow still very polite) questions when the code didn't seem to behave like one might expect.  She was fun to pair program with and helped us churn out a metric ton of clean code.  

She was a solid partner for designing databases and instantly understood how the database structure would relate to the Rails models.  It also has to be said that she was the driving force behind including Stripe in our project and spearheaded the effort.

*-From Molly Brown*

Caroline, it was awesome working with you on the Bike Share project and I feet spoiled by having you on our team. You took the lead in working through the nuances of creating our database architecture and brought up issues and potential solutions that would have never occurred to me. You are also impressively tenacious about working through problems and researching solutions and testing them for effectiveness. My only suggestion for improvement would to be remain mindful of your ability to dig deeply into issues and stick to a time limit so that you do not end up dwelling on one particular issue for too long. Still, I was very impressed by your ability to consider and issue from many potential angles. Thanks for all your hard work and I hope I get the chance to work on a project with you again.

*-From Mike Schutte*

Caroline, I really enjoyed working on Bike Share together. Your initiative to design the database with the utmost care really set the tone of success for the rest of the project. I also appreciate our shared love for simple things like alphabetized dropdown menus. For future projects, I think you could work on listening to alternative solutions when the group is stuck on a bug. You have great focus, and that focus sometimes led to tunnel vision during ruts in the project. Thanks again for taking the lead on the database design, and being a critical player on our path to completing a great project. Good luck on your future work!

*-From Ethan Bennett*

It was a huge advantage for the rest of us to have you (and your experience with database structuring) on our team for our first project like this. Despite that, I never got the impression that you were leaving us behind—you handled being the DB expert well. Occasionally there were some mix-ups with terminology, so that’s something to think about in your next group project (but it was definitely never a big deal).
