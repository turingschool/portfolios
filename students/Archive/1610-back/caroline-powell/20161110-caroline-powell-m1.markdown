# Caroline Powell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

On our first day at Turing we wrote down goals that we hoped to accomplish in our first six weeks. I wrote that I wanted to apply learnings to real-world scenarios, participate in a student group (posse), and get plenty of sleep to stay sharp. I'd say I'm definitely doing well on the second and third goals. I've been participating in the Bezos Entreprenuership posse and I plan to start a new posse next module with a fellow student. I've also gotten plenty of sleep every night. As far as the real-world scenarios goal, I think we'll have more opportunities to do that next module so that is definitely something I plan to focus on.

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In my first six weeks at Turing, I worked on two individual projects: Mastermind and HTTP. I learned a lot in both projects. In Mastermind I learned how to implement flow control and relied on interface testing to ensure the game was working properly. In the HTTP project we learned how to build a functioning server on our local computer, but I'd say that this project was my first opportunity to demonstrate the ability to encapsulate methods into intuitive classes and to break methods down into their smallest components.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CPowell23/Mastermind-Game)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

In this project we built a game that users interact with through the command line. The design focuses on flow control. The user starts the game and is prompted to select from the options to play, read instructions, or quit the game. If the user decides to play the game they are prompted to guess a 4-digit secret code. After each guess the user is informed of how many characters they correctly guessed and how many of those characters are in the correct position. Once the user guesses the correct code they receive a game summary telling them the number of guesses and the time it took them to guess the correct code. They are then given the option to play again, read instructions, or quit. This game was really fun!

##### Evaluation Comments
Assessed by: Mike
* Started on Tuesday, great progress for having so little time
* Just the one class, some long methods
* Think about how to have methods take arguments and return values
* No tests but good start on how to write tests
* Game works, no extensions added

##### Evaluation Scores
_Test-Driven Development_ / 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

_REPL Interface and Game Functionality_ / 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

_Breaking Logic into Components_ / 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

_Fundamental Ruby & Style_ / 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

_Enumerables & Collections_ / 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections


#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CPowell23/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1610-b/http/caroline.markdown)

In this project we built an http server on our local computer, read event attendee data from a CSV file, and generated unique, personalized web pages for each attendee based on their personalized data stored in the CSV file.

##### Evaluation Comments
Assessed by: Beth

##### Evaluation Scores
_Overall Functionality_ / 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3.

_Fundamental Ruby & Style_ / 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

_Test-Driven Development_ / 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD.

_Breaking Logic into Components_ / 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities.

----------------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

Learning how to pair is one of the most critical skills for a developer to master. I am confident that when we are finished with the Turing program that we will have mastered pairing workflow and I'd say that we got off to a great start in our two pair projects this module. Coming out of these projects, I'm feeling very confident in how to conduct a DTR (define the relationship) at the beginning of each pair project and I feel like I have a good understanding of git and git workflow.

I would also say that going into our last pair project, one area of improvement for me was Test Driven Development (TDD). But after working through the Black Thursday project with Robbie, I feel very strong in TDD and I'm ready to dive into more advanced testing concepts.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CPowell23/Night_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this project we created a translator that could read an english message from one file and output the message in braille to another file.

##### Evaluation Comments
Assessed by: Ilana
* Able to get english to braille but did not go back the other way
* 3 tests - none passing
* Talked about classes for the fileio and other files
* Talked about a bit of refactoring
* Want to look into a runner file and how that functions with the nightwriter

##### Evaluation Scores
_Test-Driven Development_ / 1: Application does not have significant testing.

_Breaking Logic into Components_ / 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

_Fundamental Ruby & Style_ / 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

_Overall Functionality_ / 1: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille


#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

In this project we created a sales engine that could read raw CSV data files from Etsy and generate answers to several business intelligence queries such as top merchants, top items, and the most popular day of the week for purchases.

##### Evaluation Comments
Assessed by: Ilana
* 191 tests all passing. Spec harness passes through Iteration 4.
* Nice job breaking logic into components, not a lot of refactoring needed.
* Made a lot of modules which was great.

##### Evaluation Scores
_Functional Expectations_ / 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5.

_Test-Driven Development_ / 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

_Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_ / 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

_Fundamental Ruby & Style_ / 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

_Enumerables & Collections_ / 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods.

_Code Sanitation_ / 3: Five or fewer complaints.

----------------------------

## D: Professional Skills
The Turing curriculum is not just about making you a good developer. It's also about challenging your thoughts and making you a better person. The Gear Up sessions and Professional Development seminars are just a couple of the ways that this is emphasized.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

As US citizens, we have a civic duty to stay informed and vote in elections. We are provided so many benefits as citizens and the very minimum we can do is vote. During this gear up session I learned about a few unbiased resources that I can use to stay informed about voting information and candidates running for office, and I actually used some of these to determine who I voted for in this year's election.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

In this Gear Up session we reflected about how our society today is designed to facilitate extroversion and how it can actually stifle the creativity and potential of introverts. This strongly resonated with me. While most people wouldn't guess it because I've learned to operate in an extroverted environment, I definitely consider myself an introvert. I feel like I'm constantly looking for opportunities to escape and work on fun personal projects before bringing them to light. I find that my best work comes when I'm given a chance to work and brainstorm on my own before coming together with others to pick it apart and think of ways to make it better. My best work comes from an iterative cycle of introversion and collaboration.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

In this Gear Up session we talked about the idea that how you perceive an event is what actually matters, not the event itself. Whether you view the event as a growing opportunity or as a traumatizing experience is the determining factor in whether the event makes you more or less resilient as a person. This really reinforced my belief in the power of positive thinking. I think that thinking positively just does something to you that sets you up be more likely to succeed.


### Professional Development
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-powell)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carpowell23)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/CPowell23)

In this workshop we learned how to create an online presence that is relevent in today's tech industry. I am confident that by the time we are finished with Turing that we will have a strong portfolio and brand to share with colleagues and potential employeers.

#### Learning to Pair

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [Example DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11dxpTP7t3ZVVoVB0eYM7-K4wpgvsCIsRnA41dIyFfM8/edit)

Before any pairing, it's important to start with a conversation to make sure you're on the same page in terms of expectations. You can use the time to better understand your partner and his or her strengths and needs. If it's a formal project partnership, it's a good idea to keep track of expectations in writing for the sake of both parties. It can be helpful to have something to refer back to if you forget what you agreed on and this can help to avoid miscommunication and misunderstanding.

#### Strengths Finder: The Challenge of Affirming My Strengths

* [Completed Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WUeXI254cNu9LW0BI4m7k1zGQjIGwlrgLiXGT1GTDw/edit)

Stregths Finder is a paid survey that helps you identify your strengths. My assessment revealed that my strengths are Futuristic, Achiever, Learner, Focus, and Individualization in that order. I identify strongly with the Futuristic and Achiever strengths because thinking of new ideas is what motivates me every day, but I also think it's really important to turn at least some ideas into concrete realities because ideas alone don't change anything.

----------------------------

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*-To Amy Kintner*

Amy has been a great classmate in the first six weeks that we've been at Turing. She is always there and willing to help when people have questions, even when she's in the middle of a project herself. Amy is also a great teacher and public speaker. Before Turing Amy was a professor of Utopian Theory, a topic that I normally would not find especially interesting. Amy changed my mind on that though when she gave her five-minute lightning talk on Utopian Theory. She made it so interesting that I actually wanted to learn more! I can tell that Amy's teaching skills are going to make here a great resource for spreading shared knowledge on the dev teams she'll be a part of in the future.

*-To Amara Lovato*

Amara is so inspiring to be around. She is great at bringing people together and making our time at Turing enjoyable for everyone. She is full of new ideas and will be a great addition to any company culture that she's thrown into because she has the ability to excite and motivate others.

*-To Phyllis Hugunien*

Phyllis is the hardest worker I've ever known. She puts in more hours than anyone in the entire Turing community, which is saying a lot. I had the pleasure of pairing with Phyllis on the Night Writer project and I'm really glad that I got to know her. She is so great to be around, and she is an inspiration to us all.

*-To Robbie Smith*

I am so lucky that I got paired with Robbie on the Black Thursday project. Going into the project it was clear that he was more knowledgeable, but he was patient with me and took the time to teach me. I can literally say that my knowledge doubled through the course of the project because of him.


### Being a Community Member

*-From Amy Kintner*

It has been a delight to get to know and interact with Caroline this module. After the trials and woes we all experienced with GitHub during the first few weeks, I doubt any person dedicated more time to mastering git commands than she did, and she became a go-to person for those experiencing any kind and number of git disasters. In addition to being one of the most knowledgeable members of the group in this regard, Caroline is a thoughtful person with a wry sense of humor. I look forward to spending more time with her in the future.

*-From Amara Lovato*

Caroline, your confidence and will to make a positive change in the world are impressive. I love that you never accept things how they are but find ways to make them awesome. You are creative but in a practical way, you are not a dreamer, you are a doer and I'm sure that you will succeed in your entrepreneurial and transformative ideas. Having you in Turing will make the experience much more powerful in a learning and human perspective. Being so ambitious, hard-working and smart, I can only envision for you a brilliant career.

*-From Phyllis Hugunien*

Caroline Powell is the embodiment of grace under fire.  Paired with a coding newbie who had barely a clue how to work in Ruby and apply its principles to projects she nevertheless sacrificed a passing grade to teach me and try to get me up to speed.  She selflessly put in the work required to get our project completed.  

She embarked upon the role of teacher in earnest, taking time we did not have; making me work through the iterations of our project, explaining step by step what was  happening along with the big picture and where we needed to go next.  Caroline employed the Socratic method like a master.  She did all this without complaint, always courteous to a fault, cheerful and patient. It was an honor to be her pair partner.

*-From Robbie Smith*

I really enjoyed working with Caroline during this project. I don't have any feedback that would be considered "criticism". I think our skills and personalities allowed us to work well with each other. I appreciated Caroline's slower more methodical approach, that really helped to keep us focused on the small steps that needed to be completed first with some of the more complicated methods. Caroline's work ethic and flexibility were much appreciated. It is safe to say that we both learned a lot from the project and each other.

### Playing a Part

#### Google Sheets Assignment Tracker
In the first few weeks of Turing, our class was having a tough time keeping track of assignments, due dates, where to find assignments, etc. because at the time our mod 1 lesson plan page was not up to date. To bridge the gap while the page was being updated, I created a shared Google Docs spreadsheat to help everyone keep track of things. I love organization and spreadsheets.

#### Creating a New Posse
I'm so excited about next mod because Amara Lovato and I will be creating a new posse.  In our first few weeks at Turing a few of us got together and talked about several things that we want to learn that are not formally included in the curriculum. We noticed that some of these topics are briefly covered in other posse sessions, but they usually only scratch the surface and are more informative and introductory rather than hands-on. After a lot of thinking and meeting with Allison, we decided to create a posse that turns these topics into hands-on experiential learning. Here is a first-pass list of ideas we have: visit a local incubator and coworking space to learn what services they offer, set up a talk with an intellectual property lawyer, hands-on tutorials for GitHub, interactive maps, online stores, search engine optimization, data visualization, and web scraping.
