# Carloline Powell - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What goals did you set out to accomplish at the beginning of the mod? How did you do on those goals?**

At the beginning of Mod 4 I wrote down the remaining things that I wanted to learn before leaving Turing. Very soon into Mod 4, however, I realized I needed to focus on what was coming after graduation and I did not have time to learn all the things. I am happy to say, though, that two weeks into Mod 4 I started a part-time job at Cuttlesoft, a local software development services company. So while I have not yet learned many of the things I wanted to, I feel like I have the mentorship I need to learn these things and so much more.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass/Fail/Pending

## B: Projects

#### Quantified Self

[Front End](https://github.com/CPowell23/quantified-self)

[Back End](https://github.com/CPowell23/quantified-self-api)

In the Quantified Self project we built a calorie counting application using Node.js. This was our first project at Turing that focused on Javascript and client-side data management. The first week of this project I worked with [Dan Rodriguez](https://github.com/drod1000), and the second week we worked on it individually.

#### Starting Work at Cuttlesoft
Other students worked on a group Capstone for the last few weeks of school. I did not work on a Capstone, because started a new job and went there in the afternoons. Here is a [blog](https://cpowell23.github.io/blog3.html) I wrote about my first couple weeks in my first developer job.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*-To Dan Rodriguez*

I really enjoyed working with Dan on the Quantified Self project. He is laid back and really easy to get along with, and I think our work styles complemented each other. We worked remotely for most of the project, and Dan was always great about communicating and he was always available to help when I got stuck on something. I appreciated the hard work and long hours he put in on our project.

### Receiving Feedback

*-From Dan Rodriguez*

I really enjoyed working with Caroline on Quantified Self. She had a lot going on that week but always found a way to get everything done on time. Sheâ€™s great at visualizing how the entire project is supposed to fit together and was able to get us organized which made it easy to get tasks done even though we worked remotely for most of the project. I appreciated how she always remained calm even though we had a short deadline on this project.


### Community Participation

**How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?**

* [Mapbox Tutorial for Beginners](https://github.com/CPowell23/mapbox-tutorial)
    * Since the first day in Mod 1 I wanted to learn how to build map applications, because this is something I wished I known how to do in all of my past jobs. Since this is not something taught in the Turing curriculum, it was a little more difficult to pick up and I wouldn't have been able to do it without my mentor, July Tran. It is a very gratifying feeling to be able to produce a tutorial to make it easier for others to learn how to build maps. I hope that after Turing I am able to stay in touch and be a mentor for future students that are interested in building map applications.
