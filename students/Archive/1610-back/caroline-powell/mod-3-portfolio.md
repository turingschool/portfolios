# Carloline Powell - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What goals did you set out to accomplish at the beginning of the mod? How did you do on those goals?**

At the beginning of Mod 3 I wrote down a pretty lengthy list of things I wanted to learn. I have to say that Mod 3 is a lot of work and I did not have enough free time to accomplish everything on the list. I did make some progress though (see below).

| **Goal**                           | **Progress**                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learn to style with SASS and zero Bootstrap| *Complete* - I worked really hard to use SASS only and no Bootstrap for styling in all of my Mod 3 projects. I also spent quite a bit of time mimicking the [Turing Header and Footer](https://cryptic-brook-72612.herokuapp.com/) and making it mobile friendly.                                                          |
| Get familiar with jQuery           | *Complete* - I used jQuery in several projects this mod and I feel like I could use the documentation to do pretty much anything at this point.                                                         |
| Learn how to use Twilio            | *In progress* - We did use twilio in our Pinspiration project, but I do feel like I could use more practice. I plan to use it in my personal project to get more comfortable with it.                   |
| Learn how to build maps            | *In progress* - I am working with my mentor, July Tran, to get good at using Mapbox. I'm also using Mapbox in my personal project.                                                                       |
| Deploy an app on AWS               | *In progress* - I attended all of the after school AWS sessions that Mike has been leading. Over the break I plan to deploy an old app on AWS and follow up with Mike on any questions.                |
| Learn javascript                   | *In progress* - I'm just getting started with javascript and I hope we get lots of instruction and practice in Mod 4.                                                                                  |
| Learn how to build dynamic data dashboards in D3 | *Not started*                                                  |
| Learn Python and Django                          | *Not started*                                                  |
| Learn how to generate downloadable Microsoft Excel, Word, and Power Point documents | *Not started*               |

Pass/Fail/Pending

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### [Storm Drains App for the Barr-Milton Watershed Association](https://storm-drains.herokuapp.com/)
The [Barr-Milton Watershed Association](http://www.barr-milton.org/) is the local non-profit organization that manages community efforts to improve the water quality of Barr Lake and Milton Reservoir. Nearly half of the Colorado state population resides in the Barr-Milton Watershed.

Over the next year, the team at Barr-Milton is planning to organize community volunteers to go out and mark stormwater drains with physical markers as a way to educate the public that any pollutants that enter these drains go directly to our local waterways - the water does not go to the local wastewater treatment plant for treatment. Normally volunteers would just go out and look for drains to mark. They don't know where the drains are, and they don't know which ones have already been marked.

To solve these problems and to make the process of marking stormwater drains more efficient, I am designing an app that maps all of the stormwater drains in the City of Aurora, navigates volunteers to the nearest unmarked drain, and let's them designate the drain as being marked afterwards so that other volunteers know to not waste their time walking to that drain. If the pilot with the City of Aurora goes well, this app could be relevant to any entity in the US that is interested in marking stormwater drains in their cities.

**NOTE**: The Github repository for this project is private, because we do not want the source code exposed to the public.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
In this Gear Up session we talked about how small individual biases can lead to large systemic segregation. I thought the [Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/) game was particularly effective in illustrating the concept. My takeaway from this session was that small individual shortcoming lead to large collective failure and that systemic issues from the past cannot be remedied by neutral responses in the present. Small individual "anti-biases" across the board are necessary to fix systemic bias.

#### [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
I've always been of the school of thought that automation is a good thing because it allows us to stop spending time on certain tasks and instead spend that time on increasingly sophisticated tasks so that our society improves over time. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) we watch in this session made me think a bit differently about this concept though. At some point, and that time may be very far off, but at some point we could run out of work to be done by humans because computers and robots will be able to do everything far better and more efficiently. As a society, even though it may be far off, we have to start educating the public about this so that we are ready to respond when it happens.

Today, our society runs off the idea that you have to work for a living. If you don't work, you don't have money for food, shelter, and everything else we've become accustomed to. If we get to the point that the unemployment rate starts skyrocketing because there literally are not enough jobs to go around due to automation, we have to be ready to change the way our society operates.

#### [Universal Base Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
In this session we talked about the concept of Universal Base Income (UBI) as a potential solution to increased automation if it were to drastically increase the unemployment rate in the future. Personally I support the idea, but I think we’re still really far from that being necessary. I think it’s important to raise awareness of the issue and the ideas, though, so that our society is open to it and ready to respond when the time comes. If we start seeing the unemployment rate increase drastically due to automation, I think we need to be ready or people are going to suffer. I also think our society will be much more open to the idea if we find ourselves in that situation.

I really think we have a long runway ahead of us, though, where there will still be jobs avialable. They will just be different jobs, so we definitely need to make sure that universities are promoting learning in the right fields.

#### [Organize Your Sh!t](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_four/organize_your_shit)
In this session Jeff talked to us about how important it is to start looking for jobs now. We also spent the time updating information on our Github, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow accounts.

#### [Innovative Problem Solving](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)
In this session we discussed some good, repeatable steps to follow when solving a problem and interacting with a client. I think frameworks like this are beneficial because they help you make sure you’re checking all the boxes and not forgetting to do important things. Following frameworks like this can help you create a professional reputation and trust with your clients.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*-To Annie Wolff*

It was a pleasure having Annie as our team lead for the Pinspiration project. In addition to being one of the strongest coders in our class, I think she is the best communicator. She is a great leader because she has the ability to command a room and articulate things in a spot on and unoffending way. She is highly respected by everyone around her, she’s easy to get along with, and she is a force to be reckoned with.

*-To Molly Brown*

The Pinspiration project was my second time working with Molly, and my feedback is similar to the first time we worked together. Molly always chooses to take on the tasks that nobody knows how to do yet. Other people are afraid to take on the new tasks that they’re not sure they can execute, but Molly is not afraid and ends up figuring it out every single time. In this project, Molly stepped up and took on the password reset user story that involved sending a text message with a confirmation pin to the user’s phone. Since we needed to hardroll some of the functionality, most of the documentation available on the subject didn’t pertain to us and wasn’t much help. She was able to figure it out anyway. I think this is a quality that any employer should take notice of. Molly is good at solving problems without answers and instruction, and this is the environment we’ll be operating in on the job. Molly can solve problems that not many people have solved before.

*-To Lucy Conklin*

Lucy is a double threat when it comes to software, because she’s great at both writing tough code and styling. She is really great at troubleshooting bugs, and you can always rely on her to figure out the hard to solve problems. In our Pinspiration project she worked on the internal API and figured out how to generate unique API tokens for each developer that requests one. She also led the way on implementing masonry for user pins. Every project that I’ve worked on with Lucy has been high quality because she pushes the team to be strong in all areas.

### Receiving Feedback

*-From Amy Kintner*

I had the pleasure of working with Caroline on our Cloney Island project, during which we – the ladies – cloned Pinterest. Caroline was our Project Manager, a role she took reluctantly, but then owned to its fullest extent during the project’s two weeks. Not only did Caroline setup all the database migrations for us, but she consistently kept us on track by assigning work to each of us individually, organizing pairings, and keeping a watchful eye on our GitHub activity and pull requests. At Turing, I’ve not yet worked with someone who settled into the role of Project Manager and gave the entire project a more professional feel than might have otherwise been the case.

That said, Caroline was also a delight to work with because she never took any of the work or any of our roles too seriously. We laughed a lot, and we got a lot done. It was by far the most fun I’ve yet had at Turing and was an experience I expect to go unmatched in my time yet to come.

*-From Molly Brown*

Bluntly put, Caroline kicked ass on our Cloney Island project. Not only did she do an amazing job planning out our database (as one would expect from her), but she also played the part of a super competent Project Manager. She (along with her co-PM Annie) did an excellent job breaking down our gigantic project into clear and achievable components that allowed us all to work together very effectively. She also did an excellent job bringing us together for check-ins as well. The combination of Caroline taking a lead on our app architecture and on our project definitely helped me (and I would argue all of us) do our best work.

*-From Lucy Conklin*

Thanks for being project manager, and your work on setting up the database got us off to a great start on the project. You are a natural leader and your endless patience and attention to detail made the team super-productive and the pace of work steady. It’s been really wonderful watching you apply your skills to the individual project. You are calmly independent and you know how to get things done and efficiently navigate obstacles to find solutions.
