# Drew Palazzari - Module 4 Portfolio

## Final Assessment

  Outcome: PASS

## Independent Work

  For my open source contribution, I made an addition to the Faker Gem. I wrote a blog post that covers all aspects of the process [here](https://dpalazzari.github.io/open_source.html).

  I also submitted two documentation patches. One for Gem VCR that fixes a [broken link](https://github.com/vcr/vcr/pull/644) in a markdown file, and a patch to Turing's Census README for [generating a token](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/census/pull/163).

## Group Work

###[Quantified Self pt. 1](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/quantified_self)

  Considering this project was in a new language, was very difficult, was a team project, and included testing in a brand new technology, I think we did pretty damn good.

  To clarify, Amy was in the midst of an intense job search during this project, as shown by the lack of completion and testing. The functionality and code that I did get written by myself is pretty good, and pretty well written. I learned a lot about javascript in this project, and despite the challenge, I had a blast figuring it out. Another day and a half, and the project would have been completed. The grading rubrick can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1610-b/4module/quantified-self-part-one/amy_drew.md).

###[Quantified Self pt. 2](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/quantified-self)

  I worked with David on the part 2 section of this project. We had a sweet Node.js back-end that was pushed to [heroku](https://quantified-self123.herokuapp.com/) and worked well with the front-end application we built. This project was the icing on the cake of JavaScript. It brought AJAX, jQuery, and a database all into one application. Everything we could have hoped for.

  Feedback for part 2 [here](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/qs_node/issues/16).

###[Johari Window](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api)

  My group's mod 4 capstone project. Consisted off three apps. [One](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/census) already built and the other two built from scratch. I spent MOST of the time on the Ruby on Rails back-end API that we needed, which was great for a refresher. Up to this point I hadn't done any Ruby-ing for a couple weeks. Overall, we achieved almost everything the group set out to. The application's front-end was built in React.js, and I think everyone learned a great deal in the end. We all came to the conclusion, however, that perhaps React wasn't the best technology to use for the front-end. We really needed some login functionality, which was the one problem the application had.

  The Johari Window group plans to address these issues by re-creating the front-end application in a more fitting technology so we can present it at demo night.

## Feedback & Community

  I accomplished two community contributions this mod. I facilitated a gear-up last week on the 14th and I paired three times with mod 1 students. Once on battleship, and twice on Headcount.

  Feedback from Annie:

  Drew! You are so. fun. to work with! Even though our job the first week of the cappstone project wasn't that exciting, I had a blast putting it together with you. And even though most of our johari code didn't make it into the final app, it was challenging and rewarding pairing with you on it!

  Feedback to Annie:

  It was a pleasure working with you for the first time. I still remember our Johari PORO; it was (and still is!) amazing. It lives on in my memory, as does the act of constructing it. I also admire your tenacity while working with AuthO. I'm sure it was incredibly frustrating, and part of me is happy you were able to deal with the struggle, because I know you are more than capable. Considering it was a new tech stack, I think you did an excellent job in successfully building the application to the project owner's and group's desires. I would happily work with you again; at Turing, and beyond!
  
  Feedback From Lucy:

I’m so glad we got a chance to work together again, and it really meant a lot to me that you chose to work on the johari window project. Once again, I relied on your dedication, steady pace, and positive attitude. You had a huge impact on our success and you clearly understand the material. Your skills and approach are going to serve you well however you apply them!

  Feedback to Lucy:

Lucy, working with you is always an exercise in success. You are an excellent teammate and coder- even in the face of immense challenges. The Johari Window project was a great idea, and I am thankful you were open to letting me jump in and work on it. You will go far as a professional software developer, and some day, SOME DAY, we might solve AuthO. Thanks again for the great experience.

  Feedback from David:
  
  Drew, you’re not only smart but you have a good heart (great combination).  I had a blast working with you because I felt comfortable enough to make mistakes.  I admire your ability to focus in on what’s important to learn and the persistence you have to actually learn it (no matter how long it takes).  You’ve clearly put in the reps (coding wise at least) and it definitely shows.  I’m excited to have a beer with you five years from now to catch up (possibly sooner).  Keep on keeping on.

  Feedback to David:

David, working with you is a pleasure. You are a smart young guy and I have no doubt you will be successful in life. There is no coding challenge you cannot figure out, and I admire that about you. Remember, one point of improvement I recommend to you is to be more organized in the future. Other than that,you are a great coder and teammate, and I hope to keep in touch with you into the future.
