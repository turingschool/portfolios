# Drew Palazzari - Module 3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I want to improve my solo capabilities as a programmer while still participating as a capale member of a programming team. I also plan to think of some personal app ideas that I would like to build. I am building Nerd Bay, and having a ton of fun doing it. I am proud of what I have built on my own this mod.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Solo projects are always fun! I love making new discoveries and overcoming challenges. It is that much better when you accomplish it on your own.

#### Nerd Bay

* [Github](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/nred_bay)
* [Heroku](https://nerd-bay.herokuapp.com/)

My personal project is called Nerd Bay. I'm basically consuming as many API's on one page as I can. I spoke to Josh about this, and we both felt it was too little. I need to push the envelope. Therefore, I am going to attempt to build a popularity flag algorithm that finds the most popular things on the internet right now. I also have an idea for implementing AJAX into my project. Lastly, I want to enable some form of infinite scrolling.

#### Api Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)
* [Heroku](https://api-curious-github-dp.herokuapp.com/)

I did not spend as much time styling and making it look REALLY pretty, but this project was invaluable for Module 3. I learned how to do Oauth, and consume and API (which I have become quite proficient at since). The application was fully tested.

The biggest challenge was learning how to work with VCR's. After that, it was quite enjoyable!

I talked to Sally about this project. She said I did a good job. It was ungraded, so I don't have any evidence of this, but she did like it when I showed her.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

This is an API rails app that serves information from an e-commerce database. We built an API with several endpoints that render JSON. The business analytics endpoints were the most fun.

My Project partner was Mike Schutte. He was a pleasure to work with. Overall, we feel we did very well (before eval) and we expect mostly 4's on our project.

In our hearts and minds, we got all 4's!

Evaluator: Sally

Students: Mike & Drew

Schutte's Feedback to me:

Mike Schutte [10:40 AM]
Drew: Working with you was both highly productive, and highly enjoyable. I respect and appreciate your commitment to quality code through as much paired programming as possible. You are endlessly witty, and exude a positive attitude at all times even in the face of a massive work load.
For future improvement, I recommend gaining more command of your work flow tools, especially the text editor. Itâ€™s a minor thing, but there were a couple times where you made moves to implement an idea, and a laggy mouse drag or selection caused you to forget what your original goal was.
I am incredibly proud of our project, and I firmly believe it was taken to the next level by your fastidious code reviews and high quality Ruby style. Best of luck on future projects!

My Feedback to Schutte:

Drew Palazzari [10:29 AM]
Feedback for Schutte:

Positives: Schutte is an excellent coder. He is highly intelligent and very professional. Schutte is a pleasure to pair with and does a good job  in paired programming. Schutte bring s a lot to the table when working with him on a project. His testing is phenomenal and very thorough.

Constructive: Sometimes Schutte can get in the programming zone and not be as open minded to practical solutions. I too am guilty of this, but it is something to keep in mind at all times when pair-programming.

#### CloneyIsland- Kickstarter_clone

[Markdown link](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)
[Source code](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/kickstarter_clone)
[Heroku Link](https://kickstarter2.herokuapp.com)

We were given the task of replicating kickstarter.com. I was grouped with Kyle Heppenstall, Daniel Rodrigeuz, Robbie Smith, adn Jason Conrad. This was the first group of 5 project I have been in. Overall, it ent really well. There WERE some minor road bumbps though. For instance, I made myself readily available to communicate at pretty much all times. I felt good about that. Some of my group mates were not as apt at being available. There were a couple of times where the repository had several HUGE pull requests that really needed to be merged.

After merging them, it would add to the projects problems. This was an issue a couple times. Especially when these PR's re-push changes to master that were previously fixed(ex: I fixed the edit and delete buttons for a project early in the week, but somehwere along the line those changes were reverted in a merge conflict and pushed to master agian).

We got a 2.5 on overall user experience. I am not a big fan of some of our pages. However, with a little more time and attention spent, I think the website can rbe really, really good. We jsut need to dot our i's and cross our t's. I accept this score.

Overall, the team felt good about what we accomplished. We got together after the evaluation and talked about things to improve for next time. In the end, we were all pleased.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was a good gear up about diversity. Not just in the workplace, but in the world as a whole. As a white male, the system has been biased towards me since before I was born.

The biggest take-away I got from this gear up was a strategy for dealing with non-diversity. I think diversity would improve if, during all interviews, people literally hid their face and were given something to alter their voice. All language in resumes and applications would be made gender neutral. This is truely the only way I see diversity ever truely becoming diverse. People would be chosen for the quality of their abilities, rather than the color of their skin, or gender. Diversity is a great idea, but being a disciple of diversity is inherently undiverse.

It's a slippery slope; one that humanity as a whole has to address together to become a true aspect of our lives.

#### Automation and The Future

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

I think Automation is a scary idea for a lot of people. It's always an idea a lot of people are probably interested in. Most automated jobs (right now) are generally low skill floor jobs, so it's easy for robots to take over. However, technology improves faster than biology does. Pretty soon, even the most technical of human endeavours could be taken over by automation.

I think I will someday be in danger of  automation taking my livelihood. I'm not worried right this moment, but I know there are some genius's out there creating programs that can learn to program. These people spend more time thinking how they could, rather than if they should. Automation is cheaper and more efficient. Hence why all possible jobs will always be considered from a purely capitalist point of view.

I think it's always good to remember that machines need people to build and maintain them. The more robots we have, the more people we will need ot maintain them. Thats a bright spot on the horizon (until some shmuck invents the self-repairing robot or robot repairing robot).

It is inevitable.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Realities: Robots are likely going to take our jobs.

Constraints:
1) Where does the money for UBI come from? the more we tax the rich/businesses/corporations, the more likely it is that robots/out-of-country labor will be utilized.
2) If everyone suddenly has more money, prices will also increase accross the board. UBI will have to consistently increase to compensate for inflation.

Opportunity: Better, more secure lives for all Americans.

I think Elon Musk sets and says lofty goals/things. He's a successful entrepreneur and is very ambitious. I don't think that means that we should believe everything he says, though.

UBI is (U)nuversal (B)asic (I)ncome. An idea born from the fear of a mostly automated future. Robots are becoming increasingly more advanced, and people will lose their jobs to cheaper robot labor. It is for this reason that UBI is entering policy debate. To be honest, the idea of 'free' money every month is also enticing to pretty much every single working American. Who doesn't want a little more? Robots may take over everyone's jobs someday, but (for now at least) robots will always need people to plan, build, and maintain them. People thought cars and steampowered boats would cause a ruckus. Boy were they wrong. Is it plausible to consider the idea that robotic automation could have the same effect?

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W0ZbOzMKDRs0BsG06EqAWX1MYXHfbPTMMWqTyhrLHKQ/edit)

I liked this session. It asked me to make it very clear whata I disliked from my previous job, things I liked from my previous job, my talents, and the necessity to find a future job based on the 7 pedals of the flower exercise. It is invaluable.

#### Organize your Sh!t

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_four/organize_your_shit)

Jeff basically said to have everything prepared for job hunt season. Don't be the guy without a job 3 months later!

#### Innovative Problem Solving

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

This activity was pretty useful for figuring out what to do with my personal project. I have an idea; I'm not sure if I actually still want to do it or not, but it's very nice to actually have an idea of something I would actually want to do. Thanks, Allison!

#### Job Search Strategies part 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)

Prioritize what I want out of a job, and don't settle for less than I am worth.

#### Interview Fireside w/ Ingrid Alongi

Tech interviews:

Be right on time. Do not come early. Wait outside if you have to. Check out 'Lever'. It's hard to differentiate resumÃ©s -> have a nice fun cover letter. Set yourself up for success in your interviews. Get an early afternoon/late morning time (avoid traffic).

Practice your interviews. Saying practice interview question answers out loud. Practice the kinds of answers you're going to give.

Don't bring computer, bring pen and paper. Be prepared with questions, always. Look for culture mismatches. If they expect you to work 80 hours a week, don't work there. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.

Find the balance between confidence and arrogance while interviewing.

Research what some illegal and off-limit questions are. It is okay to ask who is going to do your interview ahead of time. Try to get a tour before-hand. Carefully ask, "What are the steps of the hiring process?" If they tell you one thing, but it's disorganized and incorrect, that may be a sign of a bad culture fit.

Have a super nice follow-up the next day. Email/thank you card. Ask for a business card. If you get an offer, tell them you are expecting another offer.

As for statistics. How you get customers, how fast you are growing as a company, etc.

Constructive: Sometimes Schutte can get in the programming zone and not be as open minded to practical solutions. I too am guilty of this, but it is something to keep in mind at all times when pair-programming.

My feedback to Kyle:

Drew Palazzari [9:52 AM]
Cloney Island Feedback: as ever, Kyle is one helluva programmer. He bring top notch levels of critical thinking, intelligence, and raw coding talent to every team he's on. Best yet, he's awesome to work/pair with and there is no problem a team can't figure out without him.

Constructive Feedback: Sometimes Kyle can be hard to get a hold of. Communication could be better in larger team environments.

My feedback to Robbie:

Drew Palazzari [10:01 AM]
Feedback: Robbie is an excellent leader and coder. This was his first project as project manager, and he performed admirably. I admire his dedication to the red-green-refactor stratagem and would be happy to work with him again.

My feedback to Jason:

Drew Palazzari [10:05 AM]
Feedback: Jason is an excellent teammate and coder. He was our teams rocket launcher in Cloney Island: We give him a task, fire him at the target, and forget about it because he will take care of the story. I would be happy to work with Jason again.

Constructive feedback: Sometimes Jason's pull requests are way too big and he does too many things on them. It makes reviewing his code supremely difficult. I suggest having more, smaller PR's with single responsibilities.

My feedback to Daniel:

Drew Palazzari [10:07 AM]
Feedback: I thoroughly enjoy working with Daniel. He's a very smart individual with a good attitude, and great ideas. His coding abilities are top notch. I would be happy to work with him again.

Constructive Feedback: Sometimes Daniel can be hard to get a hold of. I would encourage him to be more tenacious is responding to emails/github tags/slack messages so that the team can take care of issues faster.

Kyle's Feedback to me:

Kyle Heppenstall [7:12 PM]
Cloney Island Feedback!: As always, I loved working with Drew on Cloney Island. You are great to pair with and do a awesome job of stating your opinion on the best way to write the code but also staying flexible with the way the work is accomplished. You are also a strong communicator and always available and putting the team first. My only piece of constructive feedback is to always put your best foot forward on a PR. Whether it is a stub or styling, it could be worth it to do it all the way done the first time instead of leaving things to be refactored and fixed up later. Hopefully we get to work together in Mod 4!

Robbie's feedback to me:

Robbie Smith [9:57 AM
This was my first project with Drew and I really enjoyed working with him. I think he brought a good energy to the team and I appreciated his flexibility and willingess to get things done.

Daniel's Feedback to me:

Daniel Rodriguez [10:58 AM]
As expected, working with Drew again was a great experience. Heâ€™s a great person to pair with, a hard worker and a very talented developer who will only continue to get better. I would encourage him to take risks and to take ownership of features to push himself as a developer.

### Playing a Part

I actively pair with my module classmates and I am active in the #pairing channel in Slack. I also actively participate in the Armstrong posse. Outside of Turing, I am aware that I represent Turing. I behave well and have nothing but good things to say about Turing.
