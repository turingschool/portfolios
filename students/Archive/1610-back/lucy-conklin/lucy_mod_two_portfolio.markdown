# Lucy Conklin - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Technically, this module, I was most excited to make something that I could share with people. My goal was to begin to fill out my portfolio to show off my skills.

Professionally I really started to kick my job search into gear, and reach out to contacts and potential contacts. So far my efforts have paid off and I have made connections and narrowed down my job search priorities.

I also continued to get to know my classmates better, and it has been really fun to watch people apply their individual skill sets and interests to our projects.

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 4: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods independently and can articulately discuss the difference between relationships at the model and database level

5. Rails Style

 * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 * 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Little Shop](https://timber-shop.herokuapp.com)

My coding time - 33 hours
(does not include project meetings or pairings)

Evaluation 1/12/2017 9:00 AM

#### [Bike Share](https://timber-shop.herokuapp.com)

1. Functional Expectations

  * 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

2. ActiveRecord

  * 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.
3. User Experience and Conventions

  * 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.
4. Code Organization/Quality

  * 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.
5. Testing

  * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
6. Working Collaboratively

  * 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Individual Projects

#### [Rails Mini Project - Recipe Box](https://peaceful-journey-31266.herokuapp.com/)

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/lucyconklin/recipe-box)

I spent most of winter break on this project and at the end of the week I was a little disappointed by the outcome. So I jotted down a list of new things that I learned on this project:
* HAML - I wrote all of my views in HAML
* Authentication/Authorization - This was the first project where I implemented these on my own.
* PagesController - I made a new controller for specific page views: about and contact.

I also got a chance to integrate some of the skills from my former life as an illustrator/designer:
* Illustration - I created an illustration with Photoshop for the front page.
* Fonts - I embedded fonts from Google.
* Design - A good learning practice for me in the past has been to copy an existing design that I've found and modify it for my content. That is what I did for this project.

#### [Job Tracker](https://lit-sea-77222.herokuapp.com/)

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/lucyconklin/job-tracker)

This project took me about 17 hours, and I was really happy with the way it turned out. Since the final product is on Heroku, I was able to send it to a few of my cold outreach contacts. On this project I learned:
* a lot about styling and implementing SASS
* nested resources and advanced routing
* passing parameters

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions 12/2/2016
* [Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md)

This session really stuck with me. I chose the lived experiences group because I find this topic very abstract and difficult to discuss in non-concrete terms. I really enjoyed hearing about the experiences of the people in my group. The gear up has led to multiple conversations with other people in my cohort that have been very enlightening. I've also brought it up with family members, especially since it keeps popping up in conversations at Turing. I thought this was the best one I've been to so far.

#### Journey Mapping 12/16/2016
* [Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

I was in a group with 3 other people and we took turns interviewing each other about our experience when deciding to come to Turing. We created a journey map showing how the process impacted us. We all agreed that the social mission of Turing was one of the main deciders for us.

#### Grit 1/6/2017
* [Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

In this session we stayed with our cohorts and discussed "grit" as a combination of "passion" and "perserverence". A lot of the discussion centered around how it is different from resilience, and whether or not these kinds of ideas are helpful or measurable. We agreed that passion is an important motivator, and that finding meaning in your work leads to better outcomes personally and professionally.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities 11/30/2016

* [Job Board](https://trello.com/b/GQqQ07Oh/lucy-conklin-job-search)

This session was about LinkedIn and organizing our job searches. We created job boards, and started researching companies, and contacts at those companies. It made the cold outreach much easier to do.

#### Cold Outreach 12/20/2016

* 3 cold outreach emails by 12/30/2016
* 3 more cold outreach emails by 1/13/2017

This session was about sending brief introductory emails to potential contacts, and overcoming the fear of reaching out to strangers professionally. I really liked the advice that the messages should be only a few sentences, and they should include a specific time and date for a meeting. So far it has worked out really well for me and I've been able to connect with people in my target geographic job area.

#### Networking 1/11/2017

* attend 2 networking events over break

In this session we practiced our networking skills and elevator pitches. Although it felt awkward, repetition is the only thing that is going to make this easier. Also, as one student pointed out, networking with other students is valuable. This also reminded me about how I would like to connect more with 1610 front-end.

#### Technical Blog Post
* [Design for Rails](file:///Users/Lucy/website/lucyconklin.com/pages/designify-your-site.html)

This technical blog post was a great exercise in planning ahead when styling my site. I also started using SFTP to upload files to my site, improving security.

#### Lightning Talk
* [Repository](https://github.com/lucyconklin/sass-practice)

I've always wanted to learn SASS and I thought a lightning talk would be a perfect way to jump start the process.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

__To Robbie Smith:__ During Little Shop you were an incredibly versitile and efficient member of our team. You are great at assessing a situation and determining when using a tool is the best solution. I learned a lot from working with you and appreciate your dedication and work ethic. You were a leader in clarifying our code, and  my learning has definitely benefitted from pairing with you over the past two weeks.

__To Nick Erhardt:__ I feel very fortunate to have worked with you twice this mod. We certainly did not shy away from any challenges! I appreciate your work ethic, endless patience, and ability to explain all of the concepts we are discussing. You were a really important part of both teams, and I have definitely learned a lot from you.

__To Amy Kintner:__ I find your fearless aproach to coding and love of learning totally inspiring. During Bike Share I enjoyed discussing problems and strategies with you because you are very open to trying everything and motivated to really master the programs we are working with. I look forward to seeing how you apply your curiosity and I think your problem solving skills will make you very versitile as a developer.

__To Jason Conrad:__ Thanks for taking on the important challenge of project manager during bike share. You were an important part of our team's success, and I'm glad I got to know you better over the course of the project. I definitely appreciated both your attitude and dedication. I also really love your design work. You clearly have an eye for color and design, and I look forward to seeing how you apply your skills!

### Being a Community Member

__From Robbie Smith:__ For the little shop project, I really appreciated Lucy's calm demeanor and work ethic she brought to the group. I also would like to say that I appreciated her taking the time to help me learn some more about html/css.

__From Chelsea Skovgaard and Lacey Knaff:__ In her second module, Lucy has again been a great member of the Verou posse. She is always engaged and active in discussions presented by other students. She also presented a Friday Spike again this module exploring data visualization further. Lucy is always willing to experiment and try new skills even if they are out of her expertise. I look forward to continuing to work with Lucy and seeing her continue to develop as a developer.

__From Jason Conrad:__ I had the pleasure of working together with Lucy on Bike Share. She was always willing to take on something that we didn't really know about. Her willingness to try new things was always a great asset to our group. In those moments where we would be stuck on something she would always be quick to say "How about we try this?" or "Have we done it this way?", it was always amazingly helpful to keep the pace going even if we were stuck on something. She also was always willing to pair with us on the styling of the project which was also great! I would be more than willing to work with her on a project again.

__From Amy Kintner:__ It was amazing to get the chance to work with Lucy on Bike Share. She has limitless energy and a drive to get this accomplished quickly and early that I admire. She’s also a GREAT set of extra eyes to hunt for issues and was always ready to jump in a lend a hand. Additionally, her previous front-end experience was invaluable; by now, most people in class have requested a one-on-one with her for front-end pairing, and she’s been wholly willing to do that with her free time, which is awesome.

## E: Community Participation

On December 23rd, 2016 I led a Verou posse Spike a datavisualization and created [this repository](https://github.com/lucyconklin/d3_map). We made a map of US states with the number of national parks in each state. I created a program to parse a public domain csv to create the raw data.

I paired with some other members of my cohort on html/css styling, especially with Bootstrap styling.

I also paired with a few module 1 students, although not as frequently as I'd originally planned.
