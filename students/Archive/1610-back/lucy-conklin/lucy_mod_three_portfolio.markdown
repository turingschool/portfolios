# Lucy Conklin - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### Personal:
Continue to take advantage of all opportunities, and exercise 2x per week. Go to one networking event per week.

Reflection: I only got the chance to go to one networking event, although I did a much better job on 'taking advantage of opportunities'. I went to the Joan Clarke Society meetings a few times, met with my mentor, had a Skype call with a software dev from Switzerland who worked at CERN, and continued to connect with Turing grads who work remotely.

#### Professional:
Ramp up the job search. This module I would like to apply to 2 jobs per week (formal application, or talk to someone who is involved in hiring). I am also looking forward to pursing my interest in data visualization in my personal project.

Reflection: This goal was very nearly met, and has been greatly helped by Schutte and my weekly job search lunch on Tuesdays. It's amazing how much we can get done in one dedicated hour.

#### Community:
With Verou Posse I would like to collaborate with the front end. It seems like something that the whole community is interested in, and multiple people have approached me about it. We are our own network, and I think we should be more integrated.

Reflection: This could also be much better. I think we should make an API and then have the front end do something with it.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### 1/27/2017 Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

1. I absolutely loved this interactive. As a science communicator I am fascinated by how research could be translated into this kind of high quality learning tool. I am also excited that I am much closer to having the tools to make this.

1. In the conversation I reflected on my obsession with inclusivity, and how I see myself forming closer bonds with the women in class, and inadvertently excluding the men. I remembered the last job interview I had, the interviewers (friends of mine) were required to ask about how I would contribute to the multicultural values of the school I would be working for. They were obviously uncomfortable with the question and it was a little awkward. But what if that really is the best strategy. Build inclusion from the bottom up by hiring employees who will work to make the place more inclusive rather than dictating it from the top down.

#### 2/10/2017 Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

1. The first thing I thought about was grocery stores. I always go through the self checkout even though it is slower and it always beeps at me for bringing my own bag. I think a lot of people feel the same way and would actually prefer to avoid making a person do some daily tasks.

1. Trasportation is going to be radically transformed and soon. There are going to be a lot of people out of work, and we should start plannning for that now.

1. What is going to happen to people during this shift? The Industrial Revolution was not good for horse populations, but maybe they now have less dangerous jobs. Will the same happen to us? Coal mining is a dangerous job, and I don't think it is a particularly good job, imagine if all those workers could be trained for more fulfilling work.

#### 2/24/2017 Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

1. It struck me as really fascinating that the markdown referred to automation as a "large, inevitable transformation". When I read that I took a step back and realized how different my (and our) point of view is from the rest of the community. Many people don't think this will happen, or choose to believe it will not happen.

1. What also stuck with me from this conversation is that we have no idea what will motivate people. If there is a Universal Basic Income will people just sit on their butts all day and watch TV or will it free us up for more intellectual pursuits.

1. I've also been thinking about what Ethan said about how relatively low-productivity periods in our life may actually be necessary for us to figure out what we want. They might just be part of the cycle, and not something to be avoided.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Amara Lovato: You really have a gift for bringing people together, and I can’t wait to see the cool opportunities you create for yourself. You are the life of any room you are in, and never afraid to give your honest and constructive opinion. Keep the energy up next mod. Hopefully you will agree that it is a bit more flexible timewise. I would encourage you to seek some critical feedback on your idea for the Mod3 project. You’ll be able to both focus your wonderful enthusiasm and also pare the project down to something functional, beautiful, and socially responsible.

To Caroline Powell: Thanks for being project manager, and your work on setting up the database got us off to a great start on the project. You are a natural leader and your endless patience and attention to detail made the team super-productive and the pace of work steady. It’s been really wonderful watching you apply your skills to the individual project. You are calmly independent and you know how to get things done and efficiently navigate obstacles to find solutions.

To Amy Kintner: It has been wonderful to work with you again. You combine your drive and experience to everything you do, and it really comes through in your work. Once again I am so inspired by your no-fear attitude, and it definitely contributed to the ambitious scope of our project. Your brunch stories were a highlight of our weekend coding retreat, and helped make that time both productive and restorative.

To Annie Wolff: Thank you for taking on the thankless task of product owner. Your user stories were clear, you posted them efficiently, and you were flexible in their interpretation. I think you really hit the right balance of controlling the execution of the user stories, while also keeping us from getting too bogged down in the non-essential details. Rolling them out in batches may have made the process even more focused. I also continue to appreciate and depend on the positive atmosphere you create in the classroom. You are a leader and a supporter, you are doing a great job on SAB, and you are actively setting the foundation for some really exciting opportunities.


### Being a Community Member

From Caroline Powell: Lucy is a double threat when it comes to software, because she’s great at both writing tough code and styling. She is really great at troubleshooting bugs, and you can always rely on her to figure out the hard to solve problems. In our Pinspiration project she worked on the internal API and figured out how to generate unique API tokens for each developer that requests one. She also led the way on implementing masonry for user pins. Every project that I’ve worked on with Lucy has been high quality because she pushes the team to be strong in all areas.

From Amara Lovato: Lucy, you bring light and cheerfulness to the Turing community. In spite of the stress, big workload or any problems you face you always keep calm and super positive, your attitude is definitely one-of-a-kind. I really appreciate your encouragement and your will to help with whatever I need. Having you around is great because you can switch anybody’s mood for the good and you are very supportive so that makes a positive difference during Turing. Thanks a lot for your optimistic view and your endless energy to cheer me up.

From Dylan Avery: Working with Lucy Conklin has been a wonderful experience. Her personal website has been an inspiration to me since Mod1. I think she was probably the first back-end student I met since she has been so prevalent in the Verou Posse from the start. As a co-lead of the posse, she has been instrumental, as she is great at planning activities, and communicating with a large group of tired students on a late Friday afternoon. I also love her illustrations, they remind me of how much I used to like looking at pictures of animals in their underground homes as a kid, and how the holes were all interconnected. I look forward to working more with Lucy on Verou Posse stuff in Mod 4!

From Mike Schutte: Lucy is an absolute positive influence on our cohort. She brings an air of maturity, respect, and excitement like no one else. She contributes considerably to the overall mood of our cohort, which is generally congenial and supportive. This all comes along with her top notch technical skills. She is a thorough problem solver, and innovative thinker. I am happy for anyone who gets to work with her in the future.

### Playing a Part

I helped lead Verou posse this module, and led a spike called "Owl Clock" where we made a CSS clock and some students made it look like an owl. I also led the first Spike and showed a TED talk on design, then did some icebreaker exercises. I've been popping into the #pairing channel in slack to help out every once in a while, and I was a prework guide for an incoming 1703 student.
