# Lucy Conklin - M4 Portfolio

## Final Assessment

#### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3:** Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

#### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* **3:** Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

_The links controller could be refactored significantly. Also, the create read should live on the link model not on the controller_

#### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **4:** Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

_There are a few places where caching could be used to create dryer code_

#### 4. Testing

* **4:** Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

#### 5. User Interface

* **4:** The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

_on refresh, the links keep switching positions. read: false and true is disappering so it is unclear. filter has a search button which I find confusing_

#### 6. Workflow

* **4:** The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Quanitified Self (week 2)
_Feedback from Nate_

- [GREAT Documentation](https://github.com/lucyconklin/qs-backend/blob/master/public/index.html) for the API! I love an API that I can just hit the root and start using it.
- [candy beans!!](https://github.com/lucyconklin/qs-backend/blob/master/test/server-test.js#L48)
- Your API tests are straight forward, your server.js is organized. You've hit my goals at least.
- [Successful AJAX!](https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/QS_Starter_Kit/blob/7fbf2c8b3673da6a1dd5195332c6d14ac797b70a/lib/foods.js#L79-L89)

Pre-refactor, this is a really great start. I love that you took documentation seriously, in your Readme, and production code.
I also appreciate you taking on d3, and being willing to share what you've learned with the class. As someone with a [history of building overly complicated visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz9kBMzJ9sgMIKNwZHgktp3_S8f7DY7jt), I can't vouch for D3 as the best tool for everything, but it is quite flexible. I hope you get more opportunies to explore visualization.
I think that doing some refactoring will cement the concepts in your mind, and help prove to yourself that you have the ability to break this thing down, and build it back up again. Like one might with a toaster.

## Group Work
### Quantified Self (week 1)
Notes:

- The spec does mention that the diary is at the `/` route. It should be it's own page.
- There's several things missing from the specs, but I don't think it's worth listing them all here. The stuff that has been implemented is well done.
- I know testing didn't go that smoothly, but I expected to see more by this point. I'd be happy to find some time next week to pair with you on testing, as we're going to continue working in this codebase.
- Let's find some time to pair on your JS in general. There's some really promising stuff, but also some misunderstandings. Stuff I missed in your PRs that I looked at.
- Good use of github.
- Tracker is up to date, and technically there was an update to it each day ;)
- I know that Lucy had some heavy personal stuff this week, as well as taking on the demo night, which I hope went well. I graded the project according to the Rubric, but wanted to acknowledge that I think Laszlo and Lucy did a great job this week, and I look forward to all the work they do this module. I don't see this as a failing project at all.

#### Specification Adherence

- **2:** Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable

#### Testing

- **2:** More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type

#### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

#### JS syntax and Style

- **2:** Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.

### Git Workflow

- **4:** Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

### Project Management

- **4:** Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.

### Capstone: Johari Window
#### 1. Project Management

*   4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions

#### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

#### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

#### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

#### 5. Documentation

*   4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor

#### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Team has expertly implemented features to follow accessibility best practices.

## Feedback & Community
### Feedback
#### Received

**From Annie:** Lucy, thank you for taking on the thankless job that is Project Manager for Johari Window. It was a great idea for a project and I loved making something that makes a difference for Turing. I appreciated your patience on Auth0. I really thought that we were going to get it working.

Most of all, though, I admire your drive to finish this crazy app. I was ready to throw in the towel, but that's not your style and I really value that.

**From Laszlo:** QS frontend was my first time to work on a project with Lucy. She is very easy to work with, she is a self-starter and has a passion for nice design. She turned our QS project into a Travis CI inspired design. :slightly_smiling_face:
I liked how efficient our paired programming sessions have been as well as Lucy was a very efficient partner working individually on tasks. Especially considering several other things she had to manage through that same week!

**From Drew:** Lucy, working with you is always an exercise in success.
You are an excellent teammate and coder- even in the face of immense challenges.
The Johari Window project was a great idea, and I am thankful you were open to letting me jump in and work on it.
You will go far as a professional software developer, and some day, SOME DAY, we might solve AuthO.
Thanks again for the great experience!

#### Given

**To Annie:** Annie, I’m so lucky to have worked with you so many times over the past 7 months. One thing that I really admire about you and your working style is how good you are at defending your choices. When you are challenged on a decision you made, or an approach you took, you are able to clearly articulate the choices you made. These situations really show your deep understanding of concepts and how you are able to apply solutions across languages and frameworks. You can defend your positions while being positive, reasonable, and always putting the needs of the project first. When you find the right fit, you are going to have a huge impact for whomever is lucky enough to hire you.

**To Laszlo:** Thanks for being so patient and flexible with me on our project. I’m glad we were able to launch into Javascript together. Your style really helped solidify my understanding and made our code readable and easy to follow. When we did get a chance to pair I thought it was really productive thanks to your focus and analytical approach. I can’t wait to see how you are able to apply your skills, and hear about the opportunities you create for yourself.

**To Drew:** I’m so glad we got a chance to work together again, and it really meant a lot to me that you chose to work on the johari window project. Once again, I relied on your dedication, steady pace, and positive attitude. You had a huge impact on our success and you clearly understand the material. Your skills and approach are going to serve you well however you apply them!

**To Kyle:** I’m so glad we got to work together again, and it meant a lot to me that you chose to work on the johari window project. Your capacity to quickly tackle tickets and get the rest of the group up to speed was key to our success.  Thanks for taking the lead on the React app. By the time I even saw it, there was a super solid foundation and clear pattern. It made it easy to jump in and add components. I can’t wait to see how you are able to apply your skills, and what is next for you!

### Facilitate Gear-up Session: Automation

For the original session on Automation, the biggest opportunity for improvement, from my perspective, was to provide more structure for the discussion so it would not be political. The first run-through quickly devolved into politically charged bantering. To combat this we had the students write their names on the whiteboard in a spectrum of how they feel about automation. From this group we divided them into smaller random groups for discussion, then we created new homogenous groups and had them come up with _both_ pros and cons about automation. The discussions I witnessed and participated in were very illuminating and I think our strategy worked. It was a challenge to stay on time, but it helped to use timers for every activity and plan it out to the minute. As for further improvements, I think a TED talk on automation would be something to consider, or perhaps more short videos. I have found they go over better than readings.
