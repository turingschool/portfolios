# Kyle Heppenstall - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus on personal growth in this module is working with other students on projects. I would like to be a bit more flexible and learning-oriented (as opposed to outcome-oriented) on the team projects. Last module I tended to take the lead on the projects and did not always do the best job making sure my partner and I stayed on the same page throughout the project. This module I want to focus on DTR and more frequent retros to improve as a team member.

Technically I am most excited about learning more about databases this module. I would like to incorporate data analytics / visualization in my projects as much as possible. In addition to the standard module 2 curriculum, I am also hoping to stay fresh on my Ruby and learn some Python. I want to continue to do exercisms in both languages and finish the python CodeAcademy course.

Regarding community, pairing with module 2 students was really helpful or me in module 1 so I would like to be available at least 2 times per week throughout the module to pair with a module 1 student. I would also like to help out at one of the Try Turing days. Lastly, I want to continue to be a part of the Armstrong posse and take a more active role in organizing events/sessions with the posse.

## C: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/kheppenstall/bike-share)
* [DTR Memo](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/2e7f74c2b88794f883a021b6d90aed08)

##### Description

Bike Share was our first team project at Turing. We made a web application with CRUD functionality and data anlytics for stations, trips, and weather conditions.

Our team stayed late and demonstrated commitment and work ethic. We were willing and ready to resolve conflict on the team while keeping the big picture in mind (and while not being defensive).  We taught each other and did a great job putting learning first. Our work flow of two people pairing and one person working individually kept our pace high. Styling was consistent across all pages.

For deltas, we could have used Waffle more often and organized the waffle page better. Our agile approach was not always on point. We should have wrapped up the stations chunk better before moving on to further iterations. The organization of our models directory could have been clearer. We should have focused more on base expectations instead of adding extra features (time cap them). We could have been more detail-oriented when merging pull requests (and creating pull requests that are more discrete and smaller). Communication was too reliant on everyone being here. Styling was minimalist.


##### Evaluation


The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

  * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

  * 3.5: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

  * 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

  * 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

5. Testing

  * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

  * 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### [Little Shop](https://github.com/akintner/scoopful)

##### Description

My Little Shop team made an application named 'Scoopful' that brings the bulk aisle to your doorstep. A user or visitor can view items. Logged in users can purchase items (make ordres) and administators can edit orders and add items. Our team used Waffle to stay organized and had a git workflow that functioned well in person and remotely. I learned the most about using POROs (like the cart) in a rails application and styling with CSS flexboxes.


### Individual Projects

#### [Rails Mini Project](https://github.com/kheppenstall/idea_box)

##### Description

For the rails mini project I worked on the Idea Box project. It was my first effort at authorization and authentication. I learned a good bit about verifying users and adding admin functionality to an application. It was also helpful to practice rails fundamentals like routing and the asset pipeline. I used bootstrap for my styling but tried out some new techniques with images and a carousel.

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/kheppenstall/job-tracker)

##### Description

Job Tracker was my our first effort at building a full rails application with CRUD functionality (without a tutorial). I learned the most about developing a schema on a whiteboard and then implementing that with a SQL database through migrations and ruby models. My biggest takeaways from this project were around how to manage a database and nesting routes in a way that makes sense with the objects in the application.

##### Evaluation

  1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations

      4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

  1. Routes

      4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

  1. Controllers

      4: The developer has moved logic out of the controllers and into the models/POROs where appropriate. The developer uses strong params in a private method. Instance variables being passed to views are appropriately named and limited in number. The developer can speak to each choice made when questioned.

  1. ActiveRecord

      4: ActiveRecord methods are used in models to supply all appropriate functionality. Methods exist on the appropriate model, and developers are not referencing other classes or self in models unnecessarily. Ruby enumerables are not used where ActiveRecord methods could provide the necessary functionality. The developer can explain the ActiveRecord methods they used and the relationships between ActiveRecord models.

  1. Views

      4: Logic has been removed from views and controllers to the full degree possible, the developer ha minimized the number of variables passed to the view, and the developer can articulately explain their strategies for extracting this logic. The developer uses partials to reduce duplication of code in the view layer.

  1. User Experience

      4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

  1. Testing

      3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

------------------

## D: Professional Skills

* [Personal Blog](https://kheppenstall.github.io/)

Professional skills this module focused on working with a larger team on projects. I benefitted from the openness around feedback set by the professional development sessions. At the end of each project I received some helpful feedback and worked to implement that through the module (and reflect on it further with the Johari exercise). Professionally I learned a good bit about how to use LinkedIn and how to network successfully to look for jobs. Going forward I know I need to focus on putting myself out there a little more digitally and attending networking events. I also gave a lightning talk this module on RSA encryption. The practice of writing a blog post and then transforming that into a lightning talk made me more comfortable with both of those processes going forward.

I was part of the Armstrong posse again this module. My main takeaway so far has been to take initiative in getting what you want out of the posse. Armstrong has a lot of different focuses and I've mainly used the time to start learning python. Although Armstrong is technically a machine learning posse, python is the standard language for most machine learning project so we spend some time doing basic exercises in Python. Everyone in the posse seems to have their own little side project that they are interested in and I've made attempting to learn python mine.

### Gear Up

#### [Micro-Aggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

My biggest takeaways from the micro-aggressions gear up were from the readings. The New York Times article provides some examples of microagressions and presents ‘microagression’ as the vocabulary to talk about these everyday incidents. Over time micro aggressions can take their toll on psyche and hinder success. I had never thought about the claim that the tech monoculture, although appealing to some, is “draining the talent pool.” Thinking about micro aggressions on a larger scale and the impact on the industry is an interesting perspective. The month of microagressions article was really interesting for me. Reading all the micro aggressions Chee experienced in a month made it easier for me to start to understand how they can add up and seriously impact someone over time. One way forward my group discussed was more story sharing. Reading testimonials or listening to people tell their experiences is a great way to learn about microagressions and help me be more aware about the impact of what I say.

#### [Grit: Passion and Perseverance](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I enjoyed listening to the TED talk proposing grit as the single most important measure in determining “success.” I was especially interested in how that transcended contexts - from spellings bees, to military training, and public and schools. Angela Duckworth claims that having both passion and perseverance in a task leads to more success. Nonetheless, some scientists believe the hype around grit is outpacing the science. More studies need to be done to test for both passion and perseverance while controlling more for conscientiousness. Interestingly Angela Duckworth found that passion is more challenging to cultivate in students than perseverance.

At Turing, I was most tempted to give up when working on the HTTP project. Although the concepts were not challenging I could not figure out the technical pieces to  make even a small test pass. For me it was a combination of grit and collaboration that helped me navigate that frustration successfully. I kept working (mainly due to a passion for programming) and reached out to other people until we figured out a solution together. When applying grit to a specific situation I think the marathon view is appropriate. Do not work so hard you get burned out or exhausted. Instead be intentional and take the long view. Grit does not always mean working harder in the moment.

Part of enhancing grit is giving work more purpose. Moving forward with Turing I would to have a side project that I am passionate about where I can apply my learning more. That way when I’m struggling with something in class I know there is more than just the class project driving my learning. I would also like to apply for jobs more regularly through an average Turing week. Talking with hiring managers or developers about my work and learning will provide additional meaning to the day-to-day work at Turing.


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Feedback II

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)
* [Project Management Reflection](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/b3389ac282c3bea6360b815d01a1bc6c)

In Feedback II I really enjoyed the Johari model. It was helpful to see what traits my peers selected after working with me. The anonymity of it and the way we broke it down into quadrants helped me figure out what traits I want to work on showing more of going forward.

#### Finding Opportunities

* [Job Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_WJWX8b_IXianFk5j1SLe51R45iT0mDW_rF3ir0BcI/edit?usp=drive_web)

My biggest takeaways here were around the process of finding a job. Meg emphasized that it is better to look for companies you are interested in and reach out to them versus looking for online job postings. We then went on to research companies we are interested in and start a job tracker to stay organized in communicating with them.

#### Collaborative Communication

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
* [Project Management Reflection](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/b3389ac282c3bea6360b815d01a1bc6c)

This sessions focused around project management. It detailed some tools to consider (like Waffle.io) and how we can leverage our strengths to help a team. My biggest takeaway was around building a culture of error within a team. I thought it was really interesting how teams that are not afraid to fail perform better (and probably have more fun).

#### Cold Outreach

In this session we worked on transforming our job tracker into a network of contacts. Meg discussed the idea that applying for jobs is often less effective than reaching out to people at companies we are interested in. From there we discussed best practices for reaching out cold to people over emails. I found it helpful to get some feedback on my email and then at the end of the session we sent our first cold outreach email out.

#### [Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)

In this lesson Meg described networking is a form of outreach intended to build and engage network. It usually means attending an even like a meet up or a hackathon. Meg discussed the difference between outreach preferences for introverts and extroverts. Extroverts may prefer networking while introverts may prefer one-on-one conversations. We also talked about one key part of networking - delivering an elevator pitch about yourself. I thought it was interesting to adopt a strategy when networking and be intentional about who you talk with and how you engage them. We ended the session by practicing our elevator pitch and receiving some feedback. I definitely needed the practice and it gave me some confidence going forward into networking events.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Bike Share team

Drew: On bike share Drew did an excellent job working collaboratively in a way that worked for the team. He was always available for questions, asked for help when he needed help but still worked independently to get tasks finished. He also did a great job reminding the team to understand code and practice typing it out from memory. My constructive feedback was to take more ownership on figuring out the best way to accomplish tasks like writing dashboard methods. He was hesitant to switch to ActiveRecord from Ruby at first even though it was in the spec and made the pages load faster.

Josh: Josh’s communication was a strength for the team on the project. He was on Slack the most, never merged any pull requests without consulting the team, and aired conflict when it came up. He also demonstrated great follow through on tasks he was working on, like the CRUD functionality for weather conditions. My constructive feedback would be to ask more questions early to avoid falling behind on topics like the ActiveRecord methods and pagination. That could mean going home less or spending more time at school or asking to screenhero to talk about code.

#### Little Shop Team

Schutte: Thanks for being so passionate and patient throughout the project. You did a wonderful job pushing the group and keeping our goals focused on learning / process instead of just outcomes. Pushing the team to use bootstrap less resulted in some awesome learning outcomes for me (and hopefully the whole team).  Also when I needed to pair to figure more out about Sass and flex boxes you took the time to go over it with me without making me feel like I was wasting time or not contributing to the team. Your passion for coding definitely comes through when working with you. You are always full of ideas and ready to work on anything needed. Since you’re always overflowing with ideas I’d encourage you to try to lead with questions a bit more often. When working on the the initial schema, some styling decisions, and parts of the AP I felt like your ideas were consistently thrown out first. Although this didn’t create any tension on our team it could be helpful to keep in mind when working with other groups in the future. Thanks for being such a great team member and I hope we get to work together again!

Annie: I really appreciated the opportunity to work with you on this project. You were incredibly reliable and productive on everything you did. I felt like you consistently took on some of the most challenging aspects of the project without complaining or getting stressed out about it. I also felt like you struck a proper balance between putting out your opinions for the team to consider and being flexible / putting the team first. Your ideas around how to setup the initial schema and saving costs for orders were awesome and made the whole project go more smoothly. I also appreciated your mentorship on styling and figuring out sass. My only piece of constructive feedback is to have a bit more attention to details on pull requests. I occasionally felt like I was the only one commenting on specific lines in pull requests and would have appreciated some more line-by-line feedback on my code (constructive and positive). I really enjoyed working with you and hopefully we get to do it again!

Amy: You were a wonderful project manager for our team in Little Shop. Your delegation and diligent use of Waffle kept us all organized. Our git workflow and task management was on point due to your leadership. Also I really respect how you communicated so openly about being sick and kept the team moving in the best way possible when you were sick. That took a lot of humility and I don’t think you could have handled it any better. Next time you’re project manager I would encourage you to be a bit more directive in person. There were times when we were all just standing around a lot waiting for a group discussion to take place, and it would have been helpful for you to just rally us together and get things moving. Thanks for being such a great team member and hopefully we can work together on a third project before our time at Turing is done!

### Being a Community Member

#### Bike Share team

From Josh: NEG: Remember your coworkers are adults, and will need a different teaching style. POS: You’re a rare combination of work ethic and raw intelligence.  It was a pleasure working with you.

From Drew: Don't take on too much work. Kyle did too much work, even after like 8-9 hours of working at school. If there is something Kyle feels NEEDS to be done, even after a day's work,  he should ask  group members for help. Most students at Turing  work hard and are willing to go the extra mile to finish a project. Don't burn yourself out. You-are-awesome Feedback:  I think our collaborative work styles really meshed well together. Had a ton of fun working on this project with Kyle. Kyle is an excellent coder, and there is a ton to learn from him. I would be very pleased to work with Kyle again.

#### Little Shop Team

From Schutte: I'm very grateful for getting to work with you on this final project. You are an incredibly strong programmer, yet the technical mastery never comes across as arrogant or pretentious. You are an incredibly clear communicator, and demonstrate seemingly endless patience in all your group interactions. I suppose one downside to your competence is that you implemented features on this project without asking any questions, such as the Carrier Wave configuration. Since no questions came up, I didn't even realize so much set up went into the gem, and I didn't know how to use it at first. So, for future work, I recommend that if you go off and do your Kyle thing and learn something new, teach it back to the group with a quick walkthrough or something. Overall, I'm very grateful for the chance to work with you. Thank you for providing so many learning opportunities by sharing your knowledge.

From Amy: It was great to get the chance to work with Kyle again on a project. He is a meticulous, tireless worker who is more than willing to put in long hours to finish up a project, and he’s an extremely useful set of extra eyes when hunting for problems. A strong coder with a high-level understanding of everything we’ve learned so far, Kyle helped us through some of the more nuanced parts of the project with ease. Mobile First, now and always! He remains curious about better and more efficient ways of approaching things, which is always a welcome addition to any bit of group code.

From Annie: Kyle, I only wish I could have the attention to detail that you have. I hope that you don't feel that your rigorous code reviews went unappreciated, because I found them to be invaluable. I appreciate your feedback and I am going to model my future group workflow on your example. In addition to this, you clearly have a great grasp on the material we've covered. Moreover, you're always looking for new and better ways to apply what we've learned, which opens the door to the group learning and exploring new content. As we continue together in our cohort, I hope to get to know you more and continue to learn from you. You can be a difficult person to read, but I learned that you're really funny and are passionate about a great many things. I can't wait to work with you again in the future!

### Playing a Part

My primary contributions to the community is probably within my module being an active and positive team member. I ask a lot of questions in class and am actively collaborating with people around me when we run into a roadblock. I'm pretty detail-oriented so I often think of logistical or project questions to ask the instructor that hopefully benefitted everyone else in module 2. I also made myself very available to pair with module 1 students and felt like I was always able to be helpful in the pairing sessions. I am also an active member of the Armstrong posse and attended most of the events and spikes. Lastly I am just a diligent community member in general and tend to do more than my share of dishes and a good job at afternoon chores.
