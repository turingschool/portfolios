# Kyle Heppenstall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main area of emphasis in this module is to figure out what fields and technologies in software developement I'm most interested in. I want to do more exploring of a new language like Python and Elixir. I'm looking forward to working on a personal project and have the goal of consuming and analyzing some data from a couple APIs and then hosting the collected data in my own API. Concerning the community at large, I want to keep pairing with students in Mod 1 and Mod 2 and continue to make more connections with the people in my own module. I also want to continue to attend and contribute something to the Armstrong Posse, hopefully by running a session or a small group focused on learning Python.

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Rales Engine

In this project I worked with Nick E to host our first API. We import business data and host an API with endpoints to return records, relationships between models, and business intelligence as JSON. During our evaluation Sally gave us some positive feedback on our organization structure.  test coverage, queries, and git workflow. Overall, our queries all used ActiveRecord except for our random controllers (`Customer.all.sample`).

Evaluator: Sally

Students: Nick E & Kyle

1. **Completion**

    * 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

1. **Test-Driven Development**

    * 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

1. **Code Quality**

    * 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

1. **API Design**

    * 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

1. **Queries**

    * 3.5: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

### Feedback

From Nick:

It was an awesome experience getting to work with you on Rales Engine.
You quickly grasped the core theories at the heart of the project and were
quick to share your thoughts and ideas.  You were always willing to pause
what you were doing to help out or provide some perspective on a bit of
code.  And it was especially low stress to experiment with a new technique
or structure.  The half-hour of experimentation that we spent in the routes
file ended up laying out the whole structure of our controllers for the
project - kind of awesome.

I was also great to get a chance to pair with you on the business logic.  I
feel like I learned a tremendous amount going through that exercise with
you.

Your attention to detail with the project structure, organizing the spec,
and staying consistent with the project style we established gave the
project a consistent voice, despite the fact there were two of us working on it.

For constructive feedback, if I have to find *some* area where I could
recommend a delta for future projects, I would ask that you share the 
interesting bits you find along the way.  All of us come up against little
code challenges which trip us up for a moment, or maybe we find an elegant
solution to something that had been verbose and unwieldy.  Share those
nuggets of insight with the rest of your team.  You're a tremendous
individual contributor, and you

## Cloney Island

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/kickstarter_clone)
*   [Heroku](https://kickstarter2.herokuapp.com/)

For Cloney Island we built a clone of Kickstarter. I learned about making name-specific many to many relationships and more about authorization - specifically how to secure an API and use a permission PORO. I also got some good practice with styling in. The biggest challege was the size of the team and the related project management and git workflow.

### Feedback

From Robbie: I really enjoyed working with Kyle during this project. I think that his attention to detail is excellent and vital to avoiding bugs. I also appreciated his work ethic. My one piece of feedback, is that when you feel like this is an issue that needs to be addressed, speak up and let's get it fixed instead of ignoring it.

From Drew: Feedback: as ever, Kyle is one helluva programmer. He bring top notch levels of critical thinking, intelligence and raw coding talent to every team he's on. Best yet, he's awesome to work/pair with and there is no problem a team can't figure out without him. Constructive Feedback: Sometimes Kyle can be hard to get a hold of. Communication could be better in larger team environments.

From Dan: I really enjoyed working with Kyle on Cloney Island. Thank you for taking the time to carefully review PRs, make suggestions, and explain your thought process. Although we only paired once, I was able to pick up a lot of useful techniques from your workflow. I really admire the time and effort that you put into refactoring every line of code, even tests. My only piece of constructive feedback is to make sure to speak up whenever you think there might be a better approach. You have great ideas and the whole team benefits from hearing them.

From Jason: I had the pleasure of working with Kyle on Cloney Island. He was a great person to have on our team. He was always available to ask questions and was always willing to pair. He was extremely knowledgeable and I learned quite a bit from him. His attention to detail was amazing and really pushed me to be better. Constructive Feedback: Over all Kyle was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that sometimes there was a time gap between responses on PR comments.

## Personal Project - Happy Trails

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ski-climb/happy_trails)
*   [Heroku](https://pampered-trails.herokuapp.com/)

Nick Erhardt and Kyle Heppenstall created Happy Trails to empower the community of trail users to log trailwork needs and organzize to work on trails. Guest visitors can see trailwork requests on an interactive map and toggle the requests based on status. Once logged in with Strava, a user can see his/her Strava routes and can add an issue. GPS data for issues is added using metadata from the photos or by dragging a marker to a users desired location. Users can comment on issues and administrators can add work days to automatically email participants with the time, location, and details of the day.


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [Markdown Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

During this gear up we spent the first bit of time exploring the Parable of the Polygons interactive blog post. Applying the ideas to tech, if executives (or anyone making hiring decisions) seeks teams were even one third of the members are like them then there will be segregated availabilities according to who is ‘like’ the decision-maker in this case. To be honest I had not though through diversity quotas too much previously. Based on the Potp, it seems essential to have a threshold for the the maximum number of people like you in your area.  Diversity quotas, even if small, could help provide this threshold. Another way to provide this threshold would be through personal expectations. If you are only willing to work at an area with a certain level of diversity, you are steering the trend toward a more diverse workforce.

#### Automation and the Future

*   [Markdown Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

We started this gear up watching a few depressing videos on automation. I found it interesting that the videos suggested professional and creative work being automated at rates similar to the blue collar work I traditionally associated with being vulnerable to automation. In groups we started discussing about the impacts automation could have on society going forward. We discussed options like a more significant safety net, lowering the hours in a work week, universal basic income, and lowering the retirement age. We also raised the idea that society needs to change its concept around unemployment - stop blaming the unemployed and consider the option that the person is without a job to no fault of their own.

#### Universal Basic income

*   [Markdown Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In this gear up we discussed the idea of implementing a universal basic income. I was surprised to read about how more Americans support UBI than are opposed. Personally, although I do like the idea of UBI, it still feels ‘un-American’. I think more and more people are recognizing that automation could escalate quickly and leave millions of people jobless (at no fault of their own). UBI seems like a sensible way to start dealing with a potential crisis of work and identity. However, I know it is going to be uncomfortable for a lot of Americans. As a result starting to have these discussions and staying up to date with the research and branding of the idea will be essential if it is going to work out. I think UBI could be an essential component to preserving dignity and equity as automation progresses and our economy changes.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/1930f63ab3978c60665a0e804cc72d88/edit)

This session was really helpful to think about my priorities when starting to job search. I had not thought too much about the question of what people I like to work with so I enjoyed thinking through what I'm looking for in colleagues. I'm looking forward to using my flower exercise to help with selecting jobs to apply for and interviews.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

This session was definitely helpful in getting some ideas going for the personal project. I actually came up with an idea I used for my personal project during the session. The idea of not rejecting any ideas and running with each one was helpful for me since I tend to be overly selective instead of just brainstorming openly.

#### How to be successful in interviews

This module I did the interview preparation session with Ian Douglas, mock interview with Ian, and attended the fireside chat with Ingrid Alongi. From the fireside chat I learned a bit about the importance writing a unique, fun cover letter to show interest. We also heard about the automated systems for parsing resumes and how it picks out key words and experience. Ingrid also recommended trying to make a connection with the interviewers. From the session with Ian Douglas I got some great practice trying to respond to technical questions and then went on to practice my responses explaining RESTful APIs and the HTTP request / response cycle. Another thing I picked up is just to be mentally prepared and friendly for the interview. Have fun, be nice, and be yourself.

In this session we dove into creating an action plan to find a job. I enjoyed thinking first about priorities and then transitioning into creating a concrete,actionable plan for module 4. Personally it relieved a lot of stress to just create a weekly plan for looking for and pursuing opportunities. That way I know I have a starting point to begin from and can adjust if it doesn't go as well as I hope.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Nick E (Rales Engine): Overall I loved working with you on Rales Engine and hopefully we get to work together again! My constructive from this project is to have more explicit discussions with teammates about the tradeoff between getting something done and doing it as well as possible (importer tests, for example). My positive feedback is that you do an excellent job problem-solving and knowing the tools to troubleshoot. You also do a great job holding people accountable to using specific vocabulary which lets you have higher level discussions about code more easily.

For Drew (Cloney Island): As always, I loved working with Drew on Cloney Island. You are great to pair with and do a awesome job of stating your opinion on the best way to write the code but also staying flexible with the way the work is accomplished. You are also a strong communicator and always available and putting the team first. My only piece of constructive feedback is to always put your best foot forward on a PR. Whether it is a stub or styling, it could be worth it to do it all the way done the first time instead of leaving things to be refactored and fixed up later. Hopefully we get to work together in Mod 4!

For Robbie (Cloney Island): You were a fantastic project manager during Cloney Island and took a lead on writing some of the most challenging code (like the Oauth). I love that you lead by example, workshard, and encourage other people to do the same. My only constructive feedback is to communicate when you refactor so the team can get all on the same page for code quality.

For Dan (Cloney Island): It was great to work with Dan on Cloney Island. You do an awesome job of keeping the big picture in mind and anticipating how the architecture will work a few steps down the road. You are also great to pair with and I definitely enjoyed the time we got to spend pairing together. My only constructive feedback is to keep the git workflow and branches tidy to make smaller, more frequent PRs.

For Jason (Cloney Island): Jason, it was good working together on Cloney Island. You keep things fun and did a great job getting your tasks done and communicating with the team. My only constructive feedback is to shorten your PRs into more discrete chunks so they are easier to read and review.

### Being a Community Member

From Nick E (Rales Engine): Overall I loved working with you on Rales Engine and hopefully we get to work together again! My constructive from this project is to have more explicit discussions with teammates about the tradeoff between getting something done and doing it as well as possible (importer tests, for example). My positive feedback is that you do an excellent job problem-solving and knowing the tools to troubleshoot. You also do a great job holding people accountable to using specific vocabulary which lets you have higher level discussions about code more easily.

### Playing a Part

Overall I felt like I had a positive impact on the community this module, especially within 1610. In general people were more stressed than previous modules, and I think I did a good job keeping a positive attitude, especially during sessions where some of the group may have been a little checked out. I was also diligent in doing my cleaning duties and attended events with the Armstrong posse. I also paired with some mod 1 students and led little session on tries during the complete me project. During group projects I always gave and solicited feedback with my group members. Lastly I was always engaged and present during gear ups and spike sessions on Fridays.
