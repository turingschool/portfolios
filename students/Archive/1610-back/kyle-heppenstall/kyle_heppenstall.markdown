# Kyle Heppenstall - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals for the module are to learn as much as I can and be an effective team member. While working on a team, even if we are frustrated or making progress slowly, I want to continue to put the team first and maintain a solution-oriented attidue. Sometimes I mistakenly prioritize task completion over learning. As a result I want to prioritize asking for help and practicing/repeating to move myself along. Finally I wanted to get more comfortable in the community and start to find my place. I want to pair plenty with people in and outside of my module and make time to be as helpful as I can to the community. One big challenge I am anticipating is staying healthy and making time to cook and exercise.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Overall I feel like I made great progress through my individual projects in the module. As the the projects progressed in difficulty I both struggled and learned more. My biggest takeaway from Date Night were refactoring and improving style. Pairing sessions and PDOOR helped me begin to learn about what strong code can look like. HTTP was the most frustrating project of the module for me, and I learned a good bit about closely following the spec harness / markdown and paying careful attention to syntax with the HTTP responses.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

I worked through iteration 4 making my first web application. This was the first project I made that required many different classes. As a resut I learned a good bit about workflow and extracting classes. I also used modules for this first time - incorporating them as functions.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

41 tests plus 16 server/faraday tests
In the tests and implementation we see small methods with well defined names and clearly implemented code
Room for a bit of edge case work with things like the game
Implementation shows good parallel interfaces to similar objects and overall very good componentization
Scores:

1. Overall Functionality 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

3. Test-Driven Development 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

4. Breaking Logic into Components 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date night was our first big individual project. I retrofitted many of the tests after our lesson on test-driven development. I paired with Ilana and learned a good bit about refactoring and how to improve my style. My biggest struggles on this project were refactoring to improve clarity and writing the health method.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

Two test files, 47 tests total that all pass
Testing is strong, good progressions, some good edge cases
Implementation is strong, small style refactorings
Has delete, leaves, height

1. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

2. Functional Expectations
  4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

3. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some     refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both group projects went well for me this module. Complete Me presented an interesting data structure challenge and I loved thinking through the recursive methods with my parnter. That said, our git workflow was nonexistent and we did not communicate effectively when working remotely. Fortunately Molly and I remedied this problem on Black Thursday and used the git workflow recommended by Mike and Ilana to collaborate effectively. We mainly wrote code together in person but also did a bit of divide and conquer on iteration 3 during some of the repetitive repository creation. Both of my partners provided valuable feedback that I am excited to  implement next module.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

In this project we parsed CSV files and ran data analysis for the online business. We learned most about dividing functionality into classes and modules and keeping organized with all the files. 

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

Tests ran at .89 seconds,
181 runs, 402 assertions
really good organization of tests
used module for analytics
Some minor areas that could be refactored and logic pushed around

1. Functional Expectations 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

2. Test-Driven Development 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation The output from rake sanitation:all shows... 4: Zero complaints

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Amy and I worked together to make the autcomplete using the tries data structure. We learned how to collaborate using git / GitHub and deepend our understanding of data structures and trees. We also learned to populate our automplete with files and figured out how to connect our code to .txt files. We did the delete option and did the SimpleCov extension for the project. As our first paired project I learned a good bit about being a strong team member and setting up expectations for the team to succeed.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

Spec harness: runs, though copied instead of cloned, passes
Project tests do a good job of using multiple perspectives/angles
Watch out for testing the internal functionality -- test the external interface
Tests are well built/implemented
Good inclusion of edgecases
Implementation is very good from a code quality/style standpoint
Built delete and used SimpleCov
Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, refactoring, and extensively uses idiomatic code.

4. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

5. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

## D: Professional Skills

My main takeaways form the professional skills for this module was beginning to build my resume and LinkedIn profile. I had not used LinkedIn previously and it had been a number of years since I had to write a resume. I liked how specific our instructions were and felt like it was straightforward to create my resume and profile after the session. That said this is an area I do not feel too confident in so I am excited to get some feedback on my profile and resume in Module 2.

### Gear Up

I benefited tremendously from the gear ups this module. I really enjoyed talking with students from other modules about important topics like civic responsibility and resilience. My favorite gear up of the module was the introversion and extroversion on teams session. I really appreciated the Ted Talk we watched and the time to talk through the way that society and Turing could be setup to help maximize the potential of both introverts and extroverts.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

From reading the articles I learned that resilience over time is determined by individual, psychological factors and external, environmental factors. Resilience can both strengthen and evaporate. It is not an inherent quality. Resilience stems from how we use our human stress response. What matters is less about the events and more how the person perceives the event. An adverse event perceived as an opportunity to grow does not traumatize a person in the same way as if they perceived it as a traumatizing event. Humans can use stressors as learning opportunities or exaggerate / create additional stressors and lower their resilience. This session gave some mental practices to become more resilient. For example, frame situations in a productive way (if it is raining, think ‘I get wet in the shower anyway.’) Secondly, turn challenges into fun by viewing them as opportunities to succeed.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

One big takeaway for me came from the video. We as a society have a bias against introversion. The idea that creativity comes exclusively from collaboration is faulty. The world is in many ways designed for extroverts even though the whole world stands to benefit from more empowerment of introverts.

Another idea I am taking away from the gear up is the Amazon meeting structure setup by Jeff Bezos. I like the idea of having time to digest and read before conversing, weighing ideas, and making decisions. I also think it is interesting that extroverts lead passive groups better and introverts lead practice groups better. I wonder if a strong leader can change their style depending on the group they are leading.

During our discussion we didn’t arrive at any concrete suggestions for Turing but concluded that introverts and extroverts (from our group at least) feel welcome and like they can be successful. We dove a bit into stereotypes surrounding introverts and disconnecting introverts from shyness and an inability to collaborate.

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Most of my key takeaways from this session happened during our conversation debriefing the articles about vetting leaders and whether we have a responsibility to vote. I was interested to hear the perspective that abstaining from an election can be a conscious way to "vote." We also dove into extending the example from the reading that civic responsibilities and rights should strike a balance to keep individuals and government healthy. After this gear up I'm still motivated to vote but am hoping to do some more research to be more informed about local positions.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/feedback_1.md)
* Deliverable - see feedback in portfolio

We read about three emotional triggers that can happen when receiving feedback and dove into those by discussing how we feel when we receive feedback. We then practiced writing some feedback to implement on our first project.

#### Learning to Pair: Holding Each Other Accountable, and Giving Feedback

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables - DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NymvDNiOQUi6tp7JkjFA4eGKSM1pXh8Wgwxw-yDgAY/edit)

My biggest takeaways from learning to pair were around managing my expectations and how to communicate with another person to match our expectations. From exploring my own strengths, I think I bring a strong ability to focus for extended periods, a flexible schedule, and high accountability for task completion. One thing I am hoping to work on is using the tools Allison provided to effectively deal with conflict in a pair. We practiced having some tough "retro" conversations, and I would like to be able to use those to effectively work through difficult situations with my teams.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I provided Amy with some similar constructive feedback that she provided to me. We did not communicate enough over the weekend so that we ended up with at very different points when we came in on Monday. More frequent check-ins with the partner would have led to higher productivity and less time getting back on the same page when we met up on Monday. I provided her with some positive feedback on her flexibility and ability to notice details about code. I gave her some positive feedback on her ability to balance building a relationship with her partner while creating a really efficient working relationship.

My positive feedback for Molly is that she does a great job asking questions and slowing the team down when needed. She has a great attention to detail that helped us build code that was as versatile and stylish as possible without spending too much time refactoring after the fact. My other piece of positive feedback is that Molly took more ownership of the project as it progressed. My constructive feedback is to understand the scope of the project more thoroughly from the beginning to help drive the team more. Overall Molly was very fun to work with and did a good job keeping the mood light but focused.

### Being a Community Member

Amy provided me with the constructive feedback of around leading with more questions and trying to solicit ideas from partners first before sharing ideas. She also provided some positive feedback that I was fun to work with and had a strong ability to stay focus and keep the overall vision of the project at hand.

Feedback from Molly: "Kyle was a fantastic partner - his skill as a teacher shone through in particular, and I feel that learned an exceptional amount simply from observing how he approached problems - my Ruby game definitely leveled up from working with him. My only piece of constructive feedback to offer would be to not get too swept up in the hype/stress surrounding the project and dial back the intensity of the work in the beginning as we are laying the conceptual foundations. As a partner who was behind him in skill level, the pace was intimidating at times. That being said, once I was confident that I fully grasped the structure of the program, working with him felt very focused but relaxed, which is the sweet spot I think we all aspire to hit in our work! In the end, I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to pair with him on this project."

### Playing a Part

I am proud of the ways that I was able to support some of my classmates on projects. Any time someone asked a question I was willing to take the time to talk it through with them even if I could not directly help or know the bets solution. I'm pleased that we were able to work so collaboratively on projects and felt that the collaborative nature of the projects led to higher learning for the whole module. I was also a fringe member of Armstrong through the module and attended Friday Spikes and a few after school and lunch meetings. I'm hoping to play a greater role in the posse moving forward. Lastly I always did chores with diligence and helped clean up spaces and keep the our space organized by moving furniture around and lending a hand as needed.
