# David Knott - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
<br>
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
<br>
I set out to learn as much as I could here at Turing.  I learned about ruby, programming, and workflow in general these past 6 weeks and I am happy with the progress I've made while realising that I still have a long way to go.  After the first 2 weeks I decided to spend my energy focusing on organizing my thoughts and forcing myself to TDD and now both are starting to become habits.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

 Over the past six weeks I have been taught the value of being methodical.  I have come to accept that although TDD is at times painful and whiteboarding sometimes seems pointless, in the long run it pays off tenfold. I now accept that it is always a good idead to conceptualize beforehand and to make sure I'm on the right track before I'm to far along.

Created a binary tree that takes in a list of movies and scores and orders them according to their score. Then perform analysis on them to determine certain characteristics of the tree such as the maximum score, depth, and health.

(evaluation comments)

Test-Driven Development - Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
Functional Expectations -  Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions.
Breaking Logic into Components - Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
Fundamental Ruby & Style - Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

## D: Professional Skills
 This module taught me how to be an effective team member and how to give and recieve feedback in a cosntructive way.
 I like the idea of Gear Up but I felt that they were very hit or miss in that some led to good conversations and reflexion while others seemed to raise issues without alloting enough time for discussion.

### Gear Up
#### (Vote Your Conscience)
  I gained a lot by discussing politics with a group of people outside of my social circle.  I enjoyed being exposed to their different perspectives.  In the future I will make an effort to stay calm and listen better, to often political discussions turn into a series of personal attacks due to the participants assosciating their politcal views as part of their identity.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)


#### (Introversion and Extroversion on Teams)
 My group was more at ease then usual, most likely because this Gear Up was conducted within everyones own module which created a safer space for the sharing of ideas.  As a result, the conversation my group had was extremely authentic and each member had enough courage to draw on personal experiences from their own lives to add to the discussion.   The main take away from this discussion is that although our culture tends to look down on introverts there are more of them then I had previously thought and they can be just as effective and efficient as an extrovert.

#### (Resilience)
 I didn’t enjoy discussing resilience because the first half of the discussion was spent trying to convince us that it is important which I feel most people particularly those at Turing already knew.  The more interesting question with regards to resilience is how it can be fostered on the individual level,  although we touched on this I didn’t feel comfortable enough with my group to share my personal struggles with regards to resilience.  The discussion did however prompt a significant amount of introspective thought afterwards as to how I can force myself to build healthier habits which I believe would create the best foundation for me to acquire a higher level of resilience.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)

 * [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david1knott)
 
 * [Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/3c7l391te96)

(takeaways from session)
I learned the importantce of personal branding both over the internet and in person and that everything I put out for the world to see should be carefully analyzed beforehand as to the effect it will have on my reputation.

#### Learning to Pair 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

(takeaways from session)
I learned that two eyes are always better than one and that having another person involved is most helpful during the coneptuals stages of a project when attempting to develop a strong foundation.

#### Feedback 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

(takeaways from session)
This was one of my favorite sessions in Turing.  It was incredible to see all of my classmates give constructive feedback with the intention to make one another better.  This was a beautiful expierence.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation
 
  <br>
(feedback to me)
<br>
From Mike(for Complete Me): 
<br>
Overall, you were a great partner for Complete Me.  Being our first partner project, 
we had some awkward learn as we go moments in terms of setting expectations and checking 
in with each other, but we got through it with smiles and positive attitudes. For future 
group projects, I recommend you work on communication. It’s my impression that your thoughts develop very quickly, which makes verbalization difficult. For me as the receiver, your ideas sounded choppy and were hard for me to follow.
<br><br>
On the positive side, I appreciate you fully put yourself out there, expressing your strengths in developing functionality and weaknesses in organization and simplicity. At points where I had developed parts of the project that were ahead of your progress, you always meaningfully contributed to the high-level discussion and low-level implementation of the feature at hand. Lastly, and most simply, I very much appreciate your willingness to show up at 7am each morning this week for pair programming. I think our last two days were especially collaborative and productive because of our commitment to do extra and early work in the beginning.

From Laszlo(for Black Thursday):
<br>
I worked with David on the Module 1 final project Black Thursday. David is a very hard worker and he is always ready to jump in to solve any problems we have. He knows Ruby syntax very well, he has very good understanding of the concept and based on this strong base he doesn’t quickly jumps to solutions, but works on building the best solution possible.
He also demonstrated tremendous empathy and support for a special family situation that arose right before we started working together. He accommodated our crazy family schedule and priorities without a single complaint.
David is very good at quickly bringing a concept to life that allowed our team to spend more time with refactoring and making sure the implementation is as robust as possible.
I would be happy to pair with David again in the future and he will be a great addition to any team he will join for any of his upcoming projects.

From Molly(for working with her during lunch):
<br>
David! I just wanted to saw thank you for your generosity in helping me work through the control flow exercise in class. This exercise caused me to have a minor crisis of confidence when I realized that I was totally lost and struggling through the programs covered in the lesson. You caught on to this and slowly stepped through the lesson with me in great detail, to the extent that you ended up spending nearly all of your lunch hour helping me work through it. Thanks to your awesome teaching I had multiple “lightbulb moments” and was able to identify a huge stumbling block in my learning and work to remedy it. I really appreciated your help :)

### Giving Feedback
<br>
To Mike(for Complete Me):
<br>
 First let me start by saying that it was a pleasure working with you and that I feel lucky to have had you as a partner for our first project here at Turing.  I feel safe saying that the most important part of any group is communication and I felt that our communication improved progressively as the project went on.  I also appreciate your flexibility and understanding of my prior commitments to the friend I had staying in my home.  That being said in the future I would suggest that you consider making micro expectations surrounding project objectives more clear with your partners.  Also, I think our project could’ve gone even better if we had talked sooner about what I could do to add on to what you had initially made.  On the other hand, I did like how we came together towards the second half of the project to polish it off, this step felt much more collaborative to me and your enthusiasm over a nice refactor was enlivening. Overall I enjoyed working with you and learned an incredible amount about organization, testing, and ruby style which has undoubtedly helped me to succeed in other projects. Many thanks.
<br>
To Laszlo(for Black Thursday):
<br>
 Lazlo, I enjoyed working with you and learned a lot from your methodical approach to coding.  I feel that we communicated well throughout project.  I think the biggest challenge we faced was our drastically different work styles, in general I tend to rush into a problem and try to figure things out as I go while you tend to spend more time beforehand, conceptualizing the problem.  Although I feel that at times this difference was a bit frustrating for both of us I think that you handled it very well.  In future projects when you feel frustrated maybe you could try vocalizing your concerns sooner and more directly. I am grateful for the hard work that you put in that enabled us to build a solid foundation which allowed us to fly through later iterations.  I also admire your ability to take a step back when necessary and start from the beginning like you did when we were stuck last Wednesday.  On my next project I will try to have the forethought and perspective to restart as well.  Thanks for a wonderful project and I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you.
 <br>

To Amara:
<br>
 Amara you bring so much to the Turing community, I always feel better after talking to you and I suspect that many of our classmates feel the same way.  I know the past six weeks have been hard for you and I’m happy to see that you maintained a relatively optimistic attitude despite near constant stress.  I can’t help but believe that with your level of intelligence and motivation things will make an ever increasing amount of sense.  Estoy feliz a conocerte
