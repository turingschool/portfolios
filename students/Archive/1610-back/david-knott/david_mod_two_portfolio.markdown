# David Knott - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection
<br>
What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?
<br>
  The biggest thing I learned this module technically was the importance of following conventions, particularly when using a framework like rails, in order to increase readability for others who are expecting certain parts of my program to be in specific files and efficiency for myself because I no longer have to take the time to decide and remember where things go.  Professionally I realised the importance of building up my network and realised that I prefer networking events (such as meetups) followed by outreach to cold outreach because it feels more authentic.

## B: Individual & Group Work
<br>
### Group Projects
<br>
###[Little Shop](https://github.com/riverswb/gryff_outdoor)
<br>
Little Shop has been one of the best projects so far!  I loved the team I worked with because everyone handled what they were supposed to do which allowed us to have fun during the time that we spent together.  Also in terms of the project it's the first one that has real world applications.  Granted it's not amazon, but it is usable and I'm sure that many online store would be happy it use it (lets be honest some of the stores out there now look really bad).
<br>
#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/DavidKnott/bike-share)
<br>
I find data super intersting so I loved analyzing the data in bike share.  The feeling I got after chaining a long sequence of ActiveRecord methods together can only be described as a state of bliss.  That's probably the biggest thing I took from bike share, the realizzation the I like data and the insight that I could see myself being fulfilled  analyzing data.
<br>
1. Functional Expectations
<br>

3.5: Application fulfills base expectations
<br>

2. ActiveRecord
<br>

4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
<br>

3. User Experience and Conventions
<br>

4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.
<br>

4. Code Organization/Quality
<br>

3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.
<br>

5. Testing
<br>

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
<br>

6. Working Collaboratively
<br>

2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
<br>

### Individual Projects
<br>

####[Rails MiniProject](https://github.com/DavidKnott/sophia)
<br>

This is the project where everything clicked
I got super exccited about this project because I decided to make a spinoff of the question and answer forum Quora.  I called it Sophia (latin for wisdom).  I practiced TDD and athentication and started having to think about each step of the proccess, but by the end it was second nature.  I really aprecatiate the freedom that was given to us that allowed my to work on a project the I found so fun!
<br>

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/DavidKnott/job-tracker-2.0)
<br>

1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations
<br>

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.
<br>
2) Routes
<br>

3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.
<br>

3) Controllers
<br>

3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.
<br>

4) ActiveRecord
<br>

3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.
<br>

5) Views
<br>

3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
<br>

6) User Experience
<br>

3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.
<br>

7) Testing
<br>

3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
<br>

## C: Professional Skills
<br>

### Gear Up
#### Micro Aggressions
<br>

This was one of my favorite gear ups because before we talked about micro aggressions I didn't even know they existed.  This gear up helped me see some of my daily actions through a different lense, now I am slightly more aware of what I say and realise the danger that I may say something that seems benign to me but can have a long lasting impact on the well being of another human.  This is particularly true if I am contributing to a systemic problem such as assuming people from one country or another have certain likes or dislikes simply because of their heritage.
<br>

#### Grit: Passion and Perserverance
<br>

I enjoyed this gear up primarily because it took place within my module which allowed me to feel comfortable enough to express myself.  I was a little taken aback by many of our cohorts attitude for the likes of ted talks and other "self-improvement" hacks that will change your life, but after doing some serous self reflection I agree with them in the sense that there are no quick fixes and if someone expects only watching ted talks to change their life they are in for a rude awakening.
<br>

### Professional Development Workshops
<br>

####[Feedback II]https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md
<br>

I use feedback as a way to get my bearings because in the majority of interactions I participate in, I'm only getting half the story.  Usually if I say something that offends someone or act in a way that's unbecoming other people will judge me and decide to reduce the frequency of our interactions.  This is hard for me because I can't improve if I don't know what the problem is.  That's where feedback comes into play, when someone speaks their mind about how they think I'm doing, I can look at it and see if anything they're saying is true. If it is, I can work on it,
E.G:
<br>

David I noticed when your explaining things I sometimes feel losses.
<br>

I can take that piece of feedback and try to explain my ideas in a slower and more tranquil manner.
<br>

#### [Finding Opportunities](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)
<br>

This talk inspired the start of my "networking proccess" I started looking up jobs around the country that seemed cool and got super excited because a lot of jobs ask for the skills that I'm learning at Turing (particularly SQL).  In terms of deliverables, I created a list of 12 companies that were currently hiring junior devs.
<br>

#### [Collaborative Communication](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
<br>

Up until Littleshop I had always worked in groups of two or three and we were working in the same room 80%.  We had dealt with merging to master by agreeing that it only be done when all team members were present.  My Littleshop project was a complete 180 with two members leaving Denver as soon as possible everyday in order to avoid traffic on their bus ride home to Fort Collins.  This led to my group doing 90% of our work indivually utilizing slack, waffle, and github pull request reviewer.  Looking back this was an extremly good oppturunity in terms of learning how to work in a team without actually being together which I'm sure will come in handy many times in the future throughout a (hopeffully long) codding career.
<br>

I love self-improvement and theirfore I love feedback.  Simply put, the more it hurts (if it's given in a constructive manner) the truer it is and the more essential it is that I work on whatever the feedback suggests.  If it was as easy as deciding to work on feedback then I would be near perfect, but it's not. Being a better person through the incorporation feedback into ones life is a constant decision to loosen up ones grip on the pride and identity that the majoriy of us tend to cling on to for dear life and to step into the unknown.
<br>


#### [Cold Outreach](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)
<br>

After the cold outreach talk I took my networkingto the next level.  I quickly became competent at aquiring the emails of developers in companies that I might want to work for in the future and sent them conscise emails inviting them for coffee.  I was a little suprised when some actually tooke me up on the offer (strangers can be amazing people sometimes!).
<br>

### [Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)
<br>

I felt like I had a good understanding of networking  during our practice because the night before I had 3 hours of constant pitching at a networking event. Over the past few days I've been able to transform my routine from a lackluster student at "just another cooding school" who only knows ruby and rails to a junior developer who realizes that although he's new to the industry the passion that lights up his face and his ability to hold decent (some would say life changing) conversations will get him far.
<br>

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback
<br>

To Ethan:
Ethan, I enjoyed working with you this project.  I feel like I can always count on you when I’m having trouble figuring something out and I need a little help.  I admire your determination to practice concepts that you don’t feel as comfortable with (issue 19 was no walk in the park) and your willingness to participate in networking adventures with me at only a moments notice.  I felt like we worked well together on this project in part because you are a very eloquent speaker.  Whenever you explained an issue or offered a solution it was delivered in a manner that was easy to understand and implement.  I’m pumped to code with you in the future!

<br>
To Brett:
Brett you do a wonderful job of keeping our group on track, particularly by reminding us all to use the waffle.  Your bluntness over the course of this project was refreshing because it allowed me to not waste time or mental power wondering how you were “feeling.”  I feel lucky to have gotten the chance to know you better and over the course of this project I’ve come to realize that you have a really good heart (that’s not just fluff, i actually think it). Keep up the good work and I hope to work with you again on another project.
<br>

To Jesse:
Jesse you were the calming wind of the group, you injected humor into every conversation which was vital to maintaining group moral.  In terms of your contributions to the groups workload I couldn’t help but notice that you constantly volunteered to do any issue that came up on the waffle board and were always eager to be a second set of eyes. In other words keep doing what your doing and you’ll go far. It was a pleasure and an honor to have completed little shop with you.
<br>

To Eric:
Eric, I love your inquisitive nature, wether it be while pairing or talking about more personal matters (I still remember the conversation we had before Christmas break fondly) I always leave my conversations with you feeling more grounded.  Looking back on our project I think it would’ve been helpful if you asked more questions during the project when you didn’t feel completely  comfortable with the material because although we did need to finish the project I would’ve been happy to spend time attempting to explain anything you were fuzzy on.   Overall I’m happy with how our project turned out and I would be excited if I saw our names together for a future project.
<br>

To Nick:
Nick, you inspire me.  Straight and simple I love your energy and optimism about going into the machine learning and data science industries.  Your passion leads me to reflect more about what job  would make my eyes light up with enthusiasm day after day.  In terms of our project together I felt that you were a huge asset because whenever I felt stuck you helped keep the ball rolling forward.  Lastly, our website looks amazing because of your styling which I appreciate a lot because styling is one of the things I struggle most with.  Bravo!

### Being a Community Member
<br>

From Ethan:
David: It seems like solving the logic problems behind most of this back-end stuff is really intuitive for you, so I think it’s been a huge advantage having you in our group. I’ve never seen any problem that’s made you visibly frustrated, and that’s a great asset for working on a team. I’m looking forward to working/networking more with you in the second half!
<br>

From Brett:
Brett you do a wonderful job of keeping our group on track, particularly by reminding us all to use the waffle.

Keep up the good work and I hope to work with you again on another project.
<br>

From Eric:
I worked on Bike-Share with David. Whenever I'm around him, I feel he's about to explode with energy. His intensity is a great asset to any team. He loves his work and it shows. He's a bottomless well of idea for how to solve an issue. A de-bugging machine, really. At moments, I felt out of the loop on his thought process and subsequently lost my bearings.
<br>

From Nick:
Working with David was a pleasure. He’s intelligent, knows his material, and is not afraid to take on challenging problems. 100% reliable. David came through multiple times with unique solutions by diving deep into ActiveRecord, which improved the overall outcome of our project immensely. Always a fun guy to be around, even while banging his head on the computer for hours trying to figure out what broke our database. Look forward to continue learning and building code with this guy.
<br>

## E: Community Participation
<br>

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?
<br>

I participated by going to Hack the Dot (a hackathon in the Turing basement), pairing (once for 4 hours), duing my cleaning duty, by making coffee whenver it's empty, and by bringing an uplifting attitude to the Turing community on a daily basis.  I would say my biggest contribution is that passion and energy I bring to everything (okay 80%) of what I do.
