## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Casey

## Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

-   3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

-   3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

-   3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Testing

-   3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 5. User Interface

-   3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 6. Workflow

-   3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

-   I participated in facilitating a Gear Up. I thought it wasn't to bad of a
    experience. I would have prefered to work on a more meaningful Gear Up though. It
    seemed like most people enjoyed the automation on and I would have liked to
    have put my effort into one of the ones that were not good.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Mike S.:

-   I enjoyed working with Schutte on part one of the Quantified Self project. He picks up concepts pretty dang quick, and I appreciated his patience and willingness to help me understand.

#### To Nick G:

-   Thanks for showing me the ropes with Solidity. I appreciated your patience with all of my questions and your willingness to teach.
    I already said this to Jesse, but I wanted to say it to you as well.
    Thanks for picking up the slack when I was doing my interviewing stuff.

#### To Jesse S.:

-   Hey man, I enjoyed working with you. I appreciated how laid back you were and also how hard you worked.
    Thanks for being understanding with my interviewing stuff I had going on.

### Receiving Feedback

#### From Mike S.

-   I really enjoyed working with you on Part 1 of Quantified Self.
    I was a little hesitant to take on all the challenges that you were keen to, but
    I'm super glad you pushed us to not use jQuery. I really respect your drive to
    learn things deeply and understand what's going on. At the same time, I think
    that need to understand everything can sometimes slow down productivity. My only
    suggestion for future projects is to reflect on what is essential to know, and
    what can be figured out at a later time. Thanks again for being such a solid
    partner during our endeavors into the painfully wordy world of Vanilla
    JavaScript.

#### From Jesse S.

-   Robbie: was really great working with you, this group rounded out my pairing
    with every classmate. I had been looking forward to working with you and am
    glad that I got that chance on this self exploratory project of ours. Huge
    thanks for all your time in the tests. I know that diving into a new framework
    and testing it is never easy, and I wanted to make sure to thank you again.
    Also an even bigger thanks for our talks on jobs, school and just life in
    general. You are great company and conversation.

#### From Nick G.

-   Robbie, it was great working with you. You're upfront, don't beat around the bush,
    and always keeps a persistent mindset to  move forward. This project wasn't perfect, 
    but you were willing to put in extra work to grasp new and confusing concepts, which 
    must have been especially challenging in midst of the mod4 chaos. Thanks for jumping on team blockchain!

### Being a Community Member

-   I paired a lot with people from mod 1 and I also paired with people from mod 3.
