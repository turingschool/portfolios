# Robbie Smith - (M2) Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

I felt like I have a strong enough understanding of MVC, rails, and postgres to start applying to jobs. It has been pretty sweet to actually see the work we do actually on the web.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Sal

Student: Robbie

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

* 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

* 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

* 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [ Bike Share ]

If the project was graded, add your evaluation scores and notes. If the project was not graded, add a reflection.
## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3.5: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* 3.5: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### [Little Shop](https://timber-shop.herokuapp.com/)

### Individual Projects

#### [ Job Tracker ](https://job-tracker-smith.herokuapp.com/)

### 1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.
### 2. Routes

3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.
### 3. Controllers

3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.
### 4. ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.
### 5. Views

3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
### 6.User Experience

3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.
### 7.Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Session Name

#### Micro-aggression

* I didn't learn much from the micro-aggression session. My take away was that the gear up did not draw the line between people being overly sensitive and "micro aggressions". I agree that there are things that could be defined as micro aggressions, but as a whole the micro aggression gear up did not allow for balanced discussion.

#### Grit 

* My take away from this gear up is that I'm tired of pop psychology. I don't think this definition of grit is useful and that it is easy to have "grit" when your passionate about something. It seems like no one wants to talk about what grit really is and that's perserverance when things suck and you aren't passionate about it. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Cold Emailing)

 * I appreciated the cold emailing class, it was nice to learn the basic of it and practice with other people. Having other people give constructive feedback to me was helpful. For the deliverables, I sent seven emails.
 
#### (Networking)

 * I enjoyed this class. It was good to practice networking with people here and Turing. I think hope that there will be more "mock" networking classes.
 
#### (Finding Opportunities)

 * I liked this class because I had no idea how to do this or where to look for opportunities.
 
#### (Feedback II)

* This class was okay, but I don't think it really covered how to give critical feedback and it would have been nice to discuss that more.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

 * To Brett R :I appreciated working with Brett. It was really nice to be in a group where we could discuss matters openly and freely without having to worry about someone taking something the wrong way. I also really appreciated his work ethic and I hope I can work with him again.
 
 * To Dan R : I really enjoyed working with Dan during the bike share project. He is a strong, hard worker, with a lot of really good ideas. It is also nice that he is accepting and open to discussing ideas. His attitude promotes a healthy environment. I really look forward to working with Dan and having more conversations with him.
 
 * To Nick E : It was good working with Nick over the course of the little shop project. He is incredibly smart and I learned a ton from working with him during this project. I was able to increase my knowledge on everything from github to databases and that is pretty sweet.
 
 * Casey M : So, I had the pleasure of pairing with Casey several times over the course of the module and it was always a good experience. It is nice to see how hard she works, and every time we paired together she was always ready to work. I think that we could use more people like her. She was always open to constructive criticism and provided thoughtful feedback.
 
 * Caroline P : You're a database queen. This is my second project with Caroline, and I am still amazed at how thorough she is in her work. Everytime I have worked with you, you have definitely made my knowledge increase.
 
 * Lucy L: For the little shop project, I really appreciated Lucy's calm demeanor and work ethic she brought to the group. I also would like to say that I appreciated her taking the time to help me learn some more about html/css.

### Being a Community Member

 * Robbie has been incredibly welcoming to Mod 1 students from our first day forward. He created the pairing google sheet for us which was extremely effective and enabled us to easily schedule a time to get help from Mod 2 students. I was fortunate enough to pair with him early on and continued to do so throughout the module because of how helpful he was, especially when it came to mapping out huge projects like Headcount. I'm so grateful to have serendipitously paired with Robbie based on who worked with my schedule, he pointed me towards the Practical Object Oriented Design book my first week which really helped with my conceptual learning at the beginning. - Casey M
 
 * Robbie is the king of refactoring. It's like he has a photographic memory of all the code in a project. In our Little Shop project he was constantly noticing and calling out places where we'd written redundant code, and he took it upon himself to refactor and clean up the project. It was a really large project that could have gotten very messy if we didn't have him focusing on good clean code. This was my second project working with Robbie and again I'll say that out of everyone in our class he is one of the strongest when it comes to knowledge of ruby. He is able to constantly implement the cleanest code solutions. - Caroline P
 
 * I was really excited to work with you for bike share because I thought we would work well together, I was not disappointed.  I really appreciate how you helped me with some refactoring and duck typing.  Although it wasn't an issue, remember to talk about your direct methods of communication when DTRing with future groups. - Brett R
 
 * I was very excited to discover that Robbie was on my team for Little Shop. As I've been getting to know him in class I always appreciated his strong work ethic, thirst for knowledge and creative approach to solving programming problems. Working with Robbie on Little Shop was an excellent learning experience. I respect his desire for clean code and refactoring-as-you-go approach. Robbie is always willing to share the gems of knowledge he has researchedand is constantly working to improve his craft. I hope to get paired up with Robbie in the future and tackle something big. He's a solid partner and produces excellent work for the team. - Nick E
 
 * During Little Shop you were an incredibly versitile and efficient member of our team. You are great at assessing a situation and determining when using a tool is the best solution. I learned a lot from working with you and appreciate your dedication and work ethic. You were a leader in clarifying our code, and  my learning has definitely benefitted from pairing with you over the past two weeks. - Lucy L
 
 * I believe that Robbie is a very talented developer who will only continue to get better. He’s one of the hardest workers in our cohort. His ability to find creative solutions, whether it’s using a Gem we’ve never heard of in class or utilizing Structs to finish up a tricky method is very impressive. I’d be very happy to work with him again in the future. - Dan R.


## E: Community Participation

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?
 * I headed up the pairing between mod 1 and mod 2 this go around. I also tried to pick up things and clean up (aside from the chores). And I joined the turing lab possee.

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback
