Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed Rails Engine solo.

#### (Rails Engine)

## Project Rubric

**1. Completion**

-   3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

-   4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

-   3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

-   3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

**4. Queries**

-   4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
-   3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.


-   Score is in between a 3 & 4. While you didn't drop down to ruby enumerables,
    you aren't making the best use of ActiveRecord relationships in some of the
    queries. Ie #favorite_customer and #favorite_merchant. Almost to 4!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Cloney Island)

-   [Cloney Island](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/kickstarter_clone.git)

    Tried to recreate a lot of the functionality from the Kickstarter website

### Completion

  **Client Expectations**

-   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
-   3: As expected

    **User Experience**

-   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
-   2.5: As expected
-   2.5: Below expectations

    **Organization**

-   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
-   3.5: As expected, but great

### Technical Evaluation

  **Git Workflow**

-   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
-   4: Better than expected

    **Test Quality**

-   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
-   4: Better than expected

    **Code Quality**

-   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
-   4: Better than expected

    **Bonus**

    We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

-   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
-   0: No

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### (Tragedy of the commons)

-   [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
-   Takeaways


-   I don't think hiring someone based on their skin color, sexual orientation,
    or gender identity is okay. If people want to increase diversity, then let's
    fix our broken educational system and increase the pool of qualified
    applicants for a position.

#### (Automation)

-   [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
-   Takeaways


-   I didn't "take" much away from this. I thought the topic was interesting,
    and that it was controversial enough to promote a passionate discussion. I did
    have interesting conversations with people which was nice.

#### (Universal Basic Income)

-   [Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)
-   Takeaways


-   I didn't get much out of this. It felt like it was just rehashing the topic of
    the last gear up.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

-   To Drew: This was my first project with Drew and I really enjoyed working with him. I think he brought a good energy to the team and I appreciated his flexibility and willingess to get things done.

-   To Kyle: I really enjoyed working with Kyle during this project. I think that his attention to detail is excellent and vital to avoiding bugs. I also appreciated his work ethic. My one piece of feedback, is that when you feel like this is an issue that needs to be addressed, speak up and let's get it fixed instead of ignoring it.

-   To Jason: This was my first project with Jason. I enjoyed working with him and appreciated his flexibility and willingness to work hard. I donâ€™t have much else to add.

### Being a Community Member

-   Cloney Island Feedback!: You were a fantastic project manager during Cloney Island and took a lead on writing some of the most challenging code (like the Oauth). I love that you lead by example, workshard, and encourage other people to do the same. My only constructive feedback is to communicate when you refactor so the team can get all on the same page for code quality. - Kyle

-   I had the pleasure of working with Robbie on Cloney Island. For this project he was the project manager. He was great to work with always making sure we were on track to finish and keeping up on who was working on what and how it was going. He took on Facebook Oauth which was a massive undertaking. He showed a tremendous work ethic throughout this project.

    Constructive Feedback: Over all Robbie was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that our group as a whole would have fluctuations in our communication with each other (especially in response to comments on PR). - Jason

-   Robbie is an excellent leader and coder. This was his first project as
    project manager, and he performed admirably. I admire his dedication to the
    red-green-refactor stratagem and would be happy to work with him again. - Drew

### Playing a Part

-   Much like the previous mods, I tried to help keep the place tidy and help
    people when they asked for help.
