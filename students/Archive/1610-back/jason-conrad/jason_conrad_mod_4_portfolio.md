# (Jason Conrad) - (M4) Portfolio

## Final Assessment
### Pass

### 1. Satisfactory Progress
* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don’t drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 5. User Interface
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 6. Documentation (NOT GRADED)
* 1: Project has insufficient documentation**

### 7. Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.**

## Group Work

### Quantified Self Week 1

Quantified Self was the first project of Module 4. I worked on this project with Annie and David. This project really pushed back
on what I knew thus far about programming as there was no backend to work with for this project. 

1. Specification Adherence
3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

2. Testing
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

3. HTML/UI
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

4. JS syntax and Style
2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.

5. Git Workflow
4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with 
good context and conversation

6. Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's work. Team is 
documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.

### Feedback from Quantified Self Week 2
"Hey Jason, I highly suggest you find some time over the next few weeks to add AJAX calls. I’m glad you were able to get your
db setup, but I think there’s a ton of value in practicing connecting your frontend with your backend. Unfortunately, if you 
don’t have your API deployed, you won’t really be able to connect the two.

As far as other feedback goes, I think what you have is solid. You could definitely do some refactoring to make your code more
OO and follow the MVC pattern. You could extract out some of the db actions (create, read, update, etc.) into their own 
individual “controller” like files to encapsulate the functionality.

Good work on this. Again, I encourage you to find some time (if not in the next few weeks, then post-Turing) to practice 
connecting your frontend with your backend"

### Capstone Sprint 2

For our Capstone I worked Molly, Laszlo, and Daniel. Capstone brought about a new challenege I had never experienced before, working
with someone else's codebase. That brought about all sorts of challenges: trying to figure out the logic other people were using when 
they created something, dealing with the desire to refactor everything (and being able to distinguish what actually does need to be refactored
not just what you want to refactor), and the battle between sticking with the conventions created or writing in what you consider to be good form.
Once those lessons were learned we were really able to focus on building up the project and adding features.

1. Project Management
4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions

2. Completion & Pace
3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

3. Implementation Quality
3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

4. Application of Techniques
3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.

5. Documentation
4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor

6. Accessibility
3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.

### Capstone Sprint 3
1. Project Management
3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime

2. Completion & Pace
3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

3. Implementation Quality
3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

4. Application of Techniques
3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.

5. Documentation
3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

6. Accessibility
3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.

## Open Source
For my open source contribution I decided to add a How I Met Your Mother Faker Extension. I also confirmed a bug in one of their 
extensions, below are my PR and blog post.

## Feedback & Community

## Community Involvement

* This mod I was apart of a group that helped lead a gear up session. We spent the first 2 gear ups of the mod panning what we 
were going to do during our session. When It finally came time to lead the Gear Up I was really impressed with the people in 
our session and their willingness to discuss the topic of Automation. It was really interesting to see how some people's level
of excitement went down after watching the videos.

* During this mod I also paired with lower mod students on multiple occasions. One of my favorite sessions was the first week 
of the mod I sat down with 9 mod 1 students and we walked through SuperFizzBuzz together. It was really fun to see them asking
a bunch of questions and wanting to try and figure out the problem, and seeing the lightbulbs when they realized how to do 
something.
