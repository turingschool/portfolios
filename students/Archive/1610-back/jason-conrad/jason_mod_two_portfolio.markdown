# (Jason Conrad) - (M2) Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

I thoroughly enjoyed Mod 2 overall. One of the biggest things I didn't like about mod 1 was being very limited in seeing seeing what it was that my work was doing (in a visual return). Mod 2 was great in with some basic HTML and CSS you could immediately go take a look at what it was you created and if you were proud enough of it you could show your family. AS the mod progressed I gained a huge admiration and respect for Rails and all that is does for you and how it can make a massive project a lot easier then it would've been if you had to create everything by hand.

I've tried to make testing a focus since I repeated mod 1. At the beginning of mod 2 i struggled getting into the habit of TDD and truly reading the errors given to me. I feel as the mod has progressed and my comfort level with Rspec has grown that so has my level of comfort with TDD in Rspec has grown.

From a professional level the mod really pushed the limits of my comfort level (especially when it comes to contacting strangers). That being said I really feel like I learned a lot in regards to getting myself out there in the job market and look forward to practicing it even more in the future.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluator: Casey

Student: Jason

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

 * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 * 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/jdconrad89/bike-share)

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

* 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

5. Testing


* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/jdconrad89/job-tracker)

Rubric

1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

2. Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

3. Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

4. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

5. Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

6. User Experience

* 2: The application has limited styling, and it may not be clear how to navigate the application.

7. Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Aggressions
While the conversations that I had in my group were really good, I feel like some of the articles kind of misrepresented the topic. In my personal opinion I feel like some of the examples that were given were far from what i would consider a micro-aggression and in fact flat out racism. It could make someone think if that is what is considered a micro-aggression then I'm doing fine and have nothing to worry about. That being said I will say that the gear up definitely got the conversation started.
### Gear Up
#### Journey Mapping

Overall I enjoyed this gear up, it really forced me to work on listening intently to others and actually paying attention to the details of what they were saying. As I've progressed further into mod 2 and had more interaction with user stories I've realized not only the importance of needing to be able to break stories down in to the smallest pieces possible but the amount of work that goes into getting the information in order to know what it is that the customers are looking for.

### Gear Up
#### Grit

I really appreciated doing this gear up with my cohort. Overall i don't think that grit is the word to describe what it was that we were talking about however, to me grit lends the feeling that you are continuing because you have no other choice. I personally think a word like "zeal" might've been more appropriate. That being said I feel like once we got past the word itself we definitely had conversation as a group around things that drove us here at school.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Finding Opportunities)

This was a very informative workshop. For the most part I had only really thought about building my network on LinkedIn with the few people I already knew in the Tech Industry and Turing students. This workshop really showed me how to leverage all of the features that LinkedIn has to offer and how to build a list of potential opportunities

#### [Job Tracker](https://trello.com/b/FgMMYnZX/jason-conrad-job-tracker)

#### (Collaborative Communication)

As we were about to embark on our first group project I found this session quite helpful. Coming from a management background I had a lot of experience dealing with the types of situations that were demonstrated in the session but it was informative to hear other peoples perspectives on how to handle situations.

Immediately following this session we went into the Bike Share project where I was our project manager. I created a slack channel for us so that we could use this for communication and tried to make sure that people were communicating what it was that they were doing and how it was going so that we always knew where we were on the project. For a large portion of the project we did really well on keeping that communication up, unfortunately towards the end of the project we still communicated what it was we doing but less of how we were doing on it.

Some of the feedback that I got back was to be more communicative of what I was struggling with so they could help me if I needed it and also that sometimes when I put my headphones in to concentrate I come across as unapproachable. In my most recent project I made it a priority to voice my struggles and if i was working with other people in my group around to either have one earphone out or to tell them "I'm going to put my headphones on to concentrate on this but if you need me just tap my shoulder."

#### (Feedback II)

This session was helpful in it was more descriptive in how to create feedback that is actually productive and not just potentially inflammatory. By adding actual facts and your feelings in regards to it it promotes a rational conversation around said feedback as opposed to just causing people to get defensive.

#### (Cold Outreach)

I had a little difficulty with this session, not with crating the emails but with the sending them out to strangers, it definitely pushed my comfort limits. That's not to say that I did't recognize the importance of doing it or the benefits as well. Im excited to see what kind of returns that this will bring as I get responses.

#### (Networking)

This was a very interesting topic to discuss. I always have found myself hesitant to walk up to strangers and essentially pitch myself to them. I also struggled with what it would be that I would say to people in regards to myself. I got a lot of good feedback from classmates on things to say to people (embracing my past in customer service to my benefit). I'm looking forward to the deliverables from this session (going to networking events).

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

### Feedback given to Amara Lovato

I am really impressed with the way that Amara stepped up and was a leader in her cohort this mod as a repeater. She truly lead by example every chance
that she got. She was always asking questions and seeking out help. I really appreciated seeing her willingness to help others. Her bright personality was always a welcome sight and she was always willing to talk about anything, even if it had nothing to do with school. I not only consider Amara a good classmate but also a good friend. I can't wait to see all that she can accomplish at Turing!

### Feedback given to Eric Wahlgren-Sauro

I had the privilege of working with Eric on the Little Shop project. For this project Eric was our Project Manager, and he was quick to get us on
task as far as getting the repository and waffle set up, and getting us started on breaking down the user stories into actionable waffle cards and wire-framing our layout. Eric was always willing to pair on things that people might be struggling with. He always kept us on track and would check in with us on how it was going with the piece that we were working on, offering his help, while still working on his pieces. I would definitely work with Eric again.

### Feedback given to Marisa Burton

I had the chance to work with Marisa on Little Shop. From the beginning I saw how willing she was to put in the work and dive in to things that
we had little experience with. She and I spent probably 5+ hours on Screenhero during our "Remote Day" researching and trying to figure out how to set up
the cart. She was always more than willing to take things on and make sure that they got done (which with a project that has as much in it as Little Shop had was always greatly appreciated) When stresses would be high where tempers might normally flare she always kept cool (singing George Michael's Careless Whisper as her calming mantra when we were trying to avoid a large 'Git'tastrophe. I would definitely work with Marisa on a project again

### Feedback given to Nick Erhardt

I had the privilege of working with Nick on Bike Share. Almost immediately I was impressed with his knowledge and understanding of how to do some of the things required to do for our project. He was always willing to pair if people were having issues and was always looking into new and interesting ways to do things. Both in the production and the testing. He was always willing to take the time to slow down and explain something if someone didn't understand exactly what it was that we were doing. I learned quite a bit from him on the project. His willingness to put in long days and work on something was also very appreciated.  I would be more than willing to work with him again.

### Feedback given to Molly Brown

I had the privilege of working with Molly on the Little Shop project. From the start she showed her willingness to take something on, as the first day
she started the basic design setup of the website so that we could design it as we implemented functionality. She was always willing to help out
if someone was running into an issue and was also helping us keep focus in the moments where our resolve was starting to fade. She also made
sure that she had worked on both functionality and styling to get as much as she could out of this project. I would definitely work with Molly again!

### Feedback given to Lucy Conklin

I had the pleasure of working together with Lucy on Bike Share. She was always willing to take on something that we didn't really know about. Her willingness to try new things was always a great asset to our group. In those moments where we would be stuck on something she would always be quick to say "How about we try this?" or "Have we done it this way?", it was always amazingly helpful to keep the pace going even if we were stuck on something. She also was always willing to pair with us on the styling of the project which was also great! I would be more than willing to work with her on a project again.

### Feedback given to Amy Kintner

I had the pleasure of working with Amy on Bike Share. From the get go Amy was eager to have her hand in as many parts of the project as she could. She was always willing to help out in areas where we were having issues and was more than happy to take on a larger chunk of functionality. She was always looking for new ways to do things which was very beneficial in the times when we would get stuck. Her willingness to work long hours and to push through roadblocks was a great benefit for the team and I would be more than happy to work with her again.

### Being a Community Member

### Feedback from a Amara Lovato

Jason is such a committed and great member of the Turing community. He is always eager to give you a hand and answer any question about Ruby, projects and the school in general. He is also well informed of what’s going on and if he doesn’t know he finds out to provide you that information. In addition to that,  as last mod he plays a relevant role connecting mods and students/staff. He is always available on Slack and it’s so fast answering, he has been definitely a SOS person in many occasions for me. He is very supportive with other students, especially when they are personally struggling and feeling anxious about the possibility to repeat. He listens to them with attention, shares his experience and give you arguments about the benefits of doing what’s better for you having a growth mindset to adapt your initial plans. He is definitely a inspiring person and great friend to many of us.

### Feedback from Eric Wahlgren-Sauro

Jason is the undisputed pop-culture guru of the co-hort. His light-hearted approach to our work, married with intense desire to push forward struck the perfect balance on Little-Shop. When doing our DTR as a group, and struggling to come up with an idea for the store, Jason perked up with the idea of doing all things mini for our Little-Shop project. Once he gets excited about something, he's off to the races. He scrolled through six pages of Google results to find a perfect video on setting up a cart for our project. He seeded all the data and had fun doing it.

### Feedback from Marisa Burton

Jason was a pleasure to work with on Little Shop. He is a hard worker and is amazing at debugging and solving some of our tougher problems. We paired together on some of the cards, and I learned a lot working with him. Jason was a pleasure to work with, always cracking jokes and making coding fun. I really enjoyed multi-tasking and discussing football with him while taking a break from a debugging issue we were having.

### Feedback from Nick Erhardt

I'm glad I got a chance to work with Jason on Bike Share.  I knew him from class as a rather jovial jokester.

Working with him on the project revealed that he has a fierce work ethic and will simply delve in deeper if he gets stuck or doesn't understand
something 100%.  

One afternoon we paired on some of the forms for Bike Share, and it might have been the most in-depth look at forms/parameters/controllers that I've
had during my time at Turing.  I walked away with a much better understanding of how information from forms gets passed around, and that
was due to Jason's tireless work effort and tremendous research he had done.

In short, it was great to get a chance to work with Jason, and the guy truly never quits.  I have a lot of respect for that attitude.

### Feedback from Molly Brown

Jason did an amazing job contributing to every single aspect of our project. He was always willing to pair with any of us to work through issues we were having. I also appreciated his ability to find a way to make mundane tasks enjoyable - he took on the work of building a seed file for our database and ended up writing hilarious descriptions for all our items which totally added to the appeal of our site. Most of all I was impressed with his unflagging work ethic - every evening Jason continued to work on and update the rest of the group with functionality he had added to the site. I think Jason is a super versatile team member and will continue to be a real asset to any team he is a part of.

### Feedback from Lucy Conklin

Thanks for taking on the important challenge of project manager during bike share. You were an important part of our team's success, and I'm glad I got to know you better over the course of the project. I definitely appreciated both your attitude and dedication. I also really love your design work. You clearly have an eye for color and design, and I look forward to seeing how you apply your skills!

### Feedback from Amy Kintner

Feedbacks for you! Jason was our PM for Bike Share, and he was very organized with getting things set up for us at the beginning of the project. Over the first weekend, we all created stations as a group and then Jason and I worked to get an “import” method or larger seed file up and running, and I enjoyed the opportunity to pair with him on this. He also handled trips, which ended up being a monster of a task for one person! He’s more than willing to put in long hours to do whatever it takes to finish a job, and he remains curious about better ways to do things, which is always a big help.

## E: Community Participation

Over the course of this mod I was a representative of my cohort on the SAB, I attended weekly meeting and helped lead retros. I took place in weekly pairings with Mod 1 students and on multiple occasions would open up more slots to help them when they had questions. I was also an active member of the Impostors lunch. I also attended Turing Lab meetings.
