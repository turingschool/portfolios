# (Jason Conrad) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Repeating this module I went in with the mindset that I was going to work on the areas that I struggled with in the previous mod (specifically breaking things down into smaller components and testing as much of my work as I could). I feel like overall I definitely made large strides to bettering myself in those regards. I also went in with the expectation that I was going to be a much larger part of the community, both in my cohort and in the school as a whole. I feel like overall I was far more involved (and for the better might I add) in the community this time around.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Mastermind)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/jdconrad89/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that implemented the classic game mastermind with an interactive REPL.

Notes:

6 tests, all passing 42 percent coverage
Opportunities to refactor
Look at making methods accept arguments and return values in order to make testing easier.
Computer is the master class, and all functionality lives with in it.
Would like to have seen more division of classes, perhaps one for the board, one for messages, another one for the calculation of guesses and the secret.
Avoid using so many instance variables, and setting them to all have the attr_accessor
Score:

## 1. Test-Driven Development
2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

## 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

## 3. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

## 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

## 5. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections


## C: Group Work & Projects
### Projects

#### (NightWriter)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/jdconrad89/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The purpose of this project was to create a program that could encrypt a message written in a txt file into it's braille equivalent in another txt file and then decrypt it back to english in a third txt file.

Notes:

Successfully converts either way
11 tests, one failing test
FILE IO tests aren't meaningful
Remember that each method should have its own tests.
Remember to add edge cases for tests
Numerous methods are missing corresponding tests
I like the fact that the dictionaries are broken, out but use constants and test it.
Watch CRs and spacing, use of them makes code more readable.

Scores:
## 1. Test-Driven Development
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

## 2. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

## 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

## 4. Overall Functionality
2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

## Partners Feedback:
Jason, it was great working with you. I really liked that you were always ready to stop for as much as needed to answer my questions and you took into consideration all my suggestions. Although there was a big gap of knowledge between us you were very supportive and doing your best to make me feel as a contributor. You were also very adaptable and understanding trying to accommodate our schedules. Some things that could improve for future pairs would be to dedicate more time to whiteboard in order to discuss strategy, see the steps and go through little pieces together. The pace was too fast for me so it was hard for me to catch up but at the same time I understand that there was a rush to progress to finish the project on time. Reviewing the code together and making sure that we were in the same page would also have been useful. But globally speaking, it was a very positive experience and I’m happy that I was paired with you because you are a great classmate and a very talented teacher.

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma was based on the Enigma encryption machine from WWII. The purpose of this project was to read a file encrypt it using a generated key and the current date and to print that out into a new file. We then needed to revers the functionality of the encryption machine and to also create a program that would be able to crack the message given only the date.


While we were not evaluated for this project I really wanted to put it in my portfolio as I was really proud of the work that Jesse and I were extremely focused on breaking things down and testing as much as we could.
Also given the fact that I was unable to finish the project in about a weeks time last module I am proud of the fact that we had a finished project with the extension completed in about 2 days.

##Feedback given by Jesse Shipley

Jason and I were paired during the second half of the secret week at Turing. I think we were both surprised to be given a full project, with only a few days to accomplish it. Jason and I began running through our DTR process. This was my second DTR process at Turing and Jason's enthusiasm and energy really helped get us started. I greatly appreciated the passion he conveyed for the project and the pairing. Jason's speed and attention to detail during the white boarding process was inspiring. He drew a flow chart that was easily understandable and involved any and all feedback into the creative process. It truly felt like the best kind of collaboration, even before any progress was made in our text editors. Without Jason's enthusiasm, passion, and desire to build something great this project may have become daunting, or even worse not taught us a few valuable lessons along the way. I would welcome Jason's spirit and cooperation in any future group.

#### (Black Thursday)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

Black Thursday was a project we completed in the final two weeks of our first module of our time at Turing. The purpose of Black Thursday was for us to create a database that sorts through and analyzes many different aspects of the business of merchants on the Etsy website.

##Feedback from my partner

"I really enjoyed working with you to make this sea of data more comprehensible. We started out with a rather slow pace in order to deeply understand the scope of the project, and I think you'd agree that move fully paid off. For future improvement, I recommend you pay more attention to the fine details. Some of the project could be implemented with copy-paste and a few modifications, which is great, but it led to some syntax problems down the road due to
mismatched and/or duplicated naming. I'm very proud of the quality of our project, and I'm especially grateful
for your hard work that allowed us to finish early and relatively stress-free. Thank you for staying late from the get-go and completing all of your responsibilities in a timely manner. Best of luck on future projects!"

## D: Professional Skills

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Personal Branding pt 1)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-conrad-885731130)

This time around for professional skills I tried to get as much as I could out of resume and LinkedIn session. Last time I was so surprised at how different of a process it was for the tech industry compared to other industries that I didn't leave with as much comfort in that area as I would have liked. I look forward to implementing a lot of what was talked about during that session and seeing how it benefits me in the long run.

#### (Feedback)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

This session was very helpful as it made me realize there is a difference between feedback being constructive and giving feedback just for the sake of giving it. There is a right way and a wrong to go about giving feedback and going about it the wrong way can be quite damaging.

#### (Learning to Pair)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

This was a very useful project and one thatI feel like it will be very beneficial down the road when we enter the workforce. Working well with people in a high stress situation. It was also helpful to show us different tools of how to pair and work together.
### Gear Up
#### (Voting)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I'm not going to lie, I was very apprehensive at first when I heard that the Gear-Up was going to be on voting. I was afraid that it was going to turn into a giant and heated debate. I was extremely impressed with how well everyone as a  community as a whole participated in and was respectful of everyone during the discussions.There were a lot of good points in stressing that it is not only our right but our duty to vote for the change we want to see but before we do that we must be informed on what it is we are voting.

#### (Introvert & Extrovert)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This Gear-Up overall was very helpful in understanding things about introverts I never really might have considered. I'm overall a pretty extroverted person so I've only ever seen things from the side of an extrovert (I can be an introvert in very specific cases but have never really encountered it enough to understand what it's like to be an introvert). it put a lot of things into perspective and I will keep those in mind going forward in life.

#### (Resilience)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

Resiliency was overall a very interesting topic to me. Growing up moving a bunch of times forced me to be resilient but I never really thought about how it was something that I had to learn and to practice. You never really realize how resilient you are until you are put in a situation where you have to be resilient and Turing is definitely a place where that is needed.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback given by Allison Reu Singer
"Jason, I really appreciate the leadership role you jumped into as a member of your cohort who was repeating. You helped others navigate the module and provided your cohort-mates with resources on Slack and in class, and as an SAB rep, you pushed that role even further by acting as the liaison for your cohort with the overall board. I appreciated how communicative you were and that you strove to represent your cohort's interests. As you continue with SAB next module, I want to encourage you to take on even more of a role as an agent of change -- using your leadership skills to bring about practical and positive change for the community experience of your cohort. This could look like different things depending on the situation, but whenever constructive feedback comes up from the cohort or the student body in general, I would encourage you to think about actionable steps we could take as a community to resolve that issue."

##Feedback given by Phyllis Hugunien

"Jason Conrad has been my rock at Turing.  From the beginning he has come to my aid repeatedly when I was stuck on the course-work.  He has imparted empathy as someone who has gone through the module before and knows what can tend to slow one down.  Patient, open and knowledgable he is always ready to impart what he knows or help you find the answer.  He’s also encouraged me to be a part of Turing especially on attending Friday talks (to my benefit) when I was tempted to sit one out.  He is skilled in the Socratic method of teaching and has the student reach deep for the answers. We have paired a great many times throughout the module, with an open invitation to work on the material more in depth and even use Screenhero if he is no longer on the premises.  
Jason is kind and generous, always working hard to deliver the best Turing student experience.  He takes his position as our student liaison very seriously and endeavors to present all issues fairly and accurately.  He is the embodiment of the actively engaged Turing citizen we all are striving to be."

##Feedback given by Marissa Burton

"Jason was my fellow SAB rep and was a pleasure to work with, and I look forward to working with him again next module! Jason made it his priority to represent out module at SAB meetings, balancing his own opinion with viewpoints from his fellow classmates. He was also great during Friday retros, cracking a joke and always smiling in order to create a relaxing atmosphere for our cohort to feel more comfortable expressing their opinions on sensitive matters. It was also Jason’s idea to create an exclusive Slack channel for our cohort, giving a place for our classmates to discuss non-coding related topics; this channel has caused us to all become much closer and more communicative, which I think helps with morale a lot."

### Being a Community Member

##Feedback Given to Amara Lovato

"Amara was a joy to work with. With the gap in understanding she was continually stoping to ask questions to make sure that she was understanding what it was our project was doing and what we were trying to accomplish. It was great because on more than one occasion while talking things out we would realize that it wouldn’t the way that was being anticipated so we were able to save some time. Her thirst for understanding and knowledge was amazing and was a great motivator to do the best we could throughout the project. Her flexibility to be able to come in on the weekend was also extremely helpful and appreciated. The biggest thing that I would say she needs to work on is to ask even more questions that there were times that we would get locked in doing things and then there would be a bunch of things that she didn’t fully grasp (part of that was on me getting in a grove and would just start chugging along)"

##Feedback Given to Mike Schutte

"Mike was a great partner to have. He really pushed me to have an attention to detail and really showed me how easy it can be to have solid testing if you keep it at the fore front of your mind. He was always willing to stay late when needed and put in the extra work when needed as well. I learned quite a bit from him and would be more than happy to work with him again in the future. Comparing the experience of my two final projects for Mod 1 I can say this one was far better overall and I feel like the end product shows how dedicated he was to completing this project to the best of our abilities."

##Feedback Given to Jesse Shipley

"During the “Best Kept Secret Week” Jesse and I worked on the Enigma project together. He displayed a great understanding of what it was we were trying to do and how it was that we needed to go about doing it.
Even Jesse had limited ability to stay at school he made it a point that if he was at home he was still deep into the project working things out. We both agreed to make it a point to break things down
as small as we could and to make testing a priority which was a great help to me as that was one of the things I really want to focus on. I am very happy with the end result as a project I wasn’t able to
finish the first time around mod 1 in about a week Jesse and I finished in about 2 days. I know there is no way we could’ve done it without Jesse’s dedication and work ethic. I would be more than
happy to work with Jesse again."

##Feedback Given to Marissa Burton

"I had the pleasure of working with Marissa on SAB this module. She consistently was trying to take what the people from our Module were saying and figure out ways to improve our experience. She consistently stepped up to the challenge of trying to balance being a student here while being a voice on behalf of our classmates.
She assisted in leading weekly retros in which we would try to get a sense of how our classmates were doing so that we could in turn pass it along to the staff so that we could help better the experience for the students.
She was was a great person to work with and you could see how much she wanted to represent our cohort to the best of her abilities. We were lucky to have her and I am excited to see what the rest of
her time on SAB and in this school brings!"

### Playing a Part

This time around mod 1 I strove to be more involved in the Turing Community. I attended a few meet-up events at
the beginning of the module when my schedule was more forgiving and allowed for it. I was an active participant in both Imposter Lunches and the Miyamoto Posse. I was also a member of the SAB this mod and represented my fellow classmates in those meetings as well as helped facilitate our weekly Retro. Throughout the module I also would occasionally pair with fellow students when they had questions or needed help with something. I made it a priority to be available for help when needed.
