# (Jason Conrad) - (M3) Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Going into mod 3 I was very apprehensive about what my experience was going to be like. Everyone said that it was going to be another mod 1 where it was extremely difficult you were going to be overloaded with information and you were going to be stressed all the time. While yes there was absolutely a lot of information and there was a lot of work to do, it never felt like anything was too overwhelming or too hard to grasp. I absolutely loved this mod and all the amazing things that we learned and created. Looking back on everything we were able to do in 6 weeks absolutely blows my mind. This is one of the first times I can say that I actually feel like a Software Developer. Being able to go a company and Job Shadow them was an amazing experience and was really cool to be able to look at what they were doing and understand it even just a little bit.

### Individual Projects

#### [The Count](https://github.com/jdconrad89/the-count)

For My personal project I decided I wanted to take on the process of counting calories and dieting and make it easier. Enter The Count, an application that puts the power of watching what you eat back in you hands. The Count gives you the ability to not only search for grocery items and and restaurant items, but also gives you the ability to create recipes and add ingredients to it while you track their nutritional information. 

During this project I got to explore some new concepts of functionality that I hadn't previously explored. I looked into ways to utilize my computer's camera in my program (while I was unable to get it to work in the 2 weeks I was given for this project I feel like I made some decent headway on this subject an can't wait to continue looking into it). I got to utilize AJAX which was both fun and trying. 
 

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### The Tragedy of The Commons

Overall I definitely enjoyed this Gear Up a lot more then I thought that I would going into it. I find that it's the ones that I am most apprehensive about that I end up enjoying the most. The student body never ceases to amaze me at how mature and respectful they can be when discussing topics such as these ones. The illustrations really were an interesting representation of how even a little bias can greatly affect a community if multiple people share that bias. It comes down to the theory that every person is born with two wolves inside of them, One that feeds of the good and One that feeds of the bad and which one we decide to feed is what will guide our lives.

### Gear Up
#### Automation

Going into this Gear Up I was wondering how we were going to approach the topic of automation. You usually end up with two camps, the extremely optimistic about it and the people who are very worried about it. I had no idea the level of automation we were already seeing. It makes me both hopeful and and little apprehensive for the future. Hopeful for the level of advancements we will be seeing and apprehensive for the potential effects it may have on our society.



### Gear Up
#### Basic Universal Income

This was definitely an interesting conversation to be had when you broke it down. Mostly because there were in my opinion so many unknowns and questions in regards to what a BUI would look like and the fact that it's hard to replicate the scenario under which a BUI would happen (in regards to it being the result of Automation). I feel like over all with all the different opinions and speculations there was a great conversation around the topic.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

### Feedback given to Drew Palazarri

I had the pleasure of working with Drew on Cloney Island. He was a great teammate to work with. He was always available to ask questions and was always willing to pair. He always wanted to take on new things and challenge himself and I really respected that. He had great attention to detail throughout the project.

Constructive Feedback: Over all Drew was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that sometimes there would be a gap in time between responding to his comments on a PR and when he would respond to the questions or comments.

### Feedback given to Robbie Smith

I had the pleasure of working with Robbie on Cloney Island. For this project he was the project manager. He was great to work with always making sure we were on track to finish and keeping up on who was working on what and how it was going. He took on Facebook Oauth which was a massive undertaking. He showed a tremendous work ethic throughout this project.

Constructive Feedback: Over all Robbie was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that our group as a whole would have fluctuations in our communication with each other (especially in response to comments on PR)

### Feedback given to Kyle Heppenstall

I had the pleasure of working with Kyle on Cloney Island. He was a great person to have on our team. He was always available to ask questions and was always willing to pair. He was extremely knowledgeable and I learned quite a bit from him. His attention to detail was amazing and really pushed me to be better.

Constructive Feedback: Over all Kyle was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that sometimes there was a time gap between responses on PR comments.


### Feedback given to Daniel Rodriguez

I had the pleasure of working with Daniel on Cloney Island. He was a great teammate. He  was always willing to pair. He was a great help when I ran into issues (And has been outside of this project as well). He showed a tremendous work ethic throughout this project.

Constructive Feedback: Over all Daniel was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that on a few occasions once we weren’t at school he was a little difficult to get in contact with.

### Feedback given to Ethan Bennet

I had the pleasure of working with Ethan on Rales Engine. This was the first time I got to work with Ethan and I was quite impressed with his work ethic. We stayed in Constant Communication throughout this project which was great given how much there was to do and how little of time there was to do it.

Constructive Feedback: The only thing I would say (and this is for both of us) we needed to have a little more attention to detail (we had a testing issue due to setting up SimpleCov incorrectly so our testing numbers were drastically skewed).

### Being a Community Member

### Feedback from a Robbie Smith

This was my first project with Jason. I enjoyed working with him and appreciated his flexibility and willingness to work hard. I don’t have much else to add.

### Feedback from Kyle Heppenstall

Jason, it was good working together on Cloney Island. You keep things fun and did a great job getting your tasks done and communicating with the team. My only constructive feedback is to shorten your PRs into more discrete chunks so they are easier to read and review.

### Feedback from Drew Palazarri

Feedback: Jason is an excellent teammate and coder. He was our teams rocket launcher in Cloney Island: We give him a task, fire him at the target, and forget about it because he will take care of the story. I would be happy to work with Jason again.

Constructive feedback: Sometimes Jason's pull requests are way too big and he does too many things on them. It makes reviewing his code supremely difficult. I suggest having more, smaller PR's with single responsibilities.

### Feedback from Daniel Rodriguez

I had a great time working with Jason. He’s a hard worker and he has the confidence to take on the most challenging features. I really appreciated him taking ownership of the Twilio 2 Factor Authentication and styling our splash page which ended up looking awesome thanks to him. For constructive feedback, I would encourage him to break branches into smaller pieces to make more frequent PRs. There were two that had a lot of changes across the application and it took a while for everyone to get through them.

### Feedback from Molly Brown

Jason did an amazing job contributing to every single aspect of our project. He was always willing to pair with any of us to work through issues we were having. I also appreciated his ability to find a way to make mundane tasks enjoyable - he took on the work of building a seed file for our database and ended up writing hilarious descriptions for all our items which totally added to the appeal of our site. Most of all I was impressed with his unflagging work ethic - every evening Jason continued to work on and update the rest of the group with functionality he had added to the site. I think Jason is a super versatile team member and will continue to be a real asset to any team he is a part of.

### Feedback from Ethan Bennet

Before Rales Engine, I hadn’t had the opportunity to interact much with Jason. It turned out to be a great experience, and it felt to me like we had an ideal rapport throughout the course of the project. Jason was great at communicating what he was working on, and I had complete trust in all the code he worked on. We had a pretty great moment the night before it was due when everything came together, and it happened so quickly that it shocked both of us. I think that kind of surprising progress is only possible on a team that’s functioning really well, and I’m grateful to have had the chance to build that with Jason.


## E: Posse

This Module I was a member of Turing Lab. It was really cool to see the cross between utilizing our technical skills with more hands on interaction with technology. Starting off the inning we used arduinos to write code that would make lights flash on and off which was really cool to see how we could affect the flow of electricity with the code we wrote. It was very valuable to see that our code could work with a lot more then just things on our computers.
