## Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of 3 or greater in each category of the final assessment rubric.

## Independent Work

### Expected: Independent work for M4 will consist primarily of contributing to external Open Source in Weeks 2 - 6:
#### Contributions to Code for Denver projects:
 - Reproduce and confirm or contradict one bug report:
   - [confirm issue with user project scoping](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1960877/stories/142739107)
 - Submit one sizable/difficult or two smaller/moderate code-centric pull requests that are worth merging:
   - [add dropdown functionality for preferred contact method for organizer](https://github.com/codefordenver/encorelink/pull/304)
   - [add font awesome and style changes to root](https://github.com/codefordenver/Circular/pull/70)
 - Submit one documentation patch (README, CONTRIBUTING, code documentation, etc):
   - [update README.md](https://github.com/codefordenver/Circular/pull/71)
 - Write a single blog post that explains the whole process:
   - http://mollyrachelbrown.com/2017/04/18/contributing-to-open-source.html
 
### Expected: Students, if they worked independently in Week 2, document the feedback from their instructor for their work.
#### Feedback from Ilana for Quantified Self Week 2:
 - I suggest finishing up the README's for both repos ðŸŽ‰
 - You're following RESTful routing conventions.
 - Your backend looks good overall.
 - Your ajax call look good - what happens when the data is not there? can we provide a clear error message? how would you move forward and try to accomplish the rest of the CRUD functionality?
 - You accomplished your goals. Be sure to update your code on your frontend to account for the fact that your backend is now hosted on heroku!
 - Great work @mollybrown let me know if you have questions!

## Group Work

### Expected: Students, as a pair, document the results of their project from Week 1.
#### Feedback from Casey for Quantified Self Week 1:
 - Specification Adherence: 3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect
 - Testing: 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type
 - HTML/UI: 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
 - JS syntax and Style: 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
 - Git Workflow: 3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
 - Project Management: 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's work. Team is 
- Risk Taking: N/A

### Expected: Students, as a project team, are responsible for delivering all scheduled feature cards in the primary project by the end of Sprint 3 (Week 5).

## Feedback & Community

For my community contribution to Turing this module, I decided to co-lead the Gear-Up on Week 5 along with Drew P. As a whole, I think having mod 4 students take some responsibility over the Gear Ups and implement some of the changes that they would like to see in the curriculum is a great idea. Additionally, I think the topic of Automation is both interesting to talk about AND important, so it was great to be able to dig into it a bit deeper. During the actual gear-up session, I was reminded about how much I dislike standing at the front of the room and talking and was grateful for everyone in the room participating and paying attention. I really liked the smaller group sizes (I think we ended up with 3 groups of 3), and it seemed like a a perfect size for everyone to participate equally from what I observed during the discussion segment. The only thing I would change was leaving more room for whole-group discussion in the end. Overall it was a valuable experience that I hope Turing will keep up.
