# Molly Brown - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Mod 2 was a great experience and much a different challenge than Mod 1. Creating our first Rails apps and seeing our projects online was totally gratifying. I experienced probably the first group project that I have ever enjoying participating in with Bike Share, which was a very welcome surprise. I sent my first tweet (topic: how to screw up your Jekyll partials using capital letters)! I managed to finally complete the [Front-End Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) that I started nearly a year ago and learned a ton of things that should serve me well in Mods 3 and 4. I successfully stalked people on LinkedIn and GitHub and sent cold emails despite the fact it made me totally uncomfortable and have multiple meetings setup with my contacts in the coming weeks. Overall the mod was a ton of work and forced me out of my comfort zone in multiple ways but also increased my confidence as both professionally and as a Turing student.

## B: Individual & Group Work
### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://serene-beyond-86450.herokuapp.com/)
**1. Functional Expectations**
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

**2. ActiveRecord**
* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

**3. User Experience and Conventions**
* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

**4. Code Organization/Quality**
* 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

**5. Testing**
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

**6. Working Collaboratively**
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### [Little Shop](https://serene-beyond-86450.herokuapp.com/)

Little Shop was another enjoyable group work experience. I felt like our group was well-balanced and while we all tended to specialize in certain aspects of the site, we all made contributions to each aspect of the site, which I think is the ideal group dynamic. It seemed that we were able to work through issues as pairs and as a collective efficiently, and in the end we had a finished product that we alll were proud of. 

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://safe-beach-21416.herokuapp.com/)

I really enjoyed working on Job Tracker. I was proud of the sheer amount of work I accomplished in a short time frame and liked the fact that I could continue to build on the project and make it better. I ended up adding authentication in place of starting a new project for the rails mini project and would really like to make some tweaks so that I can use it in place of Trello for actually tracking the jobs I am interested in. I also acknowledge that my routing patterns and controllers still need to be refactored if I am going to make it into a portfolio piece.

## C: Professional Skills
### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions
I participated in the "Responding to Microaggressions" sub-group for this gear-up. For better or worse, while my conversations about this topic were pretty uninspired during the gear-up itself, I went on to have multiple excellent and thoughtful conversations about the material with other people from my mod in the subsequent weeks. We discussed how it has difficult to find a balance between calling people out on their micro-agressive actions while being not so aggressive in response that it puts people on the defensive, as well as distinguishing the difference between a "real" microaggression and a well-intentioned mistake. Ultimately our conversations seemed to resolve to the importance of exercising discrimination in not deliberately seeking reasons to feel offended but also calling out poor behavior when it occurs.

#### Journey Mapping
The Journey Mapping was a neat concept, though I'm still not sure how it differs from the idea of creating a user story. Our group covered the process of the emotional up-and-downs of the improv session in Mod 1 and the process of getting a new driver's license at the DMV. I think the biggest take away for me was the importance of empathy towards users in designing services, and how much many of our government services could stand to be improved in the regard.

#### Grit Mindset
To quote one of my group discussion members, grit is resilience with an aspirational (passion) focus rather than an oppositional one. Again, I think it is useful to have the concept of grit to be able to have conversations about those character traits and motivations that allow us to overcome difficulties in life and grow, but so much of the material out there seems to have the capacity to victimize or inspire in equal parts. Personally, I feel as if it is was only through a period of _not_ striving/fighting/grasping for direction or passion that allowed me the space to come up with a definition of success that resonated with me personally and chart another course. I would so much rather see children being taught that it is ok and natural to feel lost or confused or not know what makes you tick than adding "passion" as yet another prerequisite that one needs to check off in order to live a meaningful life.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication
I volunteered to play PM for our bike share group as I had worked in an agile environment before and felt comfortable with the idea of creating user stories and cards to track progress on our project. In general I felt that the whole project went smoothly and thankfully my teammates were receptive to my attempts at keeping all of us on track. I think the best process we implemented was having a short retrospective at the beginning and end of each working session to make sure that we were all on the same page. Alternatively, I could have done a better job of using pomodoros to make sure that we did not work too long without taking a break and being more aggressive about prompting us to move on from certain issues.

The main constructive feedback I received from team members was, as I mentioned above, to not be shy about really owning my role as PM and making it clear to the group that we could not afford to spend any further time on a given issue. While I did some cajoling to move us in the right direction, I also held back in not wanting to interrupt the focus of the group and fear appearing to nag or be overbearing. In the end, I learned that my teammates were open to and even expected more "hearding" than I gave in the end. This prompted to me to consider that I should act more self-confidently in owning the roles I take on in projects and trust my team to tell me if I do something that they disagree with, rather than holding back.

#### Feedback II
Through the Johari Window activity I learned that I had a ton of adjectives that fell into my blind spot that pointed to traits I am reluctant to identify in myself (i.e kind, organized, etc). Unsurprisingly, I also learned that being a part of different group dynamics can totally influence other's perception of you and your relative strengths and weaknesses. Not that I could prove anything, but I thought I had a decent idea of what feedback came from which project partners. Since the adjective sheet contained very few words that could lend themselves to constructive feedback (in my opinion), I can't say this project gave me any ideas of how to improve. My main takeaway in the end was to give myself a bit more credit for my "good" qualities.

## D: Feedback
### Giving Feedback

*To Caroline Powell (Bike Share)*: Caroline, it was awesome working with you on the Bike Share project and I felt spoiled by having you on our team. You took the lead in working through the nuances of creating our database architecture and brought up issues and potential solutions that would have never occurred to me. You are also impressively tenacious about working through problems and researching solutions and testing them for effectiveness. My only suggestion for improvement would to be remain mindful of your ability to dig deeply into issues and stick to a time limit so that you do not end up dwelling on one particular issue for too long. Still, I was very impressed by your ability to consider each issue from many potential angles. Thanks for all your hard work and I hope I get the chance to work on a project with you again.

*To Ethan Bennett (Bike Share)*: Ethan, I felt like you were the most versatile member of our team and did an awesome job of offering help on every aspect of our project. I was particular impressed by your ability to jump into the visual design and structure of our website and put together a finished product that showcased our data very well in a short time frame. It was a huge confidence boost for me personally to know that we had a good-looking first project to showcase right from the start of Mod 2. My one suggestion for improvement would be to keep the lines of communication open with team members when working remotely. Again, thanks for all your work and being the swiss army knife of our team!

*To Mike Schutte (Bike Share)*: Mike, I am equally grateful for both the positive attitude and energy your contributed to our team as well as your carefully thought-out code. In particular I was really impressed by your work to keep up team morale as we worked late the night before the project was due and your ability to pitch in and help any of us work through code issues, despite the fact that were were all working on very different aspects of the project - it speaks highly of your skills with the concepts we have learned thus far. That being said, in future projects I would suggest that you remain mindful of the fact that your fluency with the material and desire to write the best code possible can sometimes conflict with the needs of your other team members to work through issues at their own speed. However, you also demonstrated that you are open and responsive to constructive feedback and make immediate changes as needed, which I have the utmost respect for. Thank you again for all you contributed and helping make our project and team finish strong.

*To Marisa Burton (Little Shop)*: Marisa was a super versatile member of our team. She helped get authorization up and running on our site, contributed to the styling and layout, and contributed an impressive number of tests to our test suite. I really appreciated the fact that she asked lots of questions when she was unclear on things as it prompted me to stop and think about the same. I also apprciated her willingness to jump in and offer help to everyone on the team with whatever they were working on at the current moment. Above all I resepected her efforts to push herself outside of her comfort zone and gain exposure to working on every aspect of our site, which is probably the most important habit for a developer to have.

*To Jason Conrad (Little Shop)*: Jason did an amazing job contributing to every single aspect of our project. He was always willing to pair with any of us to work through issues we were having. I also appreciated his ability to find a way to make mundane tasks enjoyable - he took on the work of building a seed file for our database and ended up writing hilarious decriptions for all our items which totally added to the appeal of our site. Most of all I was impressed with his unflagging work ethic - every evening Jason continued to work on and update the rest of the group with functionality he had added to the site. I think Jason is a super versatile team member and will continue to be a real asset to any team he is a part of.

*To Eric Walgren-Sauro (Little Shop)*: First and foremost I was impressed by Eric's attention to detail on our project. He noticed many areas for improvement and took the initiative in solving issues. I was also impressed by his tenacity in working through difficult problems and patience to try out many different solutions until he found the one that worked. Finally, I feel that we all benefitted greatly from his willingness to jump into every aspect of the project and pair with people to work through issues. I think the polish and cohesivness of our final project can be atributed in large part to Eric's hard work. 

### Being a Community Member

*From Caroline Powell*: I had the pleasure of working with Molly on the Bike Share project. We chose Molly to be our project manager and she did a great job keeping us organized and on track. In addition to being a great project manager, Molly was a real team asset on analytics methods and bonus extensions. One of Molly’s greatest strengths is that she is not afraid to go above and beyond and tackle new things with little guidance. She took the lead in figuring out the google maps API, and as a result we had a stunning index page that displayed the locations of each bike station in San Francisco. The map was a real wow factor that gave our site immediate visual appeal on a project very early on in our program at Turing.

*From Mike Schutte*: Molly, thank you for all your work as project manager. You did a fantastic job keeping us on track and productive. Additionally, I really respect how you were undaunted in figuring out the Google Map API, it really took our project to another level. On your next projects, I recommend making an effort to improve your attention to detail on factors such as changes in variable names in order to skip small and preventable bugs. Thanks again for being a great teammate, and good luck on your future projects.

*From Ethan Bennett*: Molly: You did a great job managing our team. It was impressive that your response to our inactive Waffle board was to make an executive decision and try a different format (the Google doc), and I think the second try “clicked” (“cluck?") more with our group. It felt especially helpful towards the end, as we were crossing things off and finishing up. Since you want to be a project manager in the future, it might be worth thinking about how you’d respond to a situation that called for a stronger arbitration of work, refereeing group squabbles, etc, but it’s awesome that none of that was necessary in this project.

*From Marisa Burton*: Molly was a pleasure to work with in Little Shop. She did an amazing job coding a large portion of the front-end, and is extremely focused and hard-working. She always volunteered to take on the difficult tasks of the project and was an active team member helping us debug and work through some of the problems we encountered. She was a valuable member of our team and we couldn’t have finished the project without her.

*From Eric Walgren-Sauro*: I'll keep this concise because Molly would want that. Molly's diligence was the glue of our little-shop team. Whenever we'd be off task as a collective, she'd be quick to bring our attention back to the demands of the project. I appreciated her ability to stay focused. She also was able to make meaningful progress, working independently.

*From Jason Conrad*: I had the privelege of working with Molly on the Little Shop project. From the start she showed her willingness to take something on, as the first day she started the basic design setup of the website so that we could design it as we implemented functionality. She was always willing to help out if someone was running into an issue and was also helping us keep focus in the moments where our resolve was starting to fade. She also made sure that she had worked on both functionality and styling to get as much as she could out of this project. I would defintiely work with Molly again!

## E: Community Participation

The highlight of my community participation at Turing this mod was joining the new maker posse. I had been interested in small hardware projects for a long time (esp. arduinos) and having the oppurtunity to play with them at Turing was totally fufilling. I volunteered to take on the work of creating an inventory of all the parts/resources this group makes available and creating a guide detailing what sorts of projects you can do with certain parts to get newcomers to the group started. In my cold outreach process I made many connections with Turing alums, which (hopefully) helps make the Turing network stronger. While I was not able to devote time to formal paring this mod, I did take the time to make connections with several mod 1 students and offer support and perspective. Next mod I am looking forward to having more time to formally pair with students and acting as a prework guide for incoming students.
