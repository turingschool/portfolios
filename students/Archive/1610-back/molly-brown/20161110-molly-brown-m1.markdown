# Molly Brown - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this first module was to soak in as much information as I could and get as much practice in as possible so as to have a solid and confident foundation in Ruby going forward into future modules. My secondary goal was to balance this ambition with realistic expectations of myself so as to avoid burnout and enable me to hold on to the excitement for learning throughout the course of the program.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Generally speaking I am more comfortable working alone on projects, though I knew coming into Turing that this was a mindset that would likely not serve me very well in this environment and needed to change. As predicted, after much time wasted going in circles in my first solo project, it was abundantly clear that the road to success at Turing is in large part dependent on one's ability to ask for outside help and guidance while writing code. While I still enjoy getting lost in my head, I am much more disciplined about seeking help when I need it and comfortable with sharing my work, no matter how imperfect I judge it to be. Given that this is something I have struggled with my entire life, I consider this mindset shift a large win!

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollybrown/mastermind_final)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Mastermind is a simple pattern guessing name built with a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print Loop) interface. For each new game, the program generates a random 4-letter combination made up of the letters (Y)ellow, (G)reen, (B)lue, and (R)ed

###### Evaluation Comments

* No effective testing
* Project was done in 3 nights, pretty good progress.
* there is the start of some organization
* think about how to start pulling methods out to their own objects, organize things by function or theme

###### Evaluation Scores

Test-Driven Development: 1 - Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 2 - Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay

Breaking Logic into Components: 2 - Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3 - Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

Enumerable & Collections: 3 - Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

As I alluded to above, prior to Turing group work was not something I had much experience with or eagerly sought out based on past experiences. I am happy to report that Turing has more or less cured me of that hangup. Both my group project experiences were tremendous learning opportunities in terms of programming and how to effectively communicate. I find myself looking forward to the opportunities to do pair and group work in the future.   

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollybrown/Night-Writer-Project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

Night Writer is a program used to convert text (.txt) files in english, convert them to pseudo-braille, and output the braille to a new text file. It also takes braille files and converts them back to english text.

###### Evaluation Comments

* Tests written but fail on execution all except the translator text
* Special characters completed
* Try not to have methods that simply modify an instance variable
* Does translate have any state? What should get stored in state
* there's a lot of instance variables that are unnecessary

###### Evaluation Scores

Test-Driven Development: 2 - Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

Breaking Logic into Components: 2 - Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2 - Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

Overall Functionality: 2 - Application converts to Braille and back successfully

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

The Black Thursday project walked us through building a "Business Intelligence Suite" to "extract" and "synergize" "customer insights" while "leveraging complex data structures". In other words, we created a ruby program to create relationships between sellers and customers using real Etsy data, as well as basic statistical analysis tools to characterize that data.

###### Evaluation Comments

* Tests ran at .89 seconds,
* 181 runs, 402 assertions
* really good organization of tests
* used module for analytics
* Some minor areas that could be refactored and logic pushed around

###### Evaluation Scores

Functional Expectations: 3 - Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

Test-Driven Development: 4 - Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4 - Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4 - Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

Enumerable & Collections: 3 - Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

Code Sanitation: 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

While it might be easy to diminish the importance of the topics addressed under this category in contrast to the programming work, I consistently found the discussions I had surrounding the Gear Ups to be both satisfying and valuable, as well as indicative of the awesomeness of my fellow students. The information presented as part of the professional development workshops was similarly valuable and I appreciated the thought that went into creating the resources presented.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

While perhaps overly meta, my main takeaway was that I was impressed by how careful and measured our group was to keep the discussion away from descending into personal opinions on the current election cycle... this was great as no one ended up singled out/alienated. As a group we agreed that we were most impressed by leaders who are able to clearly articulate their positions and lay out pragmatic plan of action for addressing issues. I also got some great suggestions on sources for finding analysis on local ballot issues beyond the big blue book they send out in the fall.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

As someone who leans heavily towards the introverted side of the spectrum, I found it interesting in our group discussion that even the people who considered themselves more extroverted said that they were introverts in other contexts, and vice versa for those who identified as introverts. This made me wonder if we were actually talking about "true" introversion vs. extroversion. Personally, I define introversion as the feeling of needing to go hide in a dark, quiet room to recover from socializing, even if you are enjoying the situation you are in and are comfortable. I definitely struggle with feeling exhausted by the constant group interaction at Turing, but have learned that frequent breaks to walk around downtown by myself go a long way to helping me recharge.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

As someone who fundamentally views their decision to attend Turing as itself act of resilience, I was simultaneously very happy to see the topic brought up as well as uncomfortable. I say "uncomfortable" not to the detriment of the people in my group (who were all totally engaged and respectful), but because it feels almost dishonest to me to talk about resilience on a shallow level, yet I also know that amongst a group of relative strangers, the shallow discussion is the expected and appropriate one to have. The discussion solidified for me the the huge importance of this topic for me personally as well as my desire to find way to communicate with others on the topic in an honest but not overly challenging way. It also inspired me to maybe give a bit more benefit of the doubt to people in the future, based on the very intelligent discussion I as lucky to share with my group members.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part 1

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Deliverable: Working Resume link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gimly20kufjwi9d/Brown_Resume_2016.pdf?dl=0)
* [Deliverable: LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mollyrachelbrown)
* [Deliverable: Github profile](https://github.com/mollybrown)
* [Deliverable: Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mol_brown)

I was happy to see that this topic was brought up in just our second day at Turing and that the material covered in the workshop was both useful and substantial. Luckily my LinkedIn was in pretty decent shape and was already aligned for the most part with the principles and advice that was outlined, though I found I could not yet commit to simply listing my title as "Software Developer". I ended up doing some minor reorganization to my resume, adding a bit more information to my Github account, and setting up a Twitter account as well. I'm excited to continue the personal branding process by overhauling my existing personal website and working to finally create a cohesive aesthetic and message for all my social accounts.

### Learning to Pair
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [DTR Memo](https://gist.github.com/mollybrown/ee460f3087543a43e7c2e61d5c5dca89)

Paring was a somewhat scary concept for me in the beginning, so I really appreciated the seriousness with which this subject was treated. As a result I felt comfortable navigating the DTR process with my project partners (and even in shorter pairings). The DTR framework is something I will definitely take with me into future jobs and projects.

### Feedback Part 1
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

Similar to above, this was a slightly scary but very important workshop to hold. Obviously we all need honest, constructive feedback to grow both as people and as developers. I really like that by emphasizing the importance both the DTR and feedback-elicitation process, Turing is actively training a very growth-oriented community.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Kyle Heppenstall: Kyle was a fantastic partner. His skill as a teacher shone through in particular, and I feel that learned an exceptional amount simply from observing how he approached problems - my Ruby game definitely leveled up from working with him. My only piece of constructive feedback to offer would be to not get too swept up in the hype/stress surrounding the project and dial back the intensity of the work in the beginning as we are laying the conceptual foundations. As a partner who was behind him in my programming skill level, the pace was intimidating at times. That being said, once I was confident that I fully grasped the structure of the program, working with him felt very focused but relaxed, which is the sweet spot I think we all aspire to hit in our work! In the end, I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to pair with him on this project.

Alex Fosco: As my first partner for a pair project I really appreciated both your support and patience. You regularly prompted me to slow down and clearly organize and articulate my ideas, and worked to keep us focused on the TDD process. In terms of constructive feedback, I would encourage you to be more aggressive about speaking up and asking for clarification when you are not following what your partner is proposing. Overall I really enjoyed working with you and navigating the process of learning how to pair!

### Being a Community Member

From Kyle Heppenstall (Black Thursday): My positive feedback for Molly is that she does a great job asking questions and slowing the team down when needed. She has a great attention to detail that helped us build code that was as versatile and stylish as possible without spending too much time refactoring after the fact. My other piece of positive feedback is that Molly took more ownership of the project as it progressed. My constructive feedback is to understand the scope of the project more thoroughly from the beginning to help drive the team more. Overall Molly was very fun to work with and did a good job keeping the mood light but focused.

From Alex Fosco (Night Writer) (Paraphrasing from group retro): You did a good job identifying problems that needed to be worked on to complete the project. Communication could have been improved both in terms of goal setting for individual work and frequency/benchmarks, i.e. setting regular check-in times when working solo. I sometimes did not understand why you were making certain choices with the code your wrote, so making it habit to sit down with your partner and review the code changes you make when working alone would be helpful for future work.


### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community in many small ways this module. I attempted to help answer questions and provide guidance to other students in our cohort when possible. I was a present and active participant during group work in-class as well as outside of class (i.e. Lunch Roulettes, Gear-Ups, etc.) I took advantage of paring opportunities offered by mod 2 students and reached out to other more advanced students for guidance and advice (and greatly appreciated their efforts to check in with me along the way!)

I also had a lot of fun scheming with a sub-group in our cohort about the possibility of starting a new posse and lesson plans/side projects we would like to take on in the future. As of now I have committed to creating a tutorial to guide a web scraping project that I started working on this past summer. I'd like to test-drive this tutorial with the small group next mod to begin, then offer it up to the larger community if it is well-received.

I'm really looking forward to branching out into Meetups and more professional development related opportunities next mod, as well as offering paring sessions to newer students.
