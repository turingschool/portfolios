# Molly Brown - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals when beginning this module were: 1) to broaden my horizons is learning how to build and consume APIs, 2) to continue to push my boundaries and perservere through fatigue, 3) to build a kick-ass personal project that I could be proud of.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
#### Weekend Warrior

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollybrown/weekend-warrior)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

The goal of this project was to create a successful web application from a project idea, with the included functionality of authenticating with a third-party service and consuming an api.

Unfortunately, this project was unsuccessful for me, which I attribute to a combination of poor planning, competing priorities, and burnout. In my opinion, the points of failure and areas I need to address in order to be successful in future projects are as follows:

**Points of Failure / Areas for Improvement**
- Wishful thinking in that 1st choice of API would have issues resolved sooner than later -> putting off work
- Fatigue from previous group project spilling over into week
- Stress/Anxiety over assessment -> Investing time in practicing for assessment at the expense of personal project planning
- Over-hyped importance of personal project in my own head, leading to inability to make decision on what to do and lack of excitement after committing to a project
- General Burnout -> Procrastination. Did not make significant progress on project until Sun.
- User stories lacking sufficient details because I didn’t have a clear idea of what I actually wanted the application to do/what functionality I wanted it to have.
- Unanticipated complexity from using different API… ended up patching extra tables and associations onto project to handle it.
- Did not TDD well at all. Plowed ahead with building DB and adding associations without testing that they made sense first. This was biggest bottleneck as I could not move forward without these working and discovered in attempting to set up tests that they were not working. Trying to “untangle” the mess seemed impossible.
- Lack of understanding on how to structure milestones. How do I break the problem into smaller chunks that are digestible and deliver value that can be built upon?

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

The first thing I was struck by when reading about UBI was how foreign the need for it seems to me. It’s not that I am unfamiliar with the concept, but being someone who has spent their entire life in upper-middle class areas (Boulder, San Diego) with middle to upper-middle class peers, it’s easy for me to remain totally ignorant of the impact of automation on a huge number of America’s workers and communities. I caught myself being surprised that I never thought of the self-checkout stations at the grocery store as indicative of someone’s job being automated (rather than just a convenience), even though it so clearly is. My other thought was that I very surprised to hear that UBI has as much support as it does when welfare is such a looked-down upon idea in so much of American society. It seems that as long as we are able to blame people’s need for help on “robots” things are ok, while many many other things that are equally out of an individual’s control and would lead to that person seeking welfare assistance are painted as a personal failing and underserving of help. My thought its that as the automation wave continues and more and more people end up out of work and impoverished as a result, there will be a serious collective unpacking of our thought on state-sponsored assistance.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

As of today, I am very much in the middle in terms of my attitudes on automation. On one hand, I feel that automation has not had a very visible impact on my life. On the other hand, I'm sure that in thinking that automation has not had an impact on my life then I am painting myself as someone who is currently living in privledged ignorance about the issue. Personally, I have a very difficult time taking anything Elon Musk says about the subject with more than a grain of salt since he is currently on the leading edge of bringing automation technologies into an undeniably public view. I really enjoyed one of the interviews we watched in class where someone said something along the lines of Silicon Valley being delusional about thinking that every new product and technology they create is going to make the world a better place.  I think having the courage to challenge that line of thinking is at least one small thing I can do as I enter the tech world.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really enjoyed the PotP lesson and thought that it illustrates “-isms” in a very non-confrontational and data driven matter. My main take away was that bias and the negative fallout from it stems in large part from simply the very human act of gravitating towards others who are similar to us (age, gender, race, etc.). To counteract it, however, we have to make a conscious decisions on a daily basis to actively seek out unfamiliar faces and ideas and places that we are not totally comfortable it. Knowing that very few people have the resolve to do this, we then have things like diversity quotas to force people to interact with a more diverse population, which I support 100%. Too many people misapply some sort of meritocracy to who gets what jobs - quotas address the actual reality of the situation.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Lucy Conklin:** From my experience working with Lucy on our Cloney Island project, I would confidently say that she was the most versatile member of our group. I was lucky to have the experience of paring with her on both front-end and back-end issues and in both instances came away with a much better understanding of the issue at hand. In particular, Lucy blew my mind with the command of css and sass she demonstrated in our project - I’m pretty sure it would have taken me a month to come up with the organizational structure that she built in a matter of days. She was also a consummate hostess and kindly offered her house as a meeting spot for us to work together over the weekend which was both a ton of fun and allowed us to get some solid work done. I’m stoked I got to share the Girl Group experience along with Lucy and learned a ton from her in the process.

**Amy Kintner:** In working on our Cloney Island project, Amy proved to be the perfect partner in hacking through difficult issues. We spent many hours together working together on setting up the authorization and authentication system for our site in what could have been a very frustrating process were it not for Amy’s levelheadedness, flexibility, and persistence. She also continued to be the point person for our Google Oauth issues as they continued to pop-up and totally impressed me with her endurance on attacking the issues. Finally, I very much appreciated Amy’s humor and ability to compel us towards some much needed breaks and fun after we had all been deep in the weeds for too long. She was a key contributor in making Girl Group awesome and I’m so happy that I was able to share the experience with her and all the other girls in our group.

**Caroline Powell:** Bluntly put, Caroline kicked ass on our Cloney Island project. Not only did she do an amazing job planning out our database (as one would expect from her), but she also played the part of a super competent Project Manager. She (along with her co-PM Annie) did an excellent job breaking down our gigantic project into clear and achievable components that allowed us all to work together very effectively. She also did an excellent job bringing us together for check-ins as well. The combination of Caroline taking a lead on our app architecture and on our project definitely helped me (and I would argue all of us) do our best work.

### Being a Community Member

**From Amy Kintner:** I had the pleasure of working with Molly on our Cloney Island project, during which we – the ladies – cloned Pinterest. Molly and I collaborated on the process of getting Google Oauth set up, which proved a rather more daunting task than either of us realized at first, and she also volunteered to be our Twilio ninja. In the latter role, Molly was really the only person to have her hands on Twilio, on which she worked tirelessly and valiantly for the better part of a week. Between Google Oauth, Twilio, and the work she did styling on the Wednesday before the project was due, I think Molly gets the award for bravest and most fearless amongst our group.

As with the others in the group, however, Molly was a delight to work with because she never took any of the work or any of our roles too seriously. We laughed a lot, and we got a lot done. It was by far the most fun I’ve yet had at Turing and was an experience I expect to go unmatched in my time yet to come.

**From Caroline Powell:** The Pinspiration project was my second time working with Molly, and my feedback is similar to the first time we worked together. Molly always chooses to take on the tasks that nobody knows how to do yet. Other people are afraid to take on the new tasks that they’re not sure they can execute, but Molly is not afraid and ends up figuring it out every single time. In this project, Molly stepped up and took on the password reset user story that involved sending a text message with a confirmation pin to the user’s phone. Since we needed to hardroll some of the functionality, most of the documentation available on the subject didn’t pertain to us and wasn’t much help. She was able to figure it out anyway. I think this is a quality that any employer should take notice of. Molly is good at solving problems without answers and instruction, and this is the environment we’ll be operating in on the job. Molly can solve problems that not many people have solved before.

**From Annie Wolff:** Molly might just have the honor of being my favorite person at Turing. Besides being a dedicated worker who will tackle projects singlehandedly and deliver amazing work, she's also very supportive and fun to be around. I truly appreciated her work on our Cloney Island project and I really respect her evenhanded approach to discussions and group work.

### Playing a Part

My main contribution to Turing this mod came in the form of being an engaged student. While I was not able to invest as much time in pairing or contributing to Posse goals as I would have liked to this mod due to workload, I was actively engaged in our collective attempts to shape our demands for the mod 4 curriculum. I also gave no less than two high-quality emergency pep-talks to fellow students in need, and may or may have not convinced another person to come to Turing as a student.
