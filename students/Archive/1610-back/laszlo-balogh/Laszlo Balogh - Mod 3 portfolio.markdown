# Laszlo Balogh - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Build up a solid understanding of how APIs work, both ways: consuming an API and serving API responses. I wanted to finally build an app I have been thinking about for a while as my final, personal project now that I will know all the key concepts on the backend side to bring it to life.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual effort

#### Planout Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/planoutproject)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

Planout Project helps to solve the problem of how to efficiently plan outdoor activities such as Running. Not only to manage time and arrange events into lists, but also helping the end users making a decision when to sign up and for what events in order to minimize the overall cost. By using this tools, users are expected to save various amounts, depending on the nature of the events as well as many the users will sign up for.
The implementation is based on Ruby On Rails, but heavy use of various JQUERY libraries on the frontend side. AJAX communicatoin between the frontend and backend to enhance end user experience.

#### API curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

The goal was to recreate certain functionalities of a well known site to learn various feature implemetation concepts through consuming the API of said servicek. FOr user authentication, we had to use OAuth.
The API documentation was very unclear, most of the site features were also not well defined, so we were left for intensive research.
We used a gem to handle low level Oauth related handshaking.

The project was NOT graded.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

One paired project (2 people including me) and one group project (3 people including me)

#### RailsEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/RailsEngine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

The API had predefined endpoints that we had to build. Except "Boss Mode", all API endpoints were successfully implemented and tested. We built an extensive test coverage, to ensure robust test of all endpoints as well as strong unit testing of all components (models).
The sales data was loaded into various database tables from multiple `.CSV` files. We had to build various controllers that we structured to be able to support each endpoint through RESTful routes. We used namespacing as needed to meet the expected endpoint definitions.

#### Evaluation

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

#### Cloney Island - Box Drop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ethanbennett/drop-it-like-its-hot)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

Implementing a clone of one of the well known and popular online services. We picked the popular file repository solution Drop Box, to build a site that would match the basic functionality of the popular site.
We ran a Ruby On Rails rendering user interface that allowed the end user to upload to and download from an AWS S3 bucket various files through their browser.
The uploaded content could be organized into various folders through the browser interface.

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income (UBI)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

Reflection:
I think UBI on paper seems like a great idea, but I have two major concerns I think need to be addressed in order to have any chance for it to be successful:
1. Risk at government/economic level: we need to make sure that monthly cost of living relative to the UBI will not change, so the relative purchasing power of the UBI will remain.
2. Risk at personal level: most people need to make different personal choices. The general picture is that most people are caught up in consumerism and compulsory consumption. Having UBI would mean they would spend more per month, but still most likely not have a happier life. In other words: I expect most people to just spend that extra money on stuff, instead of maybe reducing work time  and use that money to allow more personal freedom, get different experiences, etc. A documentary about compulsory consumption: http://minimalismfilm.com/. TED talk on the same subject: https://youtu.be/GgBpyNsS-jU 

#### Tragedy Of The Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Reflection:
Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
Based on setting the slider on the simulation page (http://ncase.me/polygons/) to “I’ll move if less than 32%  of my neighbors are like me” shows zero movement…

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Amy Kintner after RailsEngine project:
It has been a great pleasure to pair with Amy on the RailsEngine project. Our work style and schedule complimented well each other and I feel we could have a very efficient workflow.
I very much appreciated Amy’s dedication to push forward. She is definitely a coding pioneer in a sense that she is not afraid to go ahead and tackle the complex tasks for initial completion to allow the team to maximize the time for refactoring.
Amy is also very strong on building documentation. Relying on her academic background she could build a very strong product documentation that anyone can follow easily.

To Ethan Bennett after Cloney Island project:
I was fortunate to work with Ethan on our Cloney Island project: first time working together. Ethan has a very calm manner and has the capability to easily integrate into any team.
He is ready to share his opinion backed by facts, so one should always listen when he suggests a solution as there are a well thought through reasoning behind that goes along with already experimenting with the solution himself.
Coming prepared with his own suggestion, yet Ethan is always open to listen to other suggestions, evaluate other suggestions, adjust if needed based on the team decision and fully support the team decision going forward.

To David Knott after Cloney Island project:
This has been my second time to work on a project with David. I think our feedback to each other from our Black Thursday project was helpful as from a Git flow point of view our work has been that much smoother and more efficient.
David is still a very hard worker. He gives 110% and always comes back with initial implementations of the complex issues, such as Two-Factor authentication or Google OAuth. He seems to enjoy very much being in the lead to crack the complex tasks. With the right team structure, David would be thriving without any doubt.

### Being a Community Member

From Amy Kintner after RailsEngine project:
It was a pleasure to finally get to work with Laszlo on an official project, RailsEngine in our first week of Mod 3. The biggest thing I noticed right away was that our methods of communication and our work schedules complimented each other perfectly, which made us an ideal match for such a labor-intensive project. Laszlo’s focus on testing is perhaps unmatched in our cohort, and that helped to keep the project’s progress grounded. His dedication to code-review in pull requests on GitHub also helped prevent at least one major issue, and thus kept the project from suffering any hiccups. In the end, we managed to make it through the week without any major problems, a fact that I attribute to Laszlo’s commitment to testing and careful review of PRs.

From Ethan Bennett after Cloney Island project:
This was my first opportunity to work with Laszlo. His intelligence and his calm demeanor are both extremely valuable assets to have on a team, and they translated to strong leadership in our AWS struggles. Laszlo was also the first of us to realize the gravity of our workflow issues, and I wonder if we would have had nearly the same amount of completed work if not for him emerging as a leader in the group. We all share the blame for our weak workflow and lack of organization, but that’s the only obvious criticism I see. In fact, Laszlo was advocating for a merge before anyone else. As a whole, I think the project was a great learning experience, and I really enjoyed sharing it with Laszlo.

From David Knott after Cloney Island project:
I enjoyed working with you a second time and I think we both learned a lot (about a lot more than just technical skills).  After the retro at the end of our project we talked about when, why, and how our group organization went a bit off course.  I was very impressed by both how you handled us being down a member as well as by your willingness to provide feedback and support for Eric before he decided it was best to leave.  That took some serous awareness and empathy, both valuable skills in all aspects of like.  Going forward I’m excited to see what you do (in mod 4 and in the future) and where you go because you my friend can go anywhere.
