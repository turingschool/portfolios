# Laszlo Balogh - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

I feel that I grew significantly as a programmer. The progress I have made in the past six weeks is tremendous. I have learnt a ton not only from Casey and Sal (who both did a superb job), but also from everybody in our cohort. I have full confidence when I need to start on a new web application that I will be able to build it. I feel I was also able to improve my skills in testing and refactoring our code, although writing efficient code is still a skill I will have to continue working in Mod3 as well.
My growing experience as a developer as well as the new skills and tool I learnt throughout this module helped me to start a side project: building a controller application for configuring high precision equipment that will be used to drive high performance laser applications in laboratory environment.

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Little Shop - Lobbify](http://lobbify.herokuapp.com/)
Not graded. Self reflection:
This project finally brought for me the breakthrough of getting into a solid Git workflow. Frequent commits, detailed commit messages, detailed Pull Request reviews, line by line commentary on Pull Requests. The overall teamwork has been excellent: very open communication, great collaboration.

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bike-share)
1. Functional Expectations  
3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord  
3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions  
4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

4. Code Organization/Quality  
3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

6. Working Collaboratively  
4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://floating-journey-48927.herokuapp.com/)

1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations  
4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

2. Routes  
4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

3. Controllers  
3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

4. ActiveRecord  
3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

5. Views  
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

6. User Experience  
4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

7. Testing  
4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

#### [Mix Master](https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/mix-master)

Project was not graded. Self reflection:  
I decided to use the name of artists instead of their database id. That helped me to get familiar with paths and get a first feel of how to use them when a more user friendly/humanly readable implementation is needed and its challenges: such as making sure names are unique within the database.  
Also this project was the very first usable Rails app we implemented. This was an eye opener recognizing the progress I have  made as a web application developer through 8 weeks at Turing. :-)

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Grit  
Reflection based on questions from the gear up session:  
1. You have something you find enduringly fascinating  
At this point with the basic concepts pretty well understood, I still find it fascinating, how we can build something that works, then refactor it, so it still provides the same functionality, but by running a much more simplified code.  
2. You view frustrations as a necessary part of the process  
When I feel frustrated, I rather view it as a clear sign from my own body that it is definitely time to take a break and do something else. Despite that my mind keep telling me that I should not leave until an issue is resolved, any time I listened to my body in this situation and returned to the same issue (source of frustration) later on, I could resolve that quicker and better.  
3. You look for ways to make your work more meaningful  
Whenever we learn something new, I always think about ways how it can be applied to something that I am truly passionate about, such as outdoors and running. Or in a different context approaching it from an engineering point of view how we can be more efficient with already existing solutions.  
4. You believe you can change and grow  
After spending 11 weeks at Turing, I have no doubt in my mind that I love programming. I also have zero doubt in my mind that I can improve my skills as a software developer. Given the endless spectrum provided by engineering field of programming, I don’t see running out of room for improvement and opportunities to change ever.

#### Journey Map  
Personal reflection:  
We have created a map based on one of our group members' experience going through end of the module evaluation. In general the Journey Map is a great tool to map out the end user experience, identify steps in the process that could be improved to further improve the user experience. A Journey Map forces one to think through a simple experience in a very detailed way which details could easily remain overlooked through conersations, general brain storming sessions.

#### Micro Agressions  
Personal reflection:  
This can be a very sensitive topic, but in general the key is that we all have to be sensitive to others' perception of how our words are received. Even if we speak without any intention to hurt others, with limited and/or no knowledge about one's background/experience, some words/expressions might be hurtful for that individual.

### [Personal website](http://laszlo.thebaloghs.com/)
### [Technical Blog Post](http://laszlo.thebaloghs.com/blog/how-to-add-own-task-to-rakefile.html)
### Private Company tracker  
Available through a Trello board, shared with Meg and Lia
### Seven cold emails sent to seven different contacts from the company tracker  
4 already completed, 3 more to sent out by end of this week. One meeting already completed, another scheduled for January 25, 2017.
### Attend two networking events  
Attended Ruby Boulder events: Ruby Boulder presentation night and Ruby Boulder coding event.
### Paragraph reflection on project management strategies you used in your projects (Bike Share and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?  
During our Little Shop Project work we used the Agile process and it worked really well. We have kept our Master branch fully functional and up to date. It took a little while to get into a smooth flow, but that was all part of the learning experience. We were able to keep an efficient Git flow going which relied on all team members being equally commited to the process as well as we held each other accountable for not only reviewing pull requests in a timely fashion, but to provide constructive feedback.
### Paragraph reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process  
I made sure to discuss any concerns and questions from mismatches during Git workflow. That has been a specific feedback item from a past paired project that I feel being more comfortable with Git workflow now, I am also better at communicating concerns/suggestions about it.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### [Agile Project Management](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management.md)  
It was great to see this principal being introduced to students at Turing. In today's environment and especially within the industry we are planning to work after graduation Agile is widely used and the sooner we get familiar with it and the more experience we build using it through our projects, the better we will be positioned to become efficient members of any teams from day one.
#### [Feedback II](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)  
Great session to explore uncomfortable situations and prepare everyone for upcoming projects with a set of basic skills to handle similar situations. However within our cohort I cannot think of a single persion that it would be difficult to work with... :-)
#### [Finding Opportunities](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)  
Just like networking, finding opprtunities and more importantly finding people who can connect us with those opportunities is definitely a skill in itself. Great suggestions how to leverage LinkedIn, online searches and tools to be able to reach out to people and get a conversation started.
#### [Johari Window](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md)  
Very interesting session: receiving feedback from the people we worked with on previous projects. The feedback was a bit raw: received multiple sheets from various people. The intention behind receiving such feedback is good and constructive feedback is very important. I feel this session/process could definitely use an app that would help to provide feedback and help the recipient to consolidate such feedback and identify potential improvement areas.
#### [Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)  
This is a topic where I feel the least comfortable. Blaming it mainly on my personality, I just simply don't feel very comfortable at networking events, but at the same time I realize that such events are essential to build up our own network of professionals for the future. A short and efficient introduction is very much necessary and other than practicing it, using our own elevator pitch over and over again it is difficult to fine tune it and make it more efficient.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

### To Jesse Shipley based on our work together on the Bike Share project:  
Great working with you on the Bike-Share project! I appreciated very much that you set the tone with your calmness for the team. Besides that always ready to listen to all the opinions and decide on the next steps.
You did a great job of pushing through the “ugly” pieces, such as CSV import, which never seems to be a popular choice.
I loved the fact that following our technical discussions, you still put in effort to research a subject further to understand it as best as possible.  

### To Marisa Burton based on our work together on the Bike Share project:
I am glad we were able to pair finally on the Bike-Share project together and get to know you a bit more.
Behind the mask of a quiet person is a bright future programmer who is always open to learning one who can learn fast. You wanted to help the team to succeed and always looked for ways to contribute. You might not be a loudest member of the team, but  still a fighter.
I also loved that you were not afraid of asking questions when you had to. That is a difficult thing to do as we all try to balance pride vs keep making progress through the development.

### To Annie Wolff based on our work together on the Bike Share project:  
Great to have you as part of our team on the Bike-Share project!
I liked the energy that you always brought to the team and how you helped to push the project forward.
You have a talent to bring concepts to life very-very quickly and deliver on what you committed both with high quality and on time. You were not afraid of taking up on the most complex part of the implementation (Weather-dashboard) and at the same time pair with another team member and helping along the way. Eye opening way of contributing to a project!

### To Drew Palazzari based on our work together on the Little Shop project:
Drew has a personality that makes him an immediate culture fit for any team! He is very easy to work with, works extremely hard, works fast and a team member anyone can always rely on! I enjoyed working with Drew very much and seeing how quickly he can bring a concept to life. He is great at getting things up and running, leaving plenty of time for group review and refactoring.

### To Nick Gheorghita based on our work together on the Little Shop project:
I liked working with Nick on our Little Shop project. Nick works very fast and never shy to ask questions or express his opinion about any details in a constructive way. That is extremely helpful in a team environment, where reviewing a potential solution from various angles is very necessary. Nick is always there to help and he is very efficient to be the wave breaker within a team: bringing initial concept to life.

### To Daniel Rodriguez based on our work together on the Little Shop project:
Daniel was our Project Manager during our Little Shop Project. He did a great job of keeping the project team on track, document the user stories and handle communication between our team and the Product Manager (Casey). During our team discussions, capturing action items, writing the DTR and other documentation and communication details were always up to date thanked to Daniel’s effort. As a programmer, Daniel is very open to any ideas and suggestions, but more importantly he has a very solid knowledge that any team would be happy to build on.

### Being a Community Member

### From lacey Knaff and Chelsea Skovgaard, leaders of Verou Posse:  
Laszlo's genuine kidness is really hard to come by, Chelsea and I felt incredibly lucky to have him as a part of the Verou posse and to get to know him as a person. He is always willing to lend a helping hand and step up when needed to share his knowledge and perspective. When Chelsea and I asked for people to volunteer to give spikes during posse time Laszlo volunteered without hesitation. Not only are we happy to have had Laszlo as a part of the Verou Posse, but we look forward to continuing to get to know him as a developer and friend! 

### From Jesse Shipley based on our work together on the Bike Share project:  
Working with Laszlo was an outstanding experience.
His inviting approach to tutoring, guidance and overall team work was 
really refreshing to have in our first larger group project.
His attitude and enthusiasm never shifted even when things were getting busy/stressful.
He made it a point to be in charge of keeping us smiling, and in an upbeat mood.
He did this without fail, even when he might not have been in the mood to.
I would love to work with Laszlo again in a future project, and his ability
to include everyone in our group into every bit of our project really encompasses
what Turing is about.

### From Marisa Burton based on our work together on the Bike Share project:
Lazlo was such a pleasure to work with. He just seems to understand programming so naturally, and he’s a great and patient teacher. He is the main reason why we did so well in this project as he was our main foundation. He quickly walked me through errors I was having and explained things so I could quickly understand my problem and keep working. I really appreciate the time he spent working with me as he really made me feel a part of the team. I learned a lot on this project, and a good reason for that is due to Lazlo.

### From Annie Wolff based on our work together on the Bike Share project:  
Lazlo is one of the hardest workers I have ever encountered. He takes his contribution to the group very seriously and never fails to deliver high quality code. Beyond this, he is hilariously funny and a truly wonderful person to be around.

### From Drew Palazzari based on our work together on the Little Shop project:
Positive Feedback: Working with Laszlo has been a real pleasure. Laszlo is an excellent coder, a great personality, and an incredibly intelligent person. His love for tables and thorough testing is legendary (and contagious) and I hope that I get paired with him on a project again.
Constructive Feedback: I think Laszlo's code and intelligence is very high level. Sometimes, this makes it difficult to follow. It would behoove Laszlo to do better at explaining his code in some instances. This is a very small issue however. Considering that English is not Laszlo's primary language, he does a wonderful job of communicating.

### From Nick Gheorghita based on our work together on the Little Shop project:
Calm and cool under pressure, Laszlo is a fantastic addition to any team. His attention to detail and unbounded love for robust testing is an invaluable quality to have within any group. His knowledge is thorough, and if you ever run into a problem, Laszlo’s always there, with genuine interest, to help you arrive at the best solution. Would love to work on another project with him, and look forward to seeing all the cool things he builds.

## E: Community Participation

I attended the Verou Posse regularly. I like that it provides a very different perspective, spending so much time with backend development. One of my favorite topic was working SVG code building animated buttons.

At one of the Verou Posse sessions, I also had a presentation about the Jekyll static website content management system.

Through the first four weeks of this module, I paired with Mod 1 students on at least Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

I am in the process to get more involved in supporting code development for the Boulder Food Rescue effort. Next week I will meet with developers currently supporting the project to get more engaged with the code optimization effort. Previously I have participated in their code review and code optimization effort as part of the Boulder Ruby coding meetup. I am working on increasing my involvement with the project going forward.
