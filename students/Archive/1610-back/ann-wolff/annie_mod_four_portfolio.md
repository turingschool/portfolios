## Final Assessment

### Rubric

#### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

#### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

#### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

#### 6. Documentation (NOT GRADED)

* 1: Project has insufficient documentation


#### 7. Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Independent Work

### Quantified Self API

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/quantified-self-api)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self-back-end.md)

This was an extension of the week-one Quantified Self project. We built an API to handle the foods data that we needed for he meal tracker. It's built on Express.js with a Node backend. We also used Knex to connnect to a PostgreSQL database. Lots of new technologies! It was a challenging and exciting extension to the original project and it was cool to learn a new way to build apps without Rails.

For my open source contribution, I attended Code for Denver meetups and worked on their Denver Re:Imagine Project. Its an app to allow residents of a building to create a campaign to request recyling. I worked on a feature for the home page that allows users to search for their apartment in the database and see a prompt to create a new if a campaign does not exsist yet.

## Group Work

### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DavidKnott/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Built off of a starter kit, Quantified Self was our first exploration of using JavaScript and jQuery to create interactive UI. We learned how to store data without a database and how to wire up buttons and forms to execute user requests. It was tough to jump into a new technology but rewarding to know that we can use what we know to pick up new skills.

#### Specification Adherence

- 3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

#### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

#### HTML/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

#### JS syntax and Style

- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.

#### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

#### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.

### Capstone - Johari Window

* [Front-End GitHub URL](https://github.com/lucyconklin/johari-window)
* [Back-End GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Originally proposed by Lucy, this project was meant to improve Allison's ability to run the Johari Window reflection exercise. We decoupled the front-end and back-end of this project so we ended up with a React app and a Rails API. Making these two technologies work together was a new challenge and taught us a lot about how a front-end team and back-end team could work together. Unfortunately, we were not able to get our React app to play happily with Auth0 for authentication, but I learned a lot about React while wrestling with the problem. 

#### 1. Project Management

*   4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions

#### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

#### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

#### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

#### 5. Documentation

*   4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor

#### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Team has expertly implemented features to follow accessibility best practices.

## Professional Development

[Deliverables](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1610-b/annie_wolff.md)

## Feedback & Community

This module, I again served as an SAB representative. It was sometimes frustrating but always rewarding. We made some active plans to address problems in the community this module and planned a fun event at View House for Final Friday.

I also helped to faciliate a Gear Up session on automation with some fellow Mod4 students. We planned the session over a few weeks and led during Week 5. I think that having students lead Gear Up is a good way to encourage participation. I also think that having a smaller group encouraged everyone to share their thoughts and led to a better discussion. Overall, I had a positive experience and would be excited to see this idea continue.

### Feedback from Me

**To Lucy Conklin**  
"Lucy, thank you for taking on the thankless job that is Project Manager for Johari Window. It was a great idea for a project and I loved making something that makes a difference for Turing. I appreciated your patience on Auth0. I really thought that we were going to get it working.  
Most of all, though, I admire your drive to finish this crazy app. I was ready to throw in the towel, but that's not your style and I really value that."

**To David Knott**  
"David, your energy is infectious and it makes you a joy to work with! I enjoyed digging into a new technology stack with you and I learned a lot from the way that you approach a topic you don't understand. Never stop learning!"

**To Drew Palazzari**  
"Drew! You are so. fun. to work with! Even though our job the first week of the cappstone project wasn't that exciting, I had a blast putting it together with you. And even though most of our johari code didn't make it into the final app, it was challenging and rewarding pairing with you on it!"

### Feedback to Me

**From Drew Palazzari**  
"It was a pleasure working with you for the first time. I still remember our Johari PORO; it was (and still is!) amazing.
It lives on in my memory, as does the act of constructing it. I also admire your tenacity while working with AuthO. I'm 
sure it was incredibly frustrating, and part of me is happy you were able to deal with the struggle. Considering it was 
a new tech stack, I think you did an excellent job in successfully building the application to the project owner's and 
group's desires. I would happily work with you again; at Turing, and beyond!"
