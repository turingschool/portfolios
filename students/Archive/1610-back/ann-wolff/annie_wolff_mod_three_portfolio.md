# Annie Wolff - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was a little intimidated by Mod 3 so I came in with the goal that I would keep up with the class and try to get the best grades that I could. I think that I achieved this goal, although this was certainly the most difficulty I've had a Turing yet.
I'm proud of the group work that I did this Mod, though I wish that my solo work had been better. I also set the goal that I would make time to really start my job search during this mod. I am happy with the leads that I've drummed up so far and I think that the work I have done will make searching during the next mod easier.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This is a summation of my individual projects for Module 3

### Projects

#### RehearsalTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/rehearsal_tracker)
* [Production Site](http://rehearsaltracker.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

Running a theatre is a logistics nightmare and diseminating imformation to the differenct technical departments is very challenging. By providing a place to collect the tasks and notes that come from rehearsal meetings into one place and providing tags to alert the different departments when tasks need their attention, my app streamlines the process. It allow the stage manager to set clear expectations and track the progress of tasks as they are passed off.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Pinspiration

   *   0: No

### Pivotal Tracker Gem

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/pivotal-tracker/tree/api_version5)

Work on updating Pivotal Tracker Gem to work with v5 of the API. I contributed the readme, the memberships resources endpoint, and a proxy class to allow to gem to mock ActiveRecord's chained methods.

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

rails_engine is an exercise in creating an internal API that serves up business anyltics. It features endpoints that return information on customers, merchants, invoices, invoice items and transactions.

##### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

##### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This session focused on bias and how a society of people with even a small amount of bias leads to overall segregation. I have frequently heard the argument that diversity quotas are antithetical to true diversity, but I thought that the Parable of the Polygons game was a clear demonstration that a demand for diversity is the only way to reverse these effects.

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation will continue to take jobs that were previously held by people of all social classes and education. As a country, we're going to be facing social changes that we must address to ensure our future as a united nation. I have been thinking a lot about how I can contribute to limiting the effects of this problem and I haven't come up with a lot of hopeful thoughts yet. I think the most important thing to do is to continue to discuss it and consider it when making decisions about public leader and policy.

#### Univeral Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In thinking about this in the context of the automation talk, I think that UIB is a possible solution, but certainly not a "foregone conclusion" as Elon Musk suggests. It's a new idea that I don't believe much of the nation will embrace right away, but the more we discuss it, the more likely it is to become more popular. I also believe that investing in early childhood education could allow citizens to achieve the higher education levels that are required to obtain the jobs that automation will produce.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Amy Kintner: "Amy is a trooper. I worked with her on our Cloney Island project and she had the unenviable task of making GoogleOAuth work for our extremely convoluted login path. Even though it seemed to break every day, she always took the time to fix it and learn something new in the process. She's also a true pleasure to work with and be around. She wrote me the most amazing sonnet about email for my Shakespeare branded project management tool that I proudly display on the home page of my app."

To Molly Brown: "Molly might just have the honor of being my favorite person at Turing. Besides being a dedicated worker who will tackle projects singlehandedly and deliver amazing work, she's also very supportive and fun to be around. I truly appreciated her work on our Cloney Island project and I really respect her evenhanded approach to discussions and group work."

### Being a Community Member

"Thank you for taking on the thankless task of product owner. Your user stories were clear, you posted them efficiently, and you were flexible in their interpretation. I think you really hit the right balance of controlling the execution of the user stories, while also keeping us from getting too bogged down in the non-essential details. Rolling them out in batches may have made the process even more focused. I also continue to appreciate and depend on the positive atmosphere you create in the classroom. You are a leader and a supporter, you are doing a great job on SAB, and you are actively setting the foundation for some really exciting opportunities" --Lucy Conklin

"I had the pleasure of working with Annie on our Cloney Island project, during which we – the ladies – cloned Pinterest. Annie was our Project Owner, a role we came up with after much discussion about the complexity of the project and its scope. In this role, Annie was our direct contact with the “client,” thus did all of the communicating with Casey. In keeping true to this role, Annie guided us through the process of GitHub rebasing, branch-naming, and acted as the primary organizer of our Git activity.  She also took on the setup of “Likes,” the polymorphic part of our database setup, and presided over the daunting task that came with setting up the proper associations and targets in the models, views, and controllers.
That said, Annie was also a delight to work with because she never took any of the work or any of our roles too seriously. We laughed a lot, and we got a lot done. It was by far the most fun I’ve yet had at Turing and was an experience I expect to go unmatched in my time yet to come." --Amy Kintner

"I'm really glad I got paired with you a project this hard!" --Dan Rodriguez

### Playing a Part

This was my first module as an SAB representative. I'm really happy that I was nominated, because it has been a really rewarding experience. I also served as a prework guide and got to meet my guidee for the first time during week six! It was great to talk to her in person. I think that she will succeed in Mod1.
