# Annie Wolff - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

This module was very exciting! I enjoyed module one, but there is something so amazing about building something that you can show to others. I enjoyed learning rails and I feel like it actually gave me a taste of what web development is all about. Now that I have these skills, I come up with a new idea for a cool website every day. 

I stretched myself professionally by reaching out to people who could potentially be valuable members of my network. I've really found it valuable to explore career options and talk to other about thier experience. It's energizing to look into the many oppurtunities that can be open to me when I'm finished at Turing.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

##### 1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 4: Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree of specificity and accuracy without assistance

##### 2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

##### 3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

##### 4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 4: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods independently and can articulately discuss the difference between relationships at the model and database level

##### 5. Rails Style

 * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

##### 6. Testing

 * 4: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently

##### 7. Collaboration

 * 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [BikeShare](https://github.com/wlffann/bike-share)

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

##### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

##### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

##### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

##### 5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

##### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### [Scoopful](https://scoopful.herokuapp.com/)

This project is the result of the Little Shop of Orders assignment, which encouraged us to practice the Cart-Order lifecycle, database design, front-end styling, authentication and authorization. It is a bulk food ordering site that allows a user to choose how many pounds of a product they would like to purchase. 

### Individual Projects

#### [MixMaster](https://agile-oasis-92928.herokuapp.com/artists)

We followed a tutorial for this project, which was our first introduction to rails. We learned how to use rails helpers, commands and files by building an application that allowed users to add artists, songs and build playlists. 

#### [JobTracker](https://wolff-job-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

##### 1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

##### 2) Routes

* 4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

##### 3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

##### 4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

##### 5) Views

* 2.5: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
* 2.5: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

##### 6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

##### 7) Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

#### [TutorialShare](https://tutorial-share.herokuapp.com)

This project was made to fill the requirments of the RailsMini Spec. It is a site inspired by Instructables.com that allows users to create and share craft tutorials and browse other user's projects by category. It features authentication and authorization of users and admins. Users can create and edits projects and onlt view other user's submissions. Only admins can create categories. 

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Grit

Grit is the combination of hard work and passsion. It can often be the determining factor in a person's ability to succeed in a challenging situation and many people are looking for ways to develop grit in themselves and others. Grittiness is an important attribute to develop as a Turing student, and we brainstormed ways to promote this attribute in ourselves. One solution is to look for ways to make our work more meaningful, such as implementing our skills on side projects that we care about and help other students to learn difficult material.

#### Journey Mapping

Journey Mapping is all about considering how someone's background and experience could effect their interaction with a progam or process. By empathizing with the user of a product and attempting to understand how they approach it, developers can improve their process and results. To practice this exercise, our group journey mapped our decision to attend Turing and discovered motovations, pain points and results.

#### MicroAgressions

This Gear Up provoked more conversation amoungst the community than any other I have participated in. Before and after the session, I had discussions on the validity of microagressions, and the difference between impact and intent. I attended the small group session and I found it to be a very sensitive and productive conversation. Between this session and the interactions I had outside of it, I found this to be a very effective idea to introduce into the Turing community.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication & Agile Project Management

Strong leadership and clarity of purpose are important to the success of an agile project. We discussed ways to encourage these needs in a group setting by encouraging and identifying the stages of development of a team. A good project manager can recognize these stages and help the group move forward. I was not a project manager for any of the projects that we did, but I tried to be a facilitator of good project management. I tried to be always open to taking tasks delegated to me, ask questions and listen carefully. I was always ready to accept an opinon that was different from mine if it would mean more success for the group.

#### Feedback II

Feedback is something that gets quite a bit of emphasis here at Turing, and I've appreciated the opportunity to reflect on how and why I give it. I have been using right and wrong spotting in my retros since we learned it and it has helped me to parse challenging feedback and gain meaning from it. On our final project, I recieved the feeback that I should take more time to write code that does more of the work for me, rather than trying to carry more of the coginitive load myself. While I want to defend the code that I wrote, I can also recognize that I should plan more carefully to make my job easier. The Johari window activity helped me to learn how others view me compared to how I view myself. I appreciated having outside input and I was surprised by some of the qualities that others gave me that I did not ascribe to myself. I've tried to reasses my self-image to incorporate this valuable feedback.

#### Finding Oppurtunities

In this session, we learned that the most important part of finding oppurtunites is beginning your networking early. The thing that struck me the most is that most job offers occur before the job is ever posted online. Some strategies for networking include using LinkedIn to reach out to people, going to MeetUps, following interesting people on Twitter and using BuiltIn Colorado to find companies you are interested in.

#### Cold Outreach

As strange as it feels to email someone out of the blue, I have had quite a bit of success making new connections with my cold outreach emails. I have scheduled several meetings with people at companies I find very interesting and one of my cohort-mates has already gotten a job interview from her cold-outreach!

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

To Kyle Heppenstall: "Kyle, I only wish I could have the attention to detail that you have. I hope that you don't feel that your rigorous code reviews went unappreciated, because I found them to be invaluable. I appreciate your feedback and I am going to model my future group workflow on your example. In addition to this, you clearly have a great grasp on the material we've covered. Moreover, you're always looking for new and better ways to apply what we've learned, which opens the door to the group learning and exploring new content. As we continue together in our cohort, I hope to get to know you more and continue to learn from you. You can be a difficult person to read, but I learned that you're really funny and are passionate about a great many things. I can't wait to work with you again in the future!"

To Amy Kintner: "I love collaborating with Amy. She has a mind built to absorb information and apply it in interesting ways, which is invaluable when you're stuck without a solution to a problem. She's willing to work hard, play hard and share a meaningful conversation with you whenever you need it. On Scoopful, she fought through sickness to serve as our project manager. Her dedication to making our project great was unmatched and her management helped balance our group's personalities. I appreciate all of the work she did for us, especially the work she did feverish. I hope to work with her more in the future!"

To Mike Schutte: "Mike! Your infinite curiosity and willingness to stretch your abilities makes you an extremely valuable team member and a pleasure to work with. You're enthusiastic when celebrating success and undaunted when approaching failures. I truly believe that you drove everyone in our team to do the best work that we could do while contributing huge amounts of work yourself. Also, learning new things with you is fun! I've really enjoyed the times we've spent puzzling out an algorithm or an active record query together. My only delta for this project is that your drive and willingness to pull long hours puts pressure on the team to move quickly and keep up with your pace. I believe that this desire to forge ahead comes purely from a love of the work, but in a group setting it creates a feeling that everyone should keep up with you to be able to contribute meaningfully. Slow down a little and enjoy it!"

To Marisa Burton: "Marisa is someone I care deeply about. She is someone who gives back to the community consistently and who takes her role as a group member seriously. She never fails to ask questions when she is not confident in a topic and truly listens to and learns from your answer. Beyond this, she cares deeply about the learning and experience of every member in the group. She is a model community member who I look to for leadership and friendship.

Actionable: Don't let yourself be frustrated when bugs and errors pop up. You've got the tools and the knowledge to solve any problem."

To Lazlo Balogh: "Lazlo is one of the hardest workers I have ever encountered. He takes his contribution to the group very seriously and never fails to deliver high quality code. Beyond this, he is hilariously funny and a truly wonderful person to be around."

To Jesse Shipley: "Jesse is a dedicated and enthusiastic team member. He served as project manager and was the solid foundation that made our group so successful. He is one of the most even-headed people I have ever encountered, which was so valuable when the stress of the project got tough. On top of the pressure of Turing, he has many outside responsibilites that he seemd to juggle effortlessly. He's a wonderful community member and I'm so glad to have him on my team."

### Being a Community Member

"I really appreciated the opportunity to work with you on this project. You were incredibly reliable and productive on everything you did. I felt like you consistently took on some of the most challenging aspects of the project without complaining or getting stressed out about it. I also felt like you struck a proper balance between putting out your opinions for the team to consider and being flexible / putting the team first. Your ideas around how to setup the initial schema and saving costs for orders were awesome and made the whole project go more smoothly. I also appreciated your mentorship on styling and figuring out sass. My only piece of constructive feedback is to have a bit more attention to details on pull requests. I occasionally felt like I was the only one commenting on specific lines in pull requests and would have appreciated some more line-by-line feedback on my code (constructive and positive). I really enjoyed working with you and hopefully we get to do it again!" -- Kyle Heppenstall

"Annie: I'm so stoked we got to work on this project together! I've always respected how much innovative drive you bring to programming. You seem undaunted by the need to explore and learn new technologies, and I think it gives the group an extended sense of can-do attitude. In terms of critical feedback, I recommend working 'smarter not harder' in terms of methods and tools. You obviously know how to get things running perfectly, but there were a few instances (e.g., not using before blocks in the specs, using Ruby methods over ActiveRecord or Rails methods) where you could have saved yourself many lines of code and cognitive load with simpler solutions. Overall, I'm completely grateful for your commitment to defining and sticking to a clean and efficient workflow process. It definitely elevated our project to the next level. Thanks so much for all your work and meaningful contributions to Scoopful." -- Mike Schutte

"It was amazing to get the chance to work with Annie on our final project. She has limitless energy and a drive to get things accomplished quickly and early, which I admire. She has a high-level understanding of everything we’ve learned so far and was always ready to jump in a lend a hand. Additionally, her previous front-end experience was invaluable; Annie was the go-to HAML “expert” of the group, and she helped us solve a couple pesky issues. She also made us a hand-drawn logo for the project, which was an above-and-beyond gesture that really helped the group have a sense of ownership with the website and project as a whole. She was an integral part of the team, and I look forward to working with her again." -- Amy Kintner 

"Annie was amazing as a group partner in our Bike Share project. I always enjoyed her upbeat attitude in class, and eagerness to bond and become friends as a large class. This attitude was even more apparent in a group of four. She immediately found ways to make everything more exciting. Her planning, preparedness and strong technical toolset was vital to the progress of our project." -- Jesse Shipley

"You bring a huge amount of positive energy to any team that is just very inspiring." -- Laslo Balogh

"Annie was a pleasure to work with. She is both quick-witted and is a quick learner. Annie was a major force and foundation in our team. We wouldn’t have finished the project without her major contributions. I was very appreciative of her walking me through the steps of design, and she took the time to explain things to me when I was having trouble. I really enjoyed working on the final iteration with her, as she made it look so easy when other people were struggling. She was always reminding us to smile even when we felt a bit overworked and tired, and that helped lighten up the atmosphere." -- Marisa Burton

## E: Community Participation

I wish that I had been a more active member of the community this module. My greatest contribution came from pairing with Module One students. I stayed as open in my schedule as I could and had some really great pairings on projects that I had not worked on before. I developed a relationship with a few students and taught them some of the techniques that I use to plan out the work I do. Moving forward, I want to be a prework guide and hopefully continue to be available to pair with students.

I joined the Turing Lab posse, and helped them to get the 3D printer running again (almost). In the next module, I would love to explore making more and hopefully give a tutorial using my sewing skills.
