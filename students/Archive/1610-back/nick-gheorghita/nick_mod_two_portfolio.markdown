## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### Bike-Share : https://github.com/cews7/bike-share

If the project was graded, add your evaluation scores and notes. If the project was not graded, add a reflection.
1. Functional Expectations

3.5: Application fulfills base expectations
2. ActiveRecord

4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
3. User Experience and Conventions

4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.
4. Code Organization/Quality

3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.
5. Testing

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
6. Working Collaboratively

2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.

### Individual Projects

#### Job Tracker : http://jobtracker100.herokuapp.com
###              : https://github.com/njgheorghita/job-tracker

1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.
2) Routes

4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.
3) Controllers

3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.
4) ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.
5) Views

3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
6) User Experience

4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.
7) Testing

4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

### MixMaster : https://mixmaster.herokuapp.com

  I had a lot of fun building this project, so I thought to include it.

### Blogger : https://github.com/njgheorghita/blogger
  
  This project served as a great introduction into rails and the MVC concept. 

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

  While a single microaggression can be brushed aside, it’s the continuity and repetition of microaggressions where they really cause damage — since i’m not frequently on the receiving end of microaggressions (that are racially/sexually charged), it’s difficult to understand how these microaggressions are so damaging. Firsthand accounts must be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer invaluable insights into the harm microaggressions can cultivate over time.

  being told to “fly back to my country” would undoubtedly upset me
     yet
  a foreigner coming up to me and saying “hello” in english would not offend me in the least

  The form of microaggressions i’ve experienced are indirect and usually disguised in humor, a good way to make the joker aware that the humor isn’t appreciated is to ask them to explain the joke in better detail until it gets awkward

If you witness a microaggression, don’t engage the person causing it, engage the victim in conversation.

#### Journey Mapping

  This was an enlightening journey into the experience of our users. Especially in the back-end program, we lose sight of the user that actually uses the app. While it may seem mundane and exasperating, you can gain valuable insight into how to improve your application by going through the user experience step by step. Not only once, but multiple times. This will help you identify the holes in your application and patch them up before deployment. 

#### Grit 

  If you’re not aware of when you’re in need of a break, that could become problematic. even if youre under a tight deadline, just stepping away from the problems for 5 minutes can be enormously helpful

Finding passion within your project is crucial, especially for a side project, if you’re not enjoying what you pursue on the side it’s going to be unnecessarily difficult to put in the time to make the effort worthwhile

Brainstorm 2-3 ways you can imbue your work over the next week and next inning to be more "filled with purpose."

Tie the skills you’re learning to a particular field/occupation that you are positive you’d enjoy. Even if it’s not the first job out of school, keep this side dream alive and hustle and you’ll eventually end up where you want to be.

Write 3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Project Management

  As a disciple of the unorganized approach to work, I place a high value on structure and those willing to create / enforce it (as long as the enforcement is done fairly). After LittleShop, I am a huge fan of Waffle. It makes splitting up work fantastically organized, and avoids the nightmare scenario of two people spending hours building the same features. 
  Listening to the evolution of project management from waterfall to agile is very interesting to me. Even though (hindsight is 20/20) it seems obviosu that agile works better, it's interesting that it took so long for companies to understand that this is how you improve your bottom line, and it's shocking to think that there are still companies out there today who use waterfall! 

#### Cold Outreach

  It's awkward at first, but I've come to enjoy cold outreach (even though it still requires a lot more time than I'd like to spend on it). Especially while I'm a student, it's fantastic to have the "student angle" when reaching out to these companies. Not only to network / weed out potential opportunities. But also to learn. For example, I've taken an interest to machine learning/blockchain/data science which isn't really in the curriculum. This gives me plenty to talk about when reaching out. 
  
  - Lauren Moores : Data Scientist @ Tala
    - busy in january, reschedule come march
  - Wyatt Flochman : Machine Learning Engineer @ Zingle
    - already video chatted, reach out whenever
  - Matt Loftus : Software Engineer @ Twitter
    - video chat set for next thursday
  - Tommy Ward : Big Data Consultant @ WorldWide Technologies
    - phonecall set for next week
  - Dave Nair : Junior Data Scientiest @ iDatalytics
    - got phone number, mostly communicated through linkedin messages, asking questions about his work
  - Royce Hanes : Sr. Software Engineer @ Pandora
    - waiting to hear back
  - Nick Teneboe : Software Engineer @ ZestFinance
    - got in contact, next step = set up time to chat

#### Networking

  As one of those people who dreads the thought of walking into a room of strangers and small-talking my way through two houres, i'm undergoing a slight change of heart. Keeping in mind that everybody (well most everybody) is there for the same reason, to grow their network, helps make the initial approach much more comfortable. Of course, social lubrication helps. 
  
  1st networking event - HackerX 
    Met with 12 companies, was interested in 5 with whom I will follow up 
    
  2nd networking event - Bitcoin / Blockchain meetup

#### Feedback II

  This was a particularly cool session. Obviously, it's always awesome to hear people say good things about you! The Johari Window was a great exercise, though I would have like more options to choose from and/or a separate set of words that are negatives / technically focused. It's hard to know what areas you should improve upon if you only hear great feedback about yourself. 

#### Finding Opportunities

  You always hope that your dream job is going to fall into your lap upon graduation. But, the reality is that nobody's going to come looking for you, you have to find them. In order to find your dream job, you have to do a pretty exhaustive search through all the opportunities out there. Even though i've spent many hours putting together my job tracker, I know there are still plenty of jobs out there that I would adore, and I don't even know when or where they exist. So even though i've got my tracker put together, i'm dedicating time over mid-mod break to continue to explore what kind of opportunities / industries exist. Cast a wide net!

Include takeaways and deliverables from each session.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

Ethan Bennett - Our shared technical interests have led to a lot of time spent together exploring topics out of class. Ethan's always bringing new, interesting knowledge to the table, finding phenomenal resources, and continually exploring. Having someone like him is huge for my motivation to keep exploring topics outside the curriculum and to stay hungry.  Looking forward to leading Armstrong together next mod.

David Knott - Working with David was a pleasure. He’s intelligent, knows his material, and is not afraid to take on challenging problems. 100% reliable. David came through multiple times with unique solutions by diving deep into ActiveRecord, which improved the overall outcome of our project immensely. Always a fun guy to be around, even while banging his head on the computer for hours trying to figure out what broke our database. Look forward to continue learning and building code with this guy.

Laszlo Balogh - Calm and cool under pressure, Laszlo is a fantastic addition to any team. His attention to detail and unbounded love for robust testing is an invaluable quality to have within any group. His knowledge is thorough, and if you ever run into a problem, Laszlo’s always there, with genuine interest, to help you arrive at the best solution. Would love to work on another project with him, and look forward to seeing all the cool things he builds.

Improvement Suggestion: It was a struggle to come up with an improvement suggestion. Don’t be afraid to be more vocal, but for the most part keep doing you!

Dan Rodriguez - I’m stoked I was able to work on a project with Dan. His calm demeanor kept the mood light, even when we’ve been grinding out the hours. Dan had no problem taking up the responsibility of being product manager, and he killed it. Kept everyone on top of the current project status, regularly updated the waffle, and kept us on track. Not only that, but he was always handy with a clever solution to any code challenges we ran into. Look forward to building cool things in the future together.

### Being a Community Member

David Knott - Nick, you inspire me.  Straight and simple I love your energy and optimism about going into the machine learning and data science industries.  Your passion leads me to reflect more about what job  would make my eyes light up with enthusiasm day after day.  In terms of our project together I felt that you were a huge asset because whenever I felt stuck you helped keep the ball rolling forward.  Lastly, our website looks amazing because of your styling which I appreciate a lot because styling is one of the things I struggle most with.  Bravo!

Drew Palazzari - Feedback for Nick: Nick is a lot of fun to work with. He brings a code attitude as well as excellent code to the table. Working with him, there was no challenge that was insurmountable. I hope I work with him on future projects again.

Constructive Feedback: It is hard for me to think of something that Nick needs to improve upon. I would say that a good area to improve, would be to be more available when working remote. Often times, the group would wait for a good amount of time waiting for Nick to check out a pull request. This was not a problem in this particular project (it was not too hard) but it would be a problem for a bigger, more difficult project.

Ethan Bennett - We’ve been able to stumble our way through some pretty cool stuff, and personally, I feel like I would have been less successful at scratching the surface of these topics if I’d been trying to do it alone. You’re really ambitious, and it’s definitely contagious. I’m looking forward to all the Armstrong/Python/blockchain stuff becoming a reality next mod!

Laszlo Balogh - I liked working with Nick on our Little Shop project. Nick works very fast and never shy to ask questions or express his opinion about any details in a constructive way. That is extremely helpful in a team environment, where reviewing a potential solution from various angles is very necessary. Nick is always there to help and he is very efficient to be the wave breaker within a team: bringing initial concept to life.

Improvement suggestion: try to reduce a bit the amount of time needed for paired programming. Paired programming is very helpful, but I feel individual work time also teaches us how to be more self reliant.

## E: Community Participation

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?

Minimal participation in this mod in order to maximize participation in the next mod. Ethan and I decided to take over the Armstrong Posse next mod. So, this mod more time was spent preparing for this responsiblity than actively participating. We have some big ideas we're looking forward to bring to the posse, moving from a math focus - to a high level / technical skills focus. In order to succeed in this goal, we had to spend just about every spare hour learning for ourselves to provide a super posse experience.
