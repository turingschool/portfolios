## A: End of Module Assessment

## Rubric

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Satisfactory Progress
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

_The links controller is a bit messy and could be refactored significantly. There is also a method called "find_or_create_by" and would eliminate the if statement in the create method. Also, the create read should live on the link model not on the controller_

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

_Use conventions for jquery or js but not both mixed_

### 4. Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

_The hot reads api needs more testing, there is nothing testing any validations_

### 5. User Interface
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

_Interface is fine but could use work._

### 6. Workflow
* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Open Source

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/njgheorghita/debug_traceTransaction)
* [Research gist](https://gist.github.com/njgheorghita/d1dd26d95225e463858d69acf8838119)

[WIP] A debugger for transactions run on the testrpc blockhain. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Quantified Self

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Missing the first two days of js class definitely influenced our success with this project. Though, 
Ethan and I were successfully able to implement basic functionality, and I particularly became with javascript 
techniques including filtering, dom manipulation via jquery, and node.js which was very helpful preparation for the final.

#### Capstone

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/njgheorghita/bookchain)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/capstone_project_overview)

Bookchain: A decentralized library built on the ethereum blockchain, with a react frontend. This project was awesome, 
and while there are a lot of distractions in mod4 that can be tricky to navigate, i'm grateful for the 
opportunity to explore a technology that excites me. 

### 1. Project Management

*   3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.

Thanks for showing me the ropes with Solidity. I appreciated your patience with all of my questions and your 
willingness to teach. I already said this to Jesse, but I wanted to say it to you as well. Thanks for picking 
up the slack when I was doing my interviewing stuff.  -- Robbie

Nick: dude blockchain. Huge pain in the ass, but totally mitigated by the successes and awesome project team. 
I learned a ton, thanks for keeping in there during our talks about broken code, possible answers and just flat 
out impossibilities. Second project together and another great one in the books. Real excited to see what 
this technology turns into and wouldn't have even dipped a toe in if it wasn't for you. -- Jesse

## D: Professional Skills
  exempt

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Led the armstrong posse through an exploration of blockchain technology, from high-level concepts to in-depth code-alongs. 

Gave a ten minute lightning talk on blockchain technology and it's potential applications at the HTML5 Denver Meetup.
