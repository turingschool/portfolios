Ruby Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
Completion and Progress
3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There was an "aha" moment in the middle of both projects where it struck me what I was actually building. That's fun, and it was worth struggling through the initial confusion to hit that moment of clarity. I will admit my attention to "style" when developing solo is not as acute as I (and future employers) would hope. I hope to work on enhancing my style through exercisms over mid-mod break. 

#### Date Night

https://github.com/njgheorghita/date_night
https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Info
  Create a binary search tree for a collection of movie titles and their score. Develop methods to interact with data structure; insert, include?, depth_of, max, min, sort, load, health. Didn't have time to complete health method implementation.
  
Notes
  - Started a bit late because I was waiting for the TDD class
  - 18 test all pass
  - Pretty good test progression
  - Fill out the naming of tests, variables, etc
  - Implementation has room for refactoring but is effective
  
Score
  TDD - 3
  Functional Expectations - 2
  Breaking Logic into Components - 3
  Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3
  
### HTTP

https://github.com/njgheorghita/http
https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

Info
  Create a local server. Use your browser / postman to interact with your server. Server has functions including a 'hello world' page, a datetime page, a shutdown page.  Include a word search element with which you can interact through the url. Implement a number guessing game with which you can interact with through a post request. 
  
Notes
  - 29 tests - all passing - used faraday
  - the http class was all a long file no methods or classes
  - talked about taking some classes out of other classes. nested classes
  
Score
  TDD - 3
  Functional Expectations - 3
  Breaking Logic into Components - 2
  Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2.5
  
## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both of my pair projects were lovely experiences. Working with a partner definitely forces me to focus on style. Whereas on solo-projects, I get easily distracted by focusing on functionality. It's more enjoyable writing code with others. Even though it might not be as speedy as going alone, you end up with undoubtedly better ideas. Especially if you're able to get in a "flow" while pairing, it can transfrom a messy project into beautiful code. 

#### Complete Me
  https://github.com/njgheorghita/complete_me
  https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown
  
Info
  Tested, designed, and built a trie data structure that stores all the words in the usr dictionary. 
    - Suggests likely words based on given sub-string
    - Inserts custom words into trie structure
    - Delectes given words from trie structure
    - Weighs selected words favorably for returned suggestions
    - Used Shoes to build a gui
    
Notes
  - About 35 tests across files
  - Need to use the spec harness
  - Three part implementation is good
  - Good tests on node and whole CompleteMe
  - Trie is mostly tested through CompleteMe
  - Would like to see a bit more abstraction in the implementation
  - Spec harness: passes
  - Built a shoes GUI
  
Score
  TDD - 3
  Encapsulation - 3
  Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3
  Enumerable & Collections - 3
  Functional Expectations - 4
  
#### Black Thursday
  https://github.com/wlffann/black_thursday
  https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown 
  
Info
  Developed a ruby program that parses e-commerce data to provide actionable business intelligence. It was riveting to watch a mess of csv files turn into real people and transactions, that we could then analyze. This project was especially useful for learning the importance of organization, style, and passing self references throughout the system. For an extension, we got into D3.js, which was tricky at first, but very satisfying once we got our data to fit the javascript. 
  
Notes
  - 178 tests, 189 assertions all passing
  - Really nice job.
  - Used a delegator which was creative
  - Broke logic out very well.
  
Score
  Functional Expectations - 4
  TDD - 4
  Encapsulation - 4
  Ruby & Style - 3
  Enumerable & Collections - 4
  Code Sanitation - 4
  
## D: Professional Skills

I'm very pleased that Turing places such an emphasis on soft skills. While some of the individual topics might have been hit or miss, the overall effort was a huge hit and will go on to serve me well throughout my career. 

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown

Well, in retrospect this gearup was helpful in reinforcing my political bias while remaining oblivious to the obvious pain and distress that remains the experience for a majority of this country. My notes from this session all feel a little ridiculous now. I went out, supported my candidate, and lost. Which is an interesting experience. Especially when the alternative choice is exceptionally distasteful. But, such is democracy. 

A big takeaway from this session was that Trump has motivated me to become more politically engaged. After his victory, the question remains the same but on a grander scale. Do I feel a drive to remain in this country, fight for what I believe in? As a dual citizen, I don't feel any particularly strong allegience to her constitution. But, it would sure be regretful to watch her wither and die. 

#### Introversion
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

This was my favorite gear-up. The topic is very interesting. But even more so, I enjoyed the group conversation from this session. A lot of the argument centered around whether this dichotomy of introvert/extrovert is a valid reality or if it's just new-age broo-ha-ha. From my personal experience, I believe there is some validity to the introvert/extrovert theory. Though, after the discussion, I agree that a lot of the conclusions derived from this hypothesis are misguided. 


#### Resilience
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown

Resilience. A trait fundamental to success. But the gravity and significance of this concept is easily lost in conversation. Resilience should be practiced, not preached. Blog posts from 20-something year old white male talking about his ability to persevere through a rainy day did little to inspire emotion or conversation. The scientific research did little but make me mourn the lack of quality education throughout socio-economic strata.

Maybe, I'm wrong. Maybe somebody else, not so familiar with the concept, found a deeper understanding of their life and mission throughout the session. Maybe other groups had a profound discussion on the essence of resilience. I hope so. But my impresssion was that the average Turing-er is very familiar with resilience, feels little need to share their reasons for being resilient, and would rather spend that time in spikes. Or it could just be me. 


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md
https://resume.creddle.io/resume/g2s7dabwads
www.linkedin.com/in/njgheorghita
www.github.com/njgheorghita

Obvs. This is huge for finding the job you want. I'm happy that Turing makes us think about this from the time we step in the door. While Mod-1 has been a little crazy, I'm excited to step up my personal branding game over the mid-mod break. 

#### StrengthsFinder

Our StrengthsFinder session was enjoyable. It's always interesting to have intimate conversations with others on their personality / strengths and how it impacts them & those around them. The questions we were asked to consider were confusing. I think we could have had an impactful conversation on the topic of strengths without the process of whiteboarding challenges we face and then asserting why they arent challenges even though they really are challenges. 

#### Feedback

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md

I understand the importance of feedback. I place a high value on negative feedback (delivered nicely). But the process of giving and receiving honest feedback is still muddled by social constraints. This makes it difficult to both deliver the feedback you want to give, and validate the feedback that you receive. 

#### Learning To Pair

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q5F5tmlT4mkO0JdqqU0Ahs9plPnyAVXuLNIoEPEQyxQ/edit?usp=sharing

DTR's are crucial. It's so valuable to have a dedicated time to honestly strategize how to maximize the partnership. Getting this information in writing helps to establish norms, whih minimizes the unpleasantness of mis-matched expectations. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Mike Schutte - 
  His name is Mike. His enthusiasm is contagious, and oh so valuable when you’ve been sitting in a basement, staring at screens for hours. Not to mention, unbounded willingness to stop his task and help with any code problems, or just to talk about our mutual admiration for the tequila-rista across the road. It’s been a pleasure learning and writing code in his company. I will undoubtedly be recounting wild and crazy stories about this man and his proclivity for the finer things in life to my great-great-grandchildren.
  
Eric Wahlgren-Sauro
  Eric is a super dude. His willingness to help out the newbies and help us feel comfortable was huge coming into a new environment. I still have my computer set up the same way he showed me in the first week of class. He’s always willing to sit down, help with your code or just chat about everything from machine learning, to societal structures, to babes. I might as well name him godfather to my children now. Looking forward to next mod with you. #Armstrong4lyfe

Josh Cohen - 
  1. Take more time to explain. Convey high-level concepts better.
   Focus less on the outcome and more on the process. 
   Your partner doesn't learn by being talked to, 
   they learn by doing with. 
   
  2. I didn't express feelings strongly, my personality/work mode is felixble enough
   where I adapt easily. I can see a situation where that's not the case.
   Partner might feel like you're leaving them behind.

  3. Headstrong.

  4. Take extra time & specific focus to go through the learning stages together,
   make sure both partners are on the same page.

### Being a Community Member

Eric Wahlgren-Sauro -
  Nick and I connected after school one day when the cohort went out drinking. He is easygoing and seems like someone I'd love to work with. He's enjoyable to have in the Armstrong cohort. I loved his willingness to jump in and lead a session on APIs while Jean was out one Friday. I thought it was brave.

Amara Lovato - 
  Nick has a friendly and positive attitude all the time and people like help to make any stressful moment better. He provides a very good vibe for our group and he is always ready to help and give nice encouraging words. I'm glad that he is our cohort, he is a very nice person to interact with and a good team member.
  
Mike Schutte - 
  I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you this mod. You are super good problem solver, and always quick to help others who need it. If I had to guess, I’d say so many people come to you for help because of your calm demeanor, which makes the material a little less intense. Looking forward to Mod 2!
  
  
### Playing a Part

I was an active member of the Armstrong posse. I thoroughly enjoyed each session I could attend. Ethan and I led the spike session one week when the leaders couldn't make it. In that session we played with the Alchemy API, and I took that a little further to develop a sentiment analysis of the top 3 songs every year since 1940. (styling still needs a little tidying up)
