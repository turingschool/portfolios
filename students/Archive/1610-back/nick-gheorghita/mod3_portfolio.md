## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

- Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
    - it’s going to lead to a stratified workplace, where a people like them inhabit their world, and people unlike them are excluded from their world
- Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
    - the point that small biases have large affects, therefore small anti-biases can have a large impact is poignant, and for that reason i think it’s good to have regimented diversity quotas
- Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
    - keeping a small anti-bias
- PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
    - turing emphasizing diversity is important, even if not stated explicitly being surrounded, and learning in a diverse environment is going to make such an environment feel natural, and when we enter the workforce we’ll continue to seek / create a similar environment
- PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?
    - versus being talked to / reading a detailed research paper, it visualizes the problem and illustrates very clearly how small biases can create large divides

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

- This was my favorite gear-up to date @ Turing. The topic was interesting, current, and significant. 
- The discussions that arose from these readings/videos were also the most interesting to date.
- I'm pretty excited to watch, and play a role in (BLOCKCHAINS!) mitigating the unwanted consequences of automation.

- How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire?
    - Incredibly serious, it might not happen suddenly, but overtime a majority of jobs are gone. 
- Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes?
    - I’ll be lucky enough to be in a position where at least i can work my way around automation, and hopefully distribute the wealth that automation will generate
- What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue?
    - Trickle-down economics is a harmful myth with serious economic consequences and should be put to rest once and for all. 
    - Come up with blockchain solutions!
- What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?
    - Talk about it, have this same gearup every couple of mods. 

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

- How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?
    - not enough jobs for people, political shittiness, the opportunity to free up people from unnecessary labor to pursue passions that inspire them without worrying about food/rent
- What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?
    - i’d agree, while i’m not sold that it’s the best response to automation, it’s the most realistic solution for decreasing income inequality
- Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?
    - b/c all the jobs that people want to bring back to america aren’t really being shipped overseas, they’re being automated, and capitalism is a pretty unstoppable force so there’s not gonna be a stop to this automation trend
- Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?
    - contact your senator!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

to Brett Rivers: 
  Yo Brett. It was really enjoyable working on this project with you. I know we didn’t have a lot of 1-1 interaction, 
but I still appreciated how easy you were to work with. You took on all challenges with gumption, and weren’t shy 
about reaching out for help when you hit a wall. You know yourself well, and how you get your best work accomplished 
and are upfront about it. Super. You’re always sharing new ideas and tools you’ve unearthed. Can’t wait for the day 
the FBI kicks down your door. JK, I know you use tails.

to Jesse Shipley: 
  Yo Jesse. Super glad we were able to work on a project together. You’ve got quite a talent for diving into new topics, 
and knocking them down cold. It’s almost a fun game to give you a new gem, and then wait how long before you know just 
about everything there is to know (hint. it’s not a very long wait). Your personality is always light and friendly. 
I really appreciate that, as it makes for quite the tension-snapper whenever database design discussions might get a 
little heated. And your giphy game is on point!

to Mike Schutte: 
  Mr. Schutte! It was a pleasure finally working on a project together. Can’t say enough about how great you are as a 
team member, and your skills as a coder. But, I’ll try. Even though we dumped the responsibility of PM on you, you 
took it on and murdered it with ease. The fact that our project came together while we were all working on separate 
features comes down largely to how well you did this job. I’m in constant awe of your refactoring skills, it’s something 
that’s gonna take you far in your career. Your people skills are also on point. Always with the high and positive energy,
even when we’re bogged down in the muddy trenches, under constant siege from ugly and boring stories, you pop in like a 
whiff of fresh air on a dewy, spring morning.

to Nick Erhardt:
  Yo Nick. Super happy I was able to work on this project with you. If I could, I’d have you on every project. It’s 
incredibly helpful to have somebody who is as thorough as you are, to cross the t’s, dot the i’s, thinking through 
the robustness of tests, and think of those tricky edge cases that might have been overlooked. Pretty awesome. 
Plus, your git game is on fire. I appreciate all the effort you put into the prs. And, I was really impressed with 
your ability to understand and implement pretty crazy features with ease. It’s massive. Whoop!


### Being a Community Member

from Mike Schutte:
  My main hacker! Nick, you are a fundamentally fun person to be around. Somehow, you strike a great balance 
between a focused and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Technically, I am incredibly impressed by your ability to 
solve almost any bug or problem. One downside to this, in my opinion, can be sloppy or cryptic code that is 
hard to read and build off. Overall, thank you for your outstanding contributions (esp. AJAX and GoogleMaps) 
that took the project to the next level. Good luck on your future work!

from Jesse Shipley: 
  Every new project seems like there are no new pair possibilies left, and still I have never worked with you.
So finally glad we got to work together on a pretty large scale project, and had an outstanding time with it.
I honestly have no Deltas for you to work on with this project. You saved me in the end with clutch re-ordering
of my JS scripts! You were always willing to help any of us, and always kept in contact with things you may
have been troubling you. Your communication with the group was awesome, as well as your even demeanor throughout
the whole time. The extra humor on top of an already fun group to work with made these 2 weeks pass by quick.
Really want to thank you again for all your extra help, staying up super late for our Git Merge party and adding
a fresh pair of eyes to those damn Google Maps scripts.

from Nick Erhardt:
  I think that was the rallying cry of our group for about a week and a half.
Everything that you tackled on this project was a great big unknown.  We
had never worked with calendars before, or maps, or jQuery, or .... you get
the idea.  And each time you would say, "Oh, I'll take a look at that," and
then it would simply be done.  You always found a way to shoehorn in new
technology, in a way that worked, and looked good.  And your response
afterward was always the same, "It wasn't that bad to figure out." 
What??
No man, it was hard.  You just made it look easy.
Well, I'm glad you were on my team for this group.  You always came
through.  And you worked hard even when you sounded like death.  
My one delta for you would be: share all the cool stuff you learned.  It
was no small feat that you made the available nights appear as a different
color on the jQuery calendar.  That was awesome and not simple.  But, as
your teammate, it would have been helpful to hear a little about the
process, or maybe how you would do it next time if you needed to do that
again.
