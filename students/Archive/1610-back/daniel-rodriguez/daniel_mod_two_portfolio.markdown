# Daniel Rodriguez - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

From what I've heard from other students module 2 consists of larger projects that require more group work. I plan make my ability to work well in larger groups my main area of emphasis during these next six weeks. From getting more comfortable with Github, communicating in person or remotely, or helping others whenever they get stuck I want to make sure that I can carry my weight whenever we are assigned group projects.

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

#### 2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

#### 3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

#### 4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

#### 5. Rails Style

 * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

#### 6. Testing

 * 4: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently

#### 7. Collaboration

 * 3.5: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
 * 3.5: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Job Tracker

* Github Repo: https://github.com/drod1000/job-tracker
* Description: Rails app that keeps track of jobs

#### 1. Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

#### 2. Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

#### 3. Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

#### 4. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

#### 5. Views

* 3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

#### 6. User Experience

* 3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.

#### 7. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Bike Share

* Github Repo: https://github.com/drod1000/bike-share
* Description: Sinatra app that uses Ruby and ActiveRecord to analyze bike share usage in San Francisco

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3.5: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* 3.5: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

#### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

#### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

#### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md

As a Hispanic male born to Mexican immigrants, I've encountered situations that can be categorized as microagressions. Although it's hard for me to not get angry when people make offensive statements, I've learned that no good comes from it. In the future, I plan to give them the benefit of the doubt and try to make them aware of what their statements are implying. The best way I can help is by not staying silent whenever these slights are made while remaining respectful.

#### Journey Mapping

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown

This Gear Up introduced us to how mapping an end user's journey helps us develop software that better suits their needs. As a developer, it's important for me to put myself in other people's shoes rather than just viewing everything from my point of view.

#### Grit

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

Although I don't agree with the Angela Duckworth's definition of grit, I do agree that it plays a role in an individual's ability to reach goals and overcome obstacles. I've always thought of myself as a gritty person and I believe that it's helped me overcome difficult situations in the past. As I head into what most students say is the toughest module I plan to rely on grit whenever I encounter situations that plant seeds of doubt in my head.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Finding Opportunities

* Deliverable: https://trello.com/b/wSFGFUAZ/job-tracker-daniel-rodriguez

This workshop was an eye opening experience for me. I was made aware that about 75 % of positions are never made available online. I realized that great jobs don't just fall from the sky and that I'm going to have to make opportunities for myself or be forced to settle. As an introvert it's hard for me to put myself out there, but I've realized that I have to do it if I'm going to find a job that I love.

#### Intro to Project Management

Being introduced to Agile vs Waterfall development early in the module ended up being really helpful when I worked on Bike Share and Little Shop with my groups. As project manager, I tried to split up and prioritize tasks so that we'd be able to practice agile development even if there were parts that depended on each other. During both projects, my team was able to keep working independently and we rarely had anyone sitting around waiting for another person to finish a feature. This helped us finish the project early and granted us enough time to refactor to the best of our ability and to style so that everything ended up looking great.

#### Cold Outreach

* Deliverable: List of sent emails sent to Meg

To be honest, reaching out to complete strangers is rather terrifying for me. Although it seems like it might be a little early to start working on this I know this will prepare me as the time to look for a job gets closer. A big takeaway from this, is that although I'm trying to build a professional network it's important to keep things casual so that people don't feel like I'm just using them to try to get a job.

#### Feedback II

Paragraph reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process

I really enjoyed the Johari Window exercise that Allison had us do for this workship. It allowed me to get some insight in to how others perceive me even when I don't think of myself that way. I was surprised at the number of adjectives related to friendliness and kindess used by my team members to describe me. I plan to keep trying to do the things that I've done well and improve on those that could use some work.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Brett:

 I really enjoyed working on Bike Share with Brett. This was the first time working with someone who lives out of town and I was a little nervous . Brett's ability to collaborate remotely and his overall knowledge of Github has helped in improving my workflow. I would've liked to have taken more time as a group to plan out the project before splitting up but that's all I can think of.
 
#### Drew:

Drew is a great person to work with. He always knows the right time to crack a joke whenever the group is starting to get flustered due to a difficult problem. He’s always willing to do whatever it takes for the team to be successful. He has a thorough understanding of most concepts which gives him the ability to fill in the gaps wherever the team needs him. He can explain what he’s thinking when he has a better understanding of something and he’s not afraid to speak up when he thinks we’re going down the wrong path. Having said all of this, I would encourage him to practice styling. There was a point during the project when we were paired together to style and we ended up wasting time and a not so good looking page.

#### Robbie:

I believe that Robbie is a very talented developer who will only continue to get better. He’s one of the hardest workers in our cohort. His ability to find creative solutions, whether it’s using a Gem we’ve never heard of in class or utilizing Structs to finish up a tricky method is very impressive. I’d be very happy to work with him again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

#### Brett:

Working with you for bike share was great.  I really enjoyed how you helped me with understanding the database structure.  Remember to speak up! Both, in volume, and when you have an idea!

#### Drew:

Daniel did an excellent job as Project Manager. He made sure every card we were given was completed, he was fair, he trusted the team, he's smart, and is a wonderful coder. Daniel was always available for communication and did a really good job of organizing waffle cards and getting the group together for meetings. I would be honored to work with Daniel again on a project. I challenge Daniel to speak his voice more often. I think he is incredibly intelligent, and I know for a fact he has really good ideas. He is also very quiet. Speak up, Daniel! Your ideas rock. Also, like me, practice your styling.

#### Robbie:

I really enjoyed working with Dan during the bike share project. He is a strong, hard worker, with a lot of really good ideas. It is also nice that he is accepting and open to discussing ideas. His attitude promotes a healthy environment. I really look forward to working with Dan and having more conversations with him.

### Playing a Part

I am to bring my best self day in and day out so that I can influence those around me in a positive way. I try to make myself available for pairings as often as I possibly can and I try to offer help whenever I see that others are struggling. Towards the end of the module, a couple of other students and myself started reaching out to students who consider themselves a person of color. We got more enthusiasm than we were expecting and hope to keep this momentum going as we enter the next module. My hope is that we'll build a stronger community within Turing and that we can start reaching out to the community to inspire more people from different backgrounds to become developers.
