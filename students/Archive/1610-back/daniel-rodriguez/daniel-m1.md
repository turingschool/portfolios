# Daniel Rodriguez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

When I first started at Turing my goal was to familiarize myself with Ruby and get used to thinking through problems logically to give myself a good foundation as a new developer. As the module progressed, I realized that that there are a lot of things that go into writing good and readable code that I wasn't aware of initially. I struggled with using a test driven development approach at first so I made it a point to improve on it. Although I know I still have a way to go I'm proud of the strides I've made and hope to turn this into a strength of mine as I move through the program.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects that I worked on during Module 1 (Date Night and HTTP) are listed below:

### Date Night

Repo: https://github.com/drod1000/Date-Night

Date Night stores movies according to their score by using a binary search tree

Notes:

* 15 tests all pass
* Tests are strong with some gaps for better progression / edge cases / simple cases
* Implementation is good, doesn't quite feel like native Ruby
* Overall a strong project

Scores:

#### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### HTTP

Repo: https://github.com/drod1000/http

HTTP builds a functioning web server

Scores:

#### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## C: Group Work & Projects

The two pair projects that I worked on during Module 1 (Nightwriter and Black Thursday) are listed below:

### Nightwriter

Repo: https://github.com/Sh1pley/nightwriter

Nightwriter converts text files from english to braille and back

Notes:

* Able to convert to braille to english and vice versa
* File IO has too much logic in it, would have liked to seen the logic broken out into translator or wherever it would have made the most sense
* A few classes in translator class have a lot of room to break out into smaller methods
* Discussed using constants in the future, but liked that it was at least broken out into its own class

Scores:

#### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

#### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

#### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### Black Thursday

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/drod1000/black_thursday

Black Thursday builds a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business

Notes:
* Beautiful testing suite, nice balance of integration and unit testing
* Went a little overboard on assertions; only need one to target claim, split into separate tests if targeting different cases
* Consistent implementation of best-choice enumerables
* Complete through i4
* 0 rake sanitation errors
* Use of one module (SAAssistant) and Merchant Analyst class to delegate functionality and uphold SRP

Scores:

#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation
* The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
* 4: Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

I'm usually confident in my ability to pick things up from a technical perspective but I've always felt a little shakier when it comes to soft skills. I've found the Gear Up sessions and the professional development workshops really helpful. All of the sessions that I attended during Module 1 are listed below.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

Markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown

It is my duty as a citizen of the U.S. to vote and make sure that I am informed when I do so. It's important to consider all reputable sources when researching to ensure that I have the complete picture. Moving forward, I plan to consider the viewpoints of those who disagree with me instead of dismissing them. It's easy to accepts others when they feel the way you do but the only way we can move forward is to attempt to understand those who are not like us.

#### Introversion

Markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown

As an introvert who has always struggled to fit in, the thought that the world is designed in a way that favors extroverts has crossed my mind before. I've learned to use it as an asset instead of viewing it as a hindrance. I try to leverage the strengths that come with it whenever I interact with others. I also try to make a concerted effort to accommodate others to ensure that everyone feels comfortable no matter their level of extraversion.

#### Resilience

Markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown

In all honesty, I hadn't given a lot of thought to resiliency before this gear up session. Once I reflected on it, I realized that it helped me overcome many of the obstatcles that I encountered growing up in an underpriviledged community. I think that it's important to develop resilience as an individual because no matter where you come from at some point you're going to be faced with adversity and how you respond will determine whether you can overcome it.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jesse Shipley:

Jesse was my partner for our first paired project, Nightwriter. I was a little nervous about working on a project with another person for the first time but I’m happy to say that working with Jesse was a great experience. In our DTR session we talked about our strengths and weaknesses and how we planned to approach the project. We kept an open line of communication as we were working through it which was vital to us turning in a product that we were proud of. Throughout the project Jesse demonstrated that he is a creative problem solver, a hard worker who never gives up, and someone who is always looking for ways to improve. I’m sure that he will keep doing great at Turing and I look forward to working with him again in the future.

To Marisa Burton:

Marisa was my partner for Black Friday. The two weeks we spent working on this project were both challenging and rewarding. We had a lot of moments where we struggled to move forward due to the size of the project but Marisa’s calming influence and ability to push both of us to keep going kept us on schedule. Whenever we worked side by side we were able to get into a great flow due in large part to her willingness to stop us whenever my instincts to try anything until something worked took over. Marisa knows a lot more than she thinks she does. I’ve learned a lot from working beside her and I would be happy to work with her again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

From Jesse Shipley:

Daniel was my first partner in paired coding. During the DTR we both openly discussed what we enjoyed about code, and the ways we thought we understood each step following with the things we thought we struggled with. Daniel's technical ability with Ruby was integral to forming the framework of our project. He was able to flawlessy take my mechanical/logical ideas and teach me how to implement them into code. The pairing with Daniel was the bar to reach for every pairing I have had since, both with fellow 1610 students and other mod students as well. I could not have hand selected a better partner to learn along side during our early weeks at school. His input and constructive criticism were greatly appreciated, and I am certain pairing with him helped me grasp some important fundamentals in Ruby and coding in general.

From Marisa Burton:

Daniel was a great partner. He is a strong programmer and led the way through stressful and tough coding moments. He has strong organizational and logical skills. He is a hard worker who doesn't stop coding until he thinks it's the best, refactored code he can possibly write at the given moment. He always explained his thought processes really well, and I learned a lot from him by working with him on Black Thursday and would be happy to work with him again.

### Playing a Part

I tried my best to support Turing's mission by attending events and making sure to be an active participant during Gear Up sessions. Module 1 was extremely challenging for me and I found myself having to focus most of my time on coding. I definitely think I could've done a better job and I plan to do so in the upcoming modules.
