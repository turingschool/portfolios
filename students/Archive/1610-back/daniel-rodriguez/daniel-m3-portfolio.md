# Daniel Rodriguez - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Building and consuming APIs will be my biggest focus throughout this module since I have a lot of ideas that I would like to implement as side projects. Also, I feel like I really neglected styling during Mod 2 so I'll be focused on that during my individual and group projects.

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.

### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Keep Up

* Github URL: https://github.com/drod1000/keep-up
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module3/projects/self_directed_project.md

Keep Up is my self directed projected and the most challenging/fun I've had working on one. The app has the user enter the url to an article and then it gets converted to an audio file that they can listen to like they would a podcast. Although I didn't write a crazy amount of code this project really challenged me on a conceptual level. I used an article extraction API(Aylien), AWS(Amazon Polly and S3), and Redis for the background workers. Most importantly, I learned that I've gained the ability to take a project from an idea into an app that I'm proud of.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown

I really enjoyed this Gear Up because of how it illustrated how a lot of individuals making personal decisions with no regard for the bigger picture can result in a system that is biased. One of the biggest takeaways from this session for me is that I have to actively pursue change instead of just standing by doing nothing. Moving forward, I plan to try to think of the impact that my actions might have on those around me and do my part to ensure that any negative repercussions are dealt with.

#### Automation and the Future

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown

As a software developer, I think it's important to be aware of the effects that automation has on the rest of the population.  The tech community has to avoid living inside their bubble and pay attention to and have empathy for the people might lose their jobs due to technology. Although technology has helped us make a lof of progress, thinking about all of the people that are in danger of losing their only way of making money makes me anxious because I feel that most people don't really care until it ends up happening to them.

#### Universal Basic Income

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown

I wasn't able to attend this session but I think that UBI is one of the best ideas being floated around as a way to combat the negative effecs of automation. I think it's a viable strategy as long as it's framed and implemented correctly. For it to work we have to keep in mind the possible effects that it'll have on our economy and how companies might react to it. For example, we have to account for the fact that greedy companies will probably try to use it to their advantage to increase the cost of basic living expenses and ensure that things like that don't happen because it defeats the purpose of UBI.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md
* Deliverable: https://gist.github.com/drod1000/ebf34a682207deb0ead10a9d609cceae

#### Organize Your Shit

* Github URL: http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_four/organize_your_shit

Although this session left me feeling a little nervious about the upcoming job search, I really appreciated Jeff's honesty and direct approach. I'd rather be shocked now than 3 months after I've graduated with no job in sight. My biggest takeaway from this session is that although Turing has done everything in its power to prepare me to land a job it's ultimately my responsibility. Once I start applying to jobs it's important to be organized and methodical in my approach to make sure I'm actually making progress instead of just feeling like I'm doing a lot but not getting any closer to a job.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

* Github URL: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md
* Deliverable: https://gist.github.com/drod1000/82b94419801927aff9d1551f0889ae98

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Drew:

As expected, working with Drew again was a pleasure. He’s a great person to pair with, a hard worker and a very talented developer who will only continue to get better. I would encourage him to take risks and to take ownership of features to push himself as a developer.

#### Jason:

I had a great time working with Jason. He’s a hard worker and he has the confidence to take on the most challenging features. I really appreciated him taking ownership of the Twilio 2 Factor Authentication and styling our splash page which ended up looking awesome thanks to him. For constructive feedback, I would encourage him to break branches into smaller pieces to make more frequent PRs. There were two that had a lot of changes across the application and it took a while for everyone to get through them.

#### Kyle:

I really enjoyed working with Kyle on Cloney Island. Thank you for taking the time to carefully review PRs, make suggestions, and explain your thought process. Although we only paired once, I was able to pick up a lot of useful techniques from your workflow. I really admire the time and effort that you put into refactoring every line of code, even tests. My only piece of constructive feedback is to make sure to speak up whenever you think there might be a better approach. You have great ideas and the whole team benefits from hearing them.

### Being a Community Member

#### Drew:

Feedback: I thoroughly enjoy working with Daniel. He's a very smart individual with a good attitude, and great ideas. His coding abilities are top notch. I would be happy to work with him again.

Constructive Feedback: Sometimes Daniel can be hard to get a hold of. I would encourage him to be more tenacious in responding to emails/github tags/slack messages so that the team can take care of issues faster.

#### Jason:

Feedback: I had the pleasure of working with Daniel on Cloney Island. He was a great teammate. He  was always willing to pair. He was a great help when I ran into issues (And has been outside of this project as well). He showed a tremendous work ethic throughout this project.

Constructive Feedback: Overall Daniel was a pleasure to work with, the only thing I would say from a constructive feedback standpoint is that on a few occasions once we weren’t at school he was a little difficult to get in contact with.

#### Kyle:

It was great to work with Daniel on Cloney Island. You do an awesome job of keeping the big picture in mind and anticipating how the architecture will work a few steps down the road. You are also great to pair with and I definitely enjoyed the time we got to spend pairing together. My only constructive feedback is to keep the git workflow and branches tidy to make smaller, more frequent PRs.

### Playing a Part

As I've progressed through the program I've realized that the fact that I'm a Latino in the tech industry means that I can't afford to stay quiet whenever sensitive topics come up. I've made a concerted effort to voice my opinion and offer my perspective whether I'm at a Gear Up or just grabbing some food with individuals in my cohort. I've also paired with a couple of students from Turing Diversity in the lower mods whenever they're struggling with a difficult concept. I wish I could have done more this mod, but I found myself really busy most of the time with all of the work.
