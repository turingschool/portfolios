# Jesse Shipley - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My initial thoughts and goals when coming to Turing were to attain a firm grasp on coding methods, ideas and practical application.
After week one, I shifted focus to becoming the most focused and most 'present' self I could possibly be. I began to set aside time
for pairs to ask questions. These were questions of my own, and also questions that a neighboring student might have spoken and I only had 
a basic grasp on the concept but offered a brief explanation to help. I wanted to be the best possible student I could be, and also be the
best possible member of the cohort I could. After week 4 it became clear that being the best I could, on a whole person level, was
key to surviving the stress, tight schedules and awkard 'I dont know' experiences that Turing could and would throw at a person. I made,
and maintained friendships and working relationships that could be called on for anything from lunch, to why won't this code run. For that
I am grateful of my early shift in focus.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/projects/tree/master/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

First project of meaning in any code language. This was a produce of struggling and man handling Ruby code to do as I bid. 
We were tasked with making a working Mastermind game in Ruby as our first graded project. Over the week each new concept taught built on the last.
Also I began to recognize that each time I would research a solution to a current problem, it would usually be taught the next class session. This project
began my exploration and curiousity in building methods that would call on methods, and really exposed my lack of knowledge in TDD. 

#### Notes:
Assessed By: Ilana

9 tests - all passing
Talked about seperation of responsibility - maybe an outputmessages class etc.
breaking down methods a little further
testing on a smaller unit level basis
keep an eye out for instance variables and usage
### Score:

#### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

#### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
* 2.5: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay - some missing features

#### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2.5: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has high usuage of instance variables, needs refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
------------
### 99 Bottles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/99_bottles)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/99_bottles.markdown)

Week 4 was the side shuffle into the focus group. Beth, Ilana, and Sally wanted to reaffirm that some of us in the cohort were heading in the right direction. I appreciated this because it allowed some more strict guidelines and quick
single project turn arounds. After being assigned 99 bottles, and finding it on the relatively easier side. I wanted to grab the attention of both Beth and Ilana, I wanted to be challenged and felt that maybe there was a mixup in assessing my abilities.
After this project was turned in and checked with Ilana, Jason and I were put into the middle group, and were assigned Enigma.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/nightwriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

My pair Daniel and I were tasked with implementing a program that could take a message in text format and convert it to a digital form of braille.


#### Notes:
Assessed By: Sally MacNicholas

Able to convert to braille to english and vice versa
File IO has too much logic in it, would have liked to seen the logic broken out into translator or wherever it would have made the most sense.
A few classes in translator class have a lot of room to break out into smaller methods
Discussed using constants in the future, but liked that it was at least broken out into its own class

#### Scores:

#### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 2. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

#### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

#### 4. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### Feedback:
Daniel Rodriguez:
Jesse was my partner for our first paired project, Nightwriter. I was a little nervous about working on a project with another person for the first time but I’m happy to say that working with Jesse was a great experience. In our DTR session we talked about our strengths and weaknesses and how we planned to approach the project. We kept an open line of communication as we were working through it which was vital to us turning in a product that we were proud of. Throughout the project Jesse demonstrated that he is a creative problem solver, a hard worker who never gives up, and someone who is always looking for ways to improve. I’m sure that he will keep doing great at Turing and I look forward to working with him again in the future.

### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

#### Notes:

This was a short notice project that was done by Jason Conrad and I. Our Cohort was so large that we broke off into 2 seperate classes in what was known as the "Best Kept Secret" class.
This class for Jason and I was to realign our thoughts on Object Oriented Programming. The project given was Enigma, which is a spin on the Enigma machine and encrypter used in WWII. 
Although this was a paired project, the time frame alloted (2 days) was better spent in a divide and conquer situation. We white boarded together and split up the methods and leg work. In the end we came together with smart methods, 
that demonstrated how creative you could get with logic in programming. This was the project that really allowed me to put logic and mechanical though into actual object oriented code. It was rewarding to see classes talked
to each other, interact and affect one another. This principle also lent itself well to our follow on project Black Thursday.

### Feedback:
Jason Conrad:
During the “Best Kept Secret Week” Jesse and I worked on the Enigma 
project together. He displayed a great understanding of what it was 
we were trying to do and how it was that we needed to go about doing
it.
Even Jesse had limited ability to stay at school he made it a point
that if he was at home he was still deep into the project working 
things out. We both agreed to make it a point to break things down 
as small as we could and to make testing a priority which was a 
great help to me as that was one of the things I really want to 
focus on.
I am very happy with the end result as a project I wasn’t able to 
finish the first time around mod 1 in about a week Jesse and I 
finished in about 2 days. I know there is no way we could’ve done 
it without Jesse’s dedication and work ethic. I would be more than
happy to work with Jesse again.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

#### Notes:
Assessed By: Ilana 

Notes:
- 131 tests / 191 assertions all passing

#### Scores:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints


### Feedback:
Ethan Bennet:
We both had personal stuff going on, and we still managed to complete the project without too much stress. I think a big part of that came from your independent working style and your patient demeanor, and those qualities made collaboration easy. It seemed like you were committed to doing the best possible work from start to finish, and your catching the Iteration 0 mistake early caused the rest of the project to flow smoothly. You were also extremely good at solving the frustrating problems without wanting to throw your computer through the wall, and I don't think this project would've turned out as well paired with most anyone else. It was great working with you!

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [Vote Your Conscience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This was my into to gear up. It was a very involved topic, and I couldnt have asked for better company than my lunch roulette group.
We dove in head first, it was refreshing to see so many differing views on topics that are so ever-present and 
potentially life altering. The mix of emotions, take aways and opinions was amazing. This set me up for so much 
excitement and longing for each new lunch roulette group/gear-up.

#### Introversion

* [Introversion and Extroversion on Teams](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

Second gear up! Turing School really showed off its adaptability. Our topic was introversion/extroversion, after the video my initial take away
was that I alligned pretty darn well in the middle of the pack, and thought myself lucky. But could also recognize the influence of each side to better
understand the people around me. We discussed this in groups, and delved deeper into the topics. We had members from each side of the intro/extrovert spectrum
present and the video was a great gateway into an otherwise tough topic to breach. Going forward I would like to set a personal goal of proactively alligning my
actions and thoughts to better accomodate all in a group.

#### Resilience

* [Resilience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up was great. It was over an article I had read previously and thought was interesting. In addition to the original artical I read, it
offered a rebuttle that poked holes but also left some holes in itself. The conflicting articles were a great
jumping off point, our group grabbed a table and initially just sat down and talked to build report. We read, and began discussing.
It was very interesting to hear the different stories of personal resiliency, also very enlightening and build a better relationships
between us that makes us now seem alot more than the strangers we were 20 minutes prior to that. 

My biggest take away was Vido, he shared a very empowering story. Ending it with a personal mantra that I believe we could all use, I know I will.
Paraphrasing but keeping the context. Vido shared his insight about facing what seems like an impossible situation, with the mantra "I am here because
of my own choices and I am lucky to be having this problem."

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding I

* [Personal Branding](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/43vy77vvu9z)
* [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-shipley)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/Sh1pley)

Session was very informative! My big take aways were what to include and not include on resumes. Also how to wrap my non software skills and military experience into statements and information that works.

#### Learning to Pair

* [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

This session was important to building a strong foundation on how to convey information in pairs, how to handle divided work loads. This also gave some tips on making technology work in our favor and in a way to supports collaboration and team work.

#### Feedback I

* [Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

This may have been the most important profession development session. Knowing how to correctly give thanks is huge in an industry that has so many deep roots in solo work. Learning a broader foundation for
feedback, hopefully pushes us all as a class and an industry to open up our work flows a processes to groups and pair work. Collaboration is very important to avoid stagnation, 
this lecture helped cultivate good relationships, and ways to effectively give constructive criticisms.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Drew Palazzari:
Drew was one of the first classmates I met and talked to at Turing. We initially connected through football, those conversation were effectively the prelude to late night code fumbling and idea tossing through Slack, Lunch, Tomato breaks.. etc. We started and completed the DTR before we knew or were taught how and it is one of the best community/social interactions I have had, not only at Turing but before attending as well. He has stayed late to help, given advice and trusted me enough to ask for advice as well. I look forward to continuing on through Turing along side Drew. His attitude towards learning, the curriculum and the Turing culture has made my time here more and more enjoyable every day.

To Daniel Rodriguez:
Daniel was my first partner in paired coding. During the DTR we both openly discussed what we enjoyed about code, and the ways we thought we understood each step. Following with the things we thought we struggled with. Daniel's technical ability with Ruby was integral to forming the frame work of our project. He was able to flawlessy take my mechanical/logical ideas and teach me how to implement them into code. The pairing with Daniel was the bar to reach for every pairing I have had since, both with fellow 1610 students and other mod students as well. I could not have hand selected a better partner to learn along side during our early weeks at school. His input and constructive criticism were greatly appreciated, and I am certain pairing with him helped me grasp some important fundamentals in Ruby and coding in general.

To Ethan Bennett:
Ethan was my pair for our final project. Which also meant we were together for the final 2 weeks of Module 1. The pairing of Ethan and I was ironic in the way, that just a week before our assignment we had worked on a exercise on how to pair. We both came out of that exercise saying that we work well together.. but we also fell into rabbit holes together rather well too. 
Knowing this information, I think it really helped drive our DTR. We talked about Strengths, and also about limitations, time restraints and weaknesses we perceived in ourselves. This set up communication really well between us. I could not have completed this project without the communication, passion and understanding that Ethan had for both this project and us as a team. Even if I did complete the specs, it would not be something that I was as proud of. This project will live in my project showcase, and I am certain it will be something talked about as an example of what hard work, planning and team dedication are capable of presenting after 2 weeks. I have the utmost respect for Ethan as a person, a programmer and a friend. I look forward to working with Ethan in the future, and am excited about what we are capable of if paired together again.

To Brett Rivers:
Brett was one of the first people to really welcome me to the world of code. He was consistantly available to all of us new students and had a great wealth of information that he freely shared and help me personally understand. I would have had a much harder time grasping material during some of the earlier concept lectures without Bretts help. I really appreciate the way he made his time available, both with help on homework/projects and welcoming me to Turing. I am confident that I am not the only one who appreciates Brett's presence in class.

To Jason Conrad:
Jason and I were paired during the second half of the secret week at Turing. I think we were both surprised to be given a full project, with only a few days to accomplish it. Jason and I began running through our DTR process. This was my second DTR process at Turing and Jason's enthusiasm and energy really helped get us started. I greatly appreciated the passion he conveyed for the project and the pairing. Jason's speed and attention to detail during the white boarding process was inspiring. He drew a flow chart that was easily understandable and involved any and all feedback into the creative process. It truly felt like the best kind of collaboration, even before any progress was made in our text editors. 
Without Jason's enthusiasm, passion, and desire to build something great this project may have become daunting, or even worse not taught us a few valuable lessons along the way. I would welcome Jason's spirit and cooperation in any future group.

### Being a Community Member

Brett Rivers:
Jesse has been a great asset to me this module.  From chatting as we walk to the bus, to giving me very good and specific advice when faced with difficult situations.  I can honestly say that the last few weeks of this module might have driven me crazy without Jesse there to help me through.

Drew Palazzari:
Jesse is an awesome guy. He's got a great sense of humor. It really helps having someone like him around in a stressful situation like Module 1 at Turing. From day 1 we've practically been homies. He's an excellent coder and is always available for advice. I trust his advice and would be thrilled if I was ever paired with him. I consider him a friend and look forward to walking to 7/11 with him again in Module 2.

### Playing a Part

Alligning with my shift in goals this module. I embraced the better as a team concept and went out of my way to be available to my fellow cohort members.
I found it easier and easier to offer advice on subjects I felt strong in,  brief check ins with classmates usually ended in beneficial conversations about anything:
from life at school, life at home, attitudes, and opinions. Most times conversations were more life than code. This became overwhelmingly refreshing, and sort of established
a comaraderie that I had been missing since my full time participation with the militay. I felt more comfortable with my classmates and in turn they felt more comfortable with me.
I consider my shift in focus after week one a product of the culture here at Turing. Without the extra effort, attention and heart poured into us as students and equals, this 
type of social structure and interaction would be very unlikely. I want to give my gratitude to the teaching core here, they make these type of things possible.
