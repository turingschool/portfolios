# Jesse Shipley - M4 (ಥ﹏ಥ) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I started this module with a lot of interest in JavaScript, especially the React framework. I had an early goal to try and write JS as much as possible throughout the mod, in order to broaden my abilities. I felt like in one way or another I wrote something in JS every day through the mod, and have become pretty confident in that language. At the same time as gaining new skills, I did not want to lose what I have learned in Ruby so I signed up and became semi active in the pairing channels. Lending my time to some mod 1 students, and helping where I could with mod 2 and 3 as well. I believe my time was well spent as I definitely strengthened my knowledge on writing and understanding JS and also felt confident when switching between Ruby and JS written frameworks.

* 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work was mostly spent on contributions to an open source project that runs the website [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/).
Diving into the code base was the most difficult thing, I thought going in that because it was a Rails project I would have a leg up.. While that was true, it became painfully apparent that not all programmers lay out code the same way. Luckily spending so much time in Rails, I was able to dive in and find where the hints from the Project owners led me to. Using communication through Git I was able to make a change to effect an error that had been persistant and unnoticed. After submitting the WIP PR, I was asked to help with testing as they had not done that for this specific area.. So the project continues!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group Projects again were a lot of fun, I was happy to see that Casey, Ilana, and Nate were happy to make pairs out of people that we had not worked with up to this point.

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL API](https://github.com/Sh1pley/quantified_self_api)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Sh1pley/quantified-self)
* [Quantified Self](https://sh1pley.github.io/quantified_self/)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

We were challenged with creating a server and database less webpage that mimicked what we had been doing with Ruby, Rails and Postgres for the last 5 months.

## Quantified Self Week 1

On this project I worked with Jesse. We built up our jQuery skills and started testing with javascript for the first time. We became much more familiar with how to organize our javascript code and handle events with javascript.

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

### Testing

- **4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.**
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.
- 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

### JS syntax and Style

- **4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate**
- 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**
- 3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

### Project Management

- **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.**
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### Risk Taking

Adhering to any of these additional specifications will allow you to increase one score above:

- All functionality is part of a class, written using ES6
- No Libraries (except for testing). All JavaScript functionality is your own.

## Quantified Self Week 2

- The documentation for both repos is really thorough! 🎉 
- Lots of small methods.
- Nice separation of responsibility.
- It seems like you both accomplished the goals of CRUD with AJAX so nice work!

#### Bookchain

* [GitHub URL Solidity - API](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bookchain)
* [GitHub URL React](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bookchain-react)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/capstone_project_overview)

Capstone project! We really branched out, when presented the chance to try something new I really liked the idea of blockchain tech, and React.. So why not? We ran into a lot of challenges that led to a lot of learning opportunities. Learning the ins and outs of Solidity as a language, and how the 'API' sent responses.. and then having to grab those with React and parse them in the correct way was a big hurdle but worth the effort.

### 1. Project Management

*   3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.

## D: Professional Skills
Really appreciated Jeff taking the lead in our PD classes and doing more code specific sessions. I feel that as a class we really started to see why Meg, Lia and Allison were in the position they are. For all of the coding challenges we wanted, they really dropped a lot of insanely useful tips and strategies to help with job hunting. 

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/eight_mike_justin_jesse_ethan_dan.md)

This was awesome. We got to take over and teach ( in my opinion, the best ) Gear Up, Automation. As a group of Mod 4 people, we met during Gear Ups to talk about ways to improve on this lesson. It was super rewarding to give our opinions and spin on a Gear Up after having been in so many.

The group we had, consisted of a mixed group of students from mods 1 through 3. Some having been in the original, and some not. Our particular spin was to leave more room for talking on the delicate topic, and also design the group arrangements from how they felt about the subject. The discussions our group had were phenominal, and at the end during the open discussion those feelings they had persisted and really drove the talking in a positive direction.

11/10 Would totally lead a Gear Up again!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Beside the Gear Up, I joined the pairing channel after having stayed out of it for so long. I wanted to give back, similary to how I did in Mod 2 with the pairing schedule. I feel the allure of being a final module student to the fresh starters of Mod 1 benefited me more than them, as I was challenged with scoping down my knowledge to help teach instead of drive. 

I really liked this dynamic, I was able to challenge and offer open suggestions much like those in previous modules ahead of me could for my struggling self.
