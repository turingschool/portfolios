# Jesse Shipley - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

This module was a great change of pace from module 1. The tools taught in this module are tools that will learn and grow with each of us in various ways, and I feel that the structure of module 2 really let that shine and cultivate as the weeks passed.

This module I really wanted to focus on learning TDD that tested more functions and less logic. Module 1 TDD seemed to be more model testing with some functions but limited in the way were using Minitest. With the introduction of RSpec and Capybara I wanted to learn the '_Progamming like God_' approach from the video we watched during intermission. 

It was difficult to switch from this should match this exactly and function testing as I developed code in module 1, to a more here is what I think would look nice and this is how I wish it would react. It took me most of the module to get a grasp on the tools introduced. As the final week passes, I feel more comfortable in writing tests that push what I can do technically. Seeing the edge cases and sad paths that could exists, writing tests in place of randomly coding and then building an app to pass my tests.

Also the concept of least surprise with Ruby seems to impress me every day, as I find my tests passing in the most easy ways most times and that is actually surprising in itself.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Casey

Student: Jesse

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

5. Rails Style

 * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

7. Collaboration

 * 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Gryff Outdoor](gryff-outdoor.herokuapp.com)
##### [Repo](https://github.com/riverswb/gryff_outdoor)
scores here

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bike-share)

1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Individual Projects
#### [Job Tracker](https://salty-beyond-62079.herokuapp.com/dashboard)
##### [repo](https://github.com/Sh1pley/job-tracker)

1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

2) Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

5) Views

* 2.5: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

* 2.5: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

7) Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

#### [Gif Box](https://github.com/Sh1pley/GifBox)

I didn't get as far along on this as I wanted. However, it was when started using _forcasted_ type testing and really trying to approach a TDD directed plan. I used the newness of using an external API, the newness of a sort of non structored project, and my newness to Rails to really just focus on a 'dream driven' design.

Getting familiar with tools like Factory Girl, Shoulda/Matchers, Capybara and Rspec and just jumping into writing tests that seemed to contain the most straightforward method names, and expected functionality helped to show me what Rails and Ruby were capable of.

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions
The topic was not a bad one. Especially in an environment with so many varied backgrounds. In the group I was in, of the 4 of us, none of us had the same or even similar backgrounds and upbringings. Which I believe really drove home the point that a microaggression can be vastly translated into many different and conflicting things. 

I think the moral of the Gear Up (to me), was that we are all people and have feelings. The best way to possibly mitigate microaggressions is to openly communicate and try harder to not assume worst intent. Everyone has a person battle they are going through and interactions can sway in various ways depending on this.

#### Journey Mapping
This gear up was a little different, in the way that it touched on both mental wellness and maintenance and also could direct a design choice in the way that your thinking the user should interact with a product. 

I liked that framing your personal experiences varies with the ability to cope or deal with the stressors involved. This seems like a good topic to bring up when a stressful situation arises. It could help to take a step back out of the thick of the situation and try to frame it into something more explanable.

#### Grit
I think this topic really sums up most students in any category and school. The grit of a person becomes a driving reason to push forward and complete. It seems like everyone has a different reason and alternatively different 'excuses' that allow stress to invade and tamper with that purpose.

I like the topics of grit and resilience. The thoughts that everyone is fighting for something and fighting something really helps you understand a person. The attitudes, drive, and behavior all seem to make sense when your able to actually think about what a day in the life is for that person. 

Also at this point in Turing, I feel that the tools are all available to us now. Some more practiced than others, but none the less the tool box is fully open to a degree. I really find joy in diving into the capabilities in tech and to try and wrap my mind around what is possible in the future has become a sort of driving amitibion for me.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding New Opportunities
This session was very infomative. I think the tracking times and topics of when you contacted a job prospect is very smart. It seems to also be a way to allow me to hone in on what I actually want in a tech job, while at the same time keeping things realistic.
[Trello JobBoard](https://trello.com/b/O3eXcvQC/jesse-shipley-job-tracker)

#### Agile Practices & Project Management && Collaborative Communication
This topic really solidified alot of information with me, as well as a lot of my person behavior. I had the pleasure and displeasure to work with a large variety of people. All of which had vastly changing ways of 'leading'. I have also had the opportunity to lead others in many different environments. 

The articles provided were very very good reads, and I will continue to think of my team above my self in future opportunities to lead. I once had a Commander, Brigadier General Samuel Mahaney. Who always led and closed with his token saying; 'Take care of the people, and they will take care of the mission.' This continues to prove to be effective leadership in my eyes, and those of others as the articles and content of Allison's lesson would go on to teach.

#### Feedback II
I learned that one of my greatest strengths is also my biggest weakness. I have a very even keeled personality. I do not show much effects from stress and remain calm under pressure. Which is a great strength, I am able to keep peace and steer difficult tasks and topics without over reacting or getting bogged down. I lean on this heavily as it is a peaceful way for me to tackle tasks and problems. 

However, I learned the negative effect of this as well. As did my fellow team mates on the Bike Share project. I allowed myself to fall into a pretty big rabbit hole navigating a particular problem during the project. And because I perceived the groups attitude as already stressed I didn't want to add any more fuel to the fire, so I pushed on. 

Had I stopped to ask questions early on, the problem would have been fixed in the same 15 mins it took to clarify the issue with my team mates and I could have moved on to a new task to push development. This was an important lesson, and one I will carry forward with me. I now like to ask early questions/see examples of something I am maybe 'fuzzy' on. So that I can be of more use to my team.

#### Cold Outreach
This was an interesting topic and concept to the class as a whole I felt. I do like the idea of putting a friendly email out to show interest and to broaden your connections in a world that seems to be so very connected. I have been making it a point to attend all guest speakers and to add each one to my LinkedIn as well. To be able to lean on the experience here at Turing and connect on the subjcts of topics brought to us that I feel are interesting and engaging.

I have reached out to contacts at companies like: HyprLoco, CaptainU, Granicus, and the City of Ft. Collins.

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Bike Share:
Annie:
  Annie was amazing as a group partner in our Bike Share project. I always enjoyed
her upbeat attitude in class, and eagerness to bond and become friends as a large class.
This attitude was even more apparent in a group of four. She immediately found ways to
make everything more exciting. Her planning, preparedness and strong technical toolset
was vital to the progress of our project.

Although stress of the project and short timeframe got to all of us, Annie remained
as good natured and upbeat as she always is. Annie was irreplaceable as a member of our group
and without her I feel our learning and satisfaction in the journey would have suffered.

I would love to work with Annie again on a future project. Her happiness and ability to make 
everyone feel included is an amazing trait that really makes our cohort better as a whole.

Laszlo:
  Working with Laszlo was an outstanding experience.
His inviting approach to tutoring, guidance and overall team work was 
really refreshing to have in our first larger group project.

His attitude and enthusiasm never shifted even when things were getting busy/stressful.
He made it a point to be in charge of keeping us smiling, and in an upbeat mood.
He did this without fail, even when he might not have been in the mood to.

I would love to work with Laszlo again in a future project, and his ability
to include everyone in our group into every bit of our project really encompasses
what Turing is about.

Marisa:
  Marisa was a great group partner on our Bike Share project. As a group we were all 
very new to building a functioning web app, with a user experience. Inspite of all
the new ideas and concepts, Marisa really dove in and tackled many aspects that were
foreign to us. Through all of her hard work, she was an outstanding communicator and
great to work with. 

I found her sense of humor, and genuine love for programming really set a mindset
with us all, that this was a project we could be proud of. I would
welcome the opportunity to work with Marisa again in a future project. Her 
attitude, focus and want for success really was important to group moral and 
the pride we all had in the end product.

#### Feedback for Little Shop

Brett:
  Brett was an outstanding Project Manager and team member in our final project.
  His attention to detail, and thoroughness really kept our project on track. 
  His code review really helped in catching small things that could/would have led 
  to much bigger headaches.

  Brett's attitude and direction really set a productive pace without pushing or 
  demanding anything from the team that Brett wouldn't have done his self. I would 
  really enjoy working with Brett again on a future project. His work style, pace, 
  and effort really were a great thing to have in a group.

Ethan:
  Working with Ethan again this module was another great experience. His dedication 
  and work processes really helped form our work pace as a team. Ethan took on the 
  majority of styling and helping the rest of us further understand how styling might 
  be handled in such a large project.

  I really look forward to being paired with Ethan again, and keeping our streak of
  project collaboration alive.

David:
  Having never worked with David before, I was really excited to be paired with him
  on this large project. I have seen his past projects and sat near him during some
  group collaborative efforts and always admired his understanding of Ruby. 

  Being part of a team with David in it, did not disappoint my expectations. His
  knowledge and understanding of the tools that Ruby and Rails give us was a great
  asset to us as a group. His helpful attitude really helped me learn a few additional
  things in Rails that I was unsure about, and definitely helped solidify concepts
  covered in this project. I would love to be paired with David again on any future
  projects we may have.


#### Other Feedback

Drew:
  Drew and I paired on many class assignments, including our project Job Tracker.
Drew brings alot of technical capability and ideas to programming and this cohort.
He never shys away from challenging his knowledge with code, and is outstanding 
at expressing his thought processes while programming.

I enjoy having Drew in our cohort, his friendly attitude and willingness to learn 
really enhances the experience of Turing. I look forward to working with, and 
completing future projects at Turing with Drew.
  

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Bike Share

From Laszlo:
  Great working with you on the Bike-Share project! I appreciated very much that you set the tone with your calmness for the team. Besides that always ready to listen to all the opinions and decide on the next steps.
You did a great job of pushing through the “ugly” pieces, such as CSV import, which never seems to be a popular choice.
I loved the fact that following our technical discussions, you still put in effort to research a subject further to understand it as best as possible.

Positive highlight:
Staying calm through the entire time

Actionable item:
As a PM, please try to use your position to drive progress. In case there is a deadlock, such as picking topics, jump in and pick topics for everyone. That would trigger progress and further discussion if needed to adjust assignments.

From Annie:
  Jesse is a dedicated and enthusiastic team member. He served as project manager and was the solid foundation that made our group so successful. He is one of the most even-headed people I have ever encountered, which was so valuable when the stress of the project got tough. On top of the pressure of Turing, he has many outside responsibilites that he seemd to juggle effortlessly. He's a wonderful community member and I'm so glad to have him on my team.
  
From Marisa:
  Jesse was so much fun to work with. He was so hardworking and focused on learning and finishing the difficult iterations we handed off to him. Jesse is such a team player, and is a quick, analytical learner. Even when we are stressed, he is always there to crack a joke and make everyone feel a little more relaxed. He is great at showing support, appreciation, and open to asking for help when he needs it. I really enjoyed working with and would work with him again.

#### Feedback from Little Shop

From Brett:
  Jesse is a natural leader and problem solver that balances what needs to be said with what needs to be done, to motivate the entire team.  I really appreciated that when things came up in your home life that would keep you from communicating with the group you let us know about how long you would be unreachable, hopefully you don't need to go change flat tires too often, but when you do letting the team know you are unreachable is valuable.

From David:
  Jesse you were the calming wind of the group, you injected humor into every conversation which was vital to maintaining group moral.  In terms of your contributions to the groups workload I couldn’t help but notice that you constantly volunteered to do any issue that came up on the waffle board and were always eager to be a second set of eyes. In other words keep doing what your doing and you’ll go far. It was a pleasure and an honor to have completed little shop with you.

From Ethan:
  Jesse: I was under the impression we’d always have new teammates, so it was a pretty nice surprise to work with you again. As with last time, I think it’s pretty cool that we can split work as effectively as we do—on whatever schedule we have to be on—and totally trust each other to get the work done. I also happen to be a little too reliant on dad jokes myself, so it’s been fun to have so much dry, sarcastic, and unfunny humor flying around the group all the time.
#### Other Feedback for me

From Drew:
  Jesse is a great person to pair with. He brings limitless knowledge, as well as attained knowledge from his mentor that helps profusely. He comes up with excellent ideas, but is also open to hearing/trying other ideas. He is a good friend and a good guy. I honestly have no room for improvement feedback to give him.
  
From Molly:
  Hey Jesse! I was looking for you this morning to tell you in person, but I just wanted to say that I thought your lightning talk this morning was *awesome*. I feel like you are the first person I have seen at Turing so far give a lightning talk the right way, in that you picked a small topic and dug into it in a though-provoking way. I plan on doing my best to try to do it your way in the future


## E: Community Participation

This module, I wanted to give back to the beginning Cohort. I really enjoyed the way pairing from module 2 to module 1 was presented to us and the learning and growth I was able to achieve by using fellow students at Turing. I gave 2 to 3 time slots each week for the first 4 weeks of this module. Only stopping when our work load started picking up and I felt like I was slipping behind. 

I structured my pairing in the best possible way to teach and drive 'answer finding' instead of 'answer giving'. I thought the methods taught early on were presented in the same way and served as a way to show us that anything is findable with a little effort.
