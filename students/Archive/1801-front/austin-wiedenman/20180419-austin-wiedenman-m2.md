# Austin Wiedenman - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this Mod were focused around understanding the fundamentals of scope, es6, React, and manipulating Objects and Arrays.  I also had a strong focus on reworking my current, and implementing new, organizational processes.  I have been working towards using proper terminology and slowing down when explaining my thought process.  I feel like I have adopted organizational skills that will serve me well in future mods, my career and my personal life.  I am now using trello to layout my overall workload and then using google calendar to time-box out each time slot in my day to visualize how to complete each task.  After my Complete-Me project I felt a urgent need to get better at explaining my thought process and using proper terminology.  I used my daily Array/Objects workout to practice this a great deal.  I feel  like I have a strong understanding of each prototype method and what each of them input and output and I have taken leaps and bounds forward in my ability to pseudo-code a direction towards solving problems.

* **E: Final Assessment**: 3.25

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Over this mod I have gotten better at being aware of  my learning style and making more of an effort to reach out to mentors and do more one-on-one paired work with alumni and people in upper mods.  The individual projects this mod were an eye-opening experience.  Both of the concepts that we covered pushed my logic and understanding far beyond where it existed prior.  I think that the most challenging part of these projects was understanding how tries work.  I think that the binary tree was easy, but when working on the prefix trie, I had a hard time.

### Study Habits

I had a complete overhaul in the way that I conduct myself organizationally.  I have put a huge focus on not only developing and implementing new ways to stay organized and manage workflow, but also sticking with them.  This is something that throughout my entire life I have struggled with and I have put great effort into breaking old habits and time-boxing more realistically.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I enjoyed learning about sorting algorithms.  I think that I really benefitted from a combination of both the cards and white-boarding to really trace the process and strengthen my understanding.  I think working together on this project was much different than our paired projects and was a very communal process.  I think that it was nice to have a variety of minds to bounce ideas off of.  During our job search it is going to be extremely important to be able to speak to these types of algorithms and articulate these ideas in order to stand out among computer science majors who have spent months learning these concepts.


### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 2.5
* **Process:** 2
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Testing & Code Sanitation:**  3

I enjoyed learning what is actually behind the auto-complete functionality that we all use everyday.  During this project it felt like the communal work was a bit different.  I think that there was more pairing off into groups.  I think that it was challenging going from a basic idea like a binary trie and jumping right into a prefix trie, but think that the experience was beneficial overall.  Once again, during our job search it is going to be extremely important to be able to speak to these types of algorithms and articulate these ideas in order to stand out among computer science majors who have spent months learning these concepts.


## B: Group Work & Projects
GameTime-

I think GameTime was a great opportunity into how to get used to setting up and working with classes and multiple JS files.  The most challenging part of this project was most certainly the gravity and collision detection. I want to continue to get better at OOP and TDD

* **JS/React Style:**3
* **Testing:** pending
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:**pending

Working react was a nice change of pace from the previous two projects.  I was nice to be working in the browser again and  learning a new skill that we will be using in mod3 and beyond.   Cleaning data was difficult at first, but eventually was a great way to put all of the array and object practice that I have done to good use.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
*Agile Practices, Feedback 1, Feedback 2, Storytelling, Networking 
During the PD sessions I liked learning more about a agile process and I think that I was able to
Use this during all of my projects.  I think that being able to circle back around and refactoring throughout the process is powerful for moving forward in an efficient manner.  I also think that thinking about our story is good rot do because it is really hard to talk about and it is good to start that now.


* **Gear Up Sessions:**
* Empathy & Privilege, Group Think/Attention, Economy/Tragedy of Commons, digital privacy 
I really liked the conversation about privilege and also the one about digital privacy the most. I think that the idea of privilege is something that is overlooked, especially by white males, and I think we had a really cool conversation about how we all have different perspectives and it is important to think about other people’s life experiences and worldview.  Digital privacy is something is going to continue to be an increasingly important to consider as time goes on.

## Community Participation

Over this mod I enjoyed pairing with mod1 students on projects and helping them work through issues.  I also serve as the co-lead of Phalka.  This is a great experience and I look forward to being able to contribute more to the group as my understanding of react continues to grow.


## Final Assessment

I am going to focus heavily on react and on arrays and objects over this intermission.  I also want to read uno more on jest, enzyme and testing react in general. I am really looking forward to working more with react and digging into api’s more. I am going to sleep in, laugh as much as I can with my wife, and read materials that I have reached out to Christie for and get ahead so I can hit the ground running mod3.
