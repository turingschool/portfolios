## Areas of Emphasis

My focus on this mod was to master objects and array prototypes, to get better at solving problems and to feel more confident with JS, also I wanted to finish this mod understanding React. I think I achieved all my goals, I now enjoy writing code and I'm way more confident at solving problems.

## A: Individual Work & Projects


# Study Habits
This Mod I tried to balance better my time, I spent a lot of time studing but also I made time for my family and friends. I think really helped me to stay energized and motivated

# Sorting Suite
For this project, we had to implement fundamental sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insert sort, quick sort, merge sort. I enjoyed it because it gave me a better understanding of algorithms, recursion and sorting perfomance.

Outcome: Pass!

# Complete Me
For this project, we had to create a trie data structure with an insert and suggest method. I populated a trie with a dictionary with a populate method and then implemented an autocomplete feature called suggest.

# Weathrly

We made a weather forecasting app using React JS and the Weather Underground API. This was a fun project . We also implemented a testing suite using Jest and Enzyme. This was my favorite project on mod 2 because we learned so many things!, we learned React, APIs, SAAS and React testing

## Gear Up Sessions:
#Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege:

I really enjoyed this session! it made us realize how easy is to assume things about people without really knowing what they've been thru and how they really are. As I mention in the session, people assume a lot of things because I'm from Colombia and most thing aren't true, so the main takeaway is that we should empathize with others, understand our privilages and not take them for granted.


#Gear Up 2: Mindfulness 

This session was super helpful because we talked about ways to focus in the present and not think too much about the future or other things that can distract us. By doing this we'll be more focused, motivated and less stressed. Also in the session we did a couple exercises and stretches that felt great! 

Community Participation

In this mod I paired a lot with peoples from upper and lower mods and with my mentors. Also we had the opportunity to show our project in the code fair, it was a great experience and we won!
