### Number Guesser 

I enjoyed doing Number Guesser, I think this was a great way to start using basic vanila javascript. We also got to practice HTML and CSS.

### Static Comp Challenge

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Projects

## Linked Lists
Linked List was an awesome project, we did it all in vanila JS so we learned a lot about creating elements, appending and removing elements.

## IdeaBox
In Idea Box we had to put in practice everything we had learn about HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery and DOM manipulation. This project also introduced us to local storage.

### Evaluation Comments -- Evaluated by Nathaniel 
### Evaluation Scores
### Functional Expectations
*Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
Does not save when quality changes
### HTML
### Accessibility
*Novice Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
*No alt tags for img elements
### Style
*Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
*Poor Indentation
### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
### Implementation
* Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
### Data Types
* Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
### Conditional Logic
* Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
### Objects & Prototypes
* Novice Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.  
### DOM Manipulation
* Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
### Style
* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs..
### Git
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
### Comp Recreation
* Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
### PAIRING
* Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## 2DoBox
2DoBox involved refactoring other people's code from IdeaBox and building upon it. It was interesting to work with someone else’s code.

### Gear Up
 

* **Stress management:** 

* When I first started at Turing, I had a little bit of experience with wordpress and basic web design, and it was mostly a hobby that I really enjoyed. When you turn a hobby in to a career, I think its very common to encounter a lot of stress and feel pressure that wasn’t there when you were just doing side projects for fun. This has definitely been true at Turing, because the classes are so intense. But what helps me is looking at it like exercise for your mind. When I feel stressed, I try my best to imagine it as being tired after a hard work out, in the end it makes you stronger and happier.

 
* **Working styles introvert / extrovert / ambivert**

* Even though I’ve always seen myself as an extrovert, I’ve realized when it comes to working, I actually prefer some space. My favorite working style is to divide up tasks, tackle them separately, then regroup to discuss and move forward. That style fits well with introverts, but a lot of people enjoy working together much more closely throughout the whole process. At a big company, I think that it’s more likely that a high level of collaboration will be required from start to finish. I’d like to figure out how make people who feel the need for close collaboration feel comfortable, while still maintaining enough space to allow everyone to be productive.

 
* **Getting Better at Difficult Things:**

* I feel very comfortable with some of the things we have studied, but others have been much harder. One of the most important things is to not get scared and intimidated by hard topics. Getting stressed out hurts the ability to think clearly, and makes progress even hard. I definitely need to focus on remembering that when it comes to some of the more challenging topics, like objects and prototypes.

 
* **Personal Stories & Connection**

* I love how different everyone in the class is, there is a great range of ages and backgrounds and skill sets. It’s a great place to learn, because everyone has such a different style and perspective that you get to hear things explained in lots of different ways. The group study sessions are great for this, I remember I finally had a moment when objects clicked for me after hearing 3 of my classmates try and explain it in totally different ways.

 
* **Avoiding burnout** 

* One of his pieces of advice was to not treat it like a marathon. “The brain is not dumb muscle”, and you can’t just work it till you collapse and expect to get better. I’ve noticed that when I really feel “on”, I can accomplish 10x as much in an hour as when I’m feeling “off”. I haven’t quite figured out what it is that just makes everything click sometimes, but I am starting to focus a lot on learning about what I need to do to handle those times when I’m just not feeling productive.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I started by getting to know people in my cohort, I think overall we are a great group that supports each other, also I contacted people from other mods, did a couple pairings every week and I'm very happy that I found other Latinos like Jorge and Aldo that are super supportive. Next mod I plan on becoming more involved in the community at Turing.
