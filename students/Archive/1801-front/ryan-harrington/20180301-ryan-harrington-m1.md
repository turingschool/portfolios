# Ryan Harrington - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this mod were to really nail down everything I felt wobbly on last mod and get a head start on what might help me in mod2. Mythical Creatures is what I felt worst on first round, now I feel very confident in that. The benchmark I set to know whether I really had it down, was when I help people I never look back at my previous answers (deleting them after helps with this). Another area I struggled, array prototypes. Now I feel really comfortable using them. Even if I haven't used the specific one I need, I can mess with it in the console for a few minutes and figure it out. Going to Iron FE helped with this a lot by not getting scared off of slightly new syntax, or new concepts. I feel very confident going into mod2 that I'll be a good partner, and I couldn't have said that if I hadn't repeated. Utilizing the mentor list has also been a big benefit.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I accomplished a great deal this mod. Unlike last mod, I was always able to follow along in lectures and dig deeper into questions I came up with from problems the previous mod. Huge improvement and I'm very confident in my foundation going into mod 2.

Feedback from Sage: 
Hi Ryan, Here is your feedback from Sage “Ryan we crushed it and I think our skills came together and made a pretty phenomenal LinkedList. Your experience with CSS techniques for positioning were awesome. We wrote scripts with jQuery right off the bat, which I was originally somewhat concerned about because I had not learned the material yet. The same goes for our mobile first techniques. However, you explained everything well and made sure I was following every step of the way. These skills turned out to be a huge takeaway from the project for me and I’m really glad we used jQuery and mobile first planning. You were on time and willing to work as long as we needed to, I really appreciated that. It seemed like we both rolled forward when there was a good project flow going. You were good at pushing and pulling with github as well and help me personally a lot with that. I also appreciate that you were willing to hear me out on a lot of my ideas, I know I can be stubborn on them.  The only coaching feedback I have about our pairing is that you came to class one morning with completely redesigned buttons that we didn’t talk about. It wasn’t that big of deal because you didn’t push!  If you had talked to me about it we could have worked on it together.”

Feedback from Eric:

I was actually really worried going into this project that since you had a better grasp on it than me that you would breeze through it and I'd get left behind. But honestly, you did a great job of letting me make mistakes along the way and pointing me in the right direction to help me figure something out, instead of just telling me the right way to do it. If there's any small bit of coaching I could give you I guess it would just be maybe to explain a bit more your reasoning for things when setting up how you'd like to work on the project. For instance, it seemed a bit crazy to me that you were pushing to put in 3 hours of work on the project right away on Friday night. I didn't realize until later that that set us up to do a lot of good work over the weekend and put us in a great place on our project going into the week. So I'd just recommend explaining the reasoning behind things like that so it seems less crazy from the start.

## D: Professional Skills
The Professional Development sessions gave me a great material to work on for all non-technical skills in the industry. This is important, because as this article (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/?utm_term=.ccd4dfa80c49) points out. Even at Google, the things that ultimately make people succeed or not happen at a personal level. Improved communication, empathy with your team, and your users will go a long way. Focusing on my strenghts and how I can apply them in a way that will be most valued will be something that sets me apart from self-taught and people with less experience pair-programming.  This was most apparent when I paired with Saige, which was a great pairing, because we both very firmly wanted to do our approach on given instances and we had to cordially compromise. One of my strengths was self-assurance and I assure you, I was very sure of my strategy and so was he. We both did a little giving and a little taking. Which is how I think the industry will be. People will be strong-willed, stubborn, or sure their way is better and I'll have to persuade them of my ways merit or go all the way in on their way. That was probably my best experience here yet. 


### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

*[GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)


The growth mindset gear up keeps the idea fresh to be inspired by success not feel threatened by it.  When someone does something really well, they just upped the bar. It doesn't make mine any better or worse. It just opens up possibilities for what I'll do on the next project.

#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Learning more in depth about not wasting cognitive resources was very helpful. It's basically a well articulated concept of not focusing on things you can't control and expanding on it. This explains why I often don't want to play agame of chess right after playing someone else. This relates to my career because the work is a very serious cognitive drain so I shouldn't waste my limited cognitive resources on things that arent' productive.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

Taking a second to give a little extra thought to what my working style is as well as those around me will help all of us be at our best. Turing has shown me that I'm more introverted than I thought. When I'm working on a project, I'm starting to like silence and minimal interaction while I'm at the crux of the problem. Sometimes collaborating helps too, and someone says something in a different way that causes that lightbulb to turn on. 


#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Keeping in mind the different types of stress can be helpful, even life-saving. Stress kills, but stress also pushes us to improve, advance, learn, get stronger, or whatever you're striving for. Keeping a healthy balance of eustress to improve yourself is good, and to keep distress under control when under your control.

### Learning Through Teaching

This was an interesting gear up. It was a good reminder that the person who is teaching you is just a human, and so is the person that you're teaching. Not getting frustrated with someone because you don't understand their instruction, or they don't understand yours is important because all those cognitive resources would be better spent working on the problem, than on thinking how the problem isn't being solved. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I felt comfortable with the material this mod so I had the opportunity to help people with projects, studying for pentathlon, ec. Which was awesome. I wasn't able to do that before, and I plan to stay in a position where I can be someone with answers to help my classmates. This was a huge benefit to me also, because asking guiding questions to lead someone in the right direction can still have a bit of deviation from the path I would go. Sometimes someone will do the same task in a different way than I would, and it works but I don't know why, or doesn't work and looks like it makes sense is good because I then dive farther into it to figure out why it is(not) working and get a deeper understanding of the pieces.
