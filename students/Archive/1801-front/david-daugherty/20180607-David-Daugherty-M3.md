## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to try and absorb as much knowledge as possible. I wanted to build a solid foundation since I know that the things we learned in this mod will be the bulk of what I'll be doing on the job. I set out to take this opportunity as serious as possible to gain the most out of this school. I knew going in that this was going to be hard and there will be moments where I may struggle but I wanted to keep an optimistic attitude for what my future will hold when I finish Turing. I know I tend to keep to myself a lot so I may not be as active in the community as I should but I tried to restart the design posse but didn't have much success/ interest.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass - I believe I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 4.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were SwapiBox and my Personal Project.

#### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/swapi/doc/scores.md)


For SwapiBox I was tasked to create a site that pulled data in from the Star Wars Api and display it as cards. The big take away for this was to learn react and fetch calls on your own to really solidify their concepts. This project really challenged me by relying on myself to learn all the inner details of react with out relying on anyone else.

**Feedback:**  
Focus on testing.

#### Personal Project - Sportsball

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Sportsball)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/tree/master/1801/mod-3/personal-projects)

For Sportsball I created an application for people who want to know the bare minimum about what happened with their favorite baseball team the day before. The app takes in baseball data from the sportsradar api and then cleans and repurposes that data into small digestable bits so a person can have a conversation about the game without actually knowing much at all. In this project I used react, redux and router. The biggest challenge was data cleaning but it challenged me to get better at it and think overall I became better after it.

**Feedback:**

## C: Group Work & Projects

The group projects I completed this Mod were HeadCount and Movie-Tracker.

### Projects

#### Head-Count

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/headcount/saemus-theresa-doc/scores.md)

For head count we were tasked to create an app that pulled data in from a data set, clean it and display it in a digestable way. The goal of this project was to get more comfortable with react and to get better at cleaning data.

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/movie-tracker/sage-doc-alan/scores.md)

This was the first time using redux in a project as well as router. We were tasked to create an application that pulls movies from the movieDB api and populate them on the page. The user is able to select and favorite movies as well as have a user account tha stores their favorites. This project had a lot going on and was by far the hardest project I've been a part of at turing. We learned a lot and worked extremely hard on this project and I believe it showed in the end.

**Feedback:**  
Make multiple actions files and import into one.


## D: Professional Skills
This mod, we learned about how to tailor our resumes and learned about getting better at answering interview questions. We also were tasked to build an alumni profile page for after Turing.

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Agression

In this session we talked about what microagressions are and how we should be more mindful of things we say because certain things that may seem harmless might actually be really offensive to someone around you. We also talked about . how we need to step in an confront people that are using microagressions.

#### Gender Gap

In this session we talked about how why women are under represented in the tech word today. We watched a movie and then got into small groups and discuessed our opinions about why it the way it is and ways we can help change it.

#### AI

In this session we talked about all the diiferent ways AI is effecting the world. We also discussed ethical delemmas that come about with the advancement in AI and how we would deal with it. It was cool to see where the AI field is heading and how there will be a big change coming where we need to be mindful of the AI around us and whether its good or bad.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
Overall, I feel like I did an adequate job of being involved in the Turing community. I helped classmates with their projects when I could help and tried to attend a few social gatherings when I could. For the next mod I'm challenging myself to become more invovled in the community by helping others in the mods below me as well as trying to be more social and connecting with other mods other than my own. I am going to head the design posse again and hopefully it can garner more interest than I had last mod. I have noticed in my time here that design is often considered an afterthought but it can be a big asset in getting your work noticed for potential jobs so I want to help others more in making their designs better..
