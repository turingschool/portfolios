# David Daugherty - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to try and absorb as much knowledge as possible. I wanted to build a solid foundation so that later down the line I can go proform better once we get into more complex things. I set out to take this opportunity as serious as possible to gain the most out of this school. I knew going in that this was going to be hard and there will be moments where I may struggle but I wanted to keep an optimistic attitude for what my future will hold when I finish Turing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pending - Although I believe I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 2.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were the Number Guesser and the three Static Comp Challenges.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/number-guesser/david-daugherty.md)

For my number guesser I created a number guessing game where you have to guess a number between 10 and 100 with only 10 tries. I later added a level increase after every correct guess increasing the number by 10 after each win.

**Evaluator: Nathaniel**
This was my first taste of how Turing does evaluations and set a baseline of what to expect going forward. In this project Nathaniel had some positive things to say about my number guesser and wanted me to strive to try and complete the next phase of the project when I got a chance. Some of the feedback included using a button instead of input type button and to make functions out of code I use more than once.

#### Static Comp One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/dd-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For the first static comp I was asked to create a metro style layout where tiles needed to be re-arranged to create a responsive design.

**Evaluator: Pam**
My feedback was limited to making my icons a bit smaller and making the text a bit bigger in some of the smaller screens

#### Static Comp Two

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/DD-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For the second static comp I was asked to create a card style layout similar to those like pintrest. The site needed to be fully responsive. 

**Evaluator: Pam**
The feedback that I recieved was that I neede to check smaller phone sizes than iPhone 7 because it didn't scroll right on the iPhone 5. Another was to use aria better.

#### Static Comp Three

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/DD-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

For the third comp I was tasked with creating an fairly complex layout with a lot of moving parts. This is a layout that really tested the limits of my css and html knowledge. Overall it was a great experience and really learned to keep my elements as modular as possible during the contruction of the page. Because of this I feel I was able to manipulate the various element the way I wanted when deconstructing it for mobile and other smaller screen sizes.

**Evaluator: Pam**
My overall feedback was very positive. Pam believed I was very true to the comp and that only had minor nit picky things to say about the overall composition. Some of the feedback was that I should use rems instread of pixels and that I should look into organizing my css idiomatically.

## C: Group Work & Projects



### Projects

#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ecksi/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/linked-list/jim-david.md)

This was the first partner project and it was a great experience. Jim and I hit the ground running and really worked well together. Together we got to phase 4 and exceeded my expectations for the project. We were tasked with building a card creation website that allowed users to enter Titles and website urls and would create a card with that information.

**Evaluator: Pam**  
* Through all 4 phases!
* Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up
* GREAT job with the rickroll!!

**CSS:** Advanced Beginner/Proficient  
**JS:** Proficient  
**Git:** Proficient  
**Pairing:** Proficient  

**Feedback:**  
Organize css idiomatically and not just alphabetically, don't remove focus outline, practice talking through your code, unnecessary variables.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kyleewellons/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/idea-box/david-kylee.md)

This was the first time I really felt the Turing struggle with a project. For this project I really had to take on the bulk of the load to finish the project on time to a level which I felt acceptable. Instead of panicing I reached out to resources by pairing and talking with my mentor to get the project done. For this project we were tasked with creating cards that have a title and body copy. The twist with this project however was that it needed to save to local storage so everything would stay on the screen on page refresh.

**Evaluator: Nathaniel**  

**Functional Expectations:** Proficient

**Git:** Advanced Beginner  
**Design:** Proficient  
**Pairing:** Proficient  

**Feedback:**  
Look into using vendor prefixes for box-sizing, be careful using the || operator to set a default value, only use the event object if you pass it into the function as an argument, declare variables at the top of their scope. Do not declare variables in if/else or for blocks, use forEach to iterate over an array, rename IdeaObjectCreator to Idea or Idea, move html generation into Idea.prototype.generateHTML method

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-1/to-do-box/jack-david.md)

In this project we were tasked to take another persons code and refractor it, clean it up and add on some additional features to make it a to do box instead of an IdeaBox. This project really tested our resolve by pushed us to really have empathy when we code. It was a good lesson to really nail home the fact that your code needs to be understandable for others other than yourself. 

**Evaluator: Pam**  
* About 80% of the time spent refactoring the project
* Tried to run through a screenreader
* changed the class names from camelCase in HTML. Added ARIA attributes

## D: Professional Skills
This mod, we learned about ways to manage stress, working with people who have varying personality types, and getting out of a fixed mindset.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [Getting Better at Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

In this session I came away with a new take on how to learn. From this gear up I gained some prospective on how learning new things is hard and it takes time but it will get easier over time. I also took away that I need to eliminate things that take up cognative load on myself so I can fully devote time to learning.

#### Working Styles

* [Working Styles](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

In this session I gained a new prospective on other personality types and that when it all boils down that we are very similar to eachother. I also learned to repect those with differing working styles and accept that they might offer something beneficial that I may not possess. I also began to reflect on what recharges me and gets me ready and focused.

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

* [Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

In this session I learned about how to manage my stress and to take care of myself which will help with stress levels. We all deal with stress in different ways and the biggest takeaway was that I need to find ways that work for me that will help with my stress. 

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [Personal Stories & Connection](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)
 
In this session I started to really think about my personal story and why I came to Turing in the first place. While in the short amount of time we go to craft our stories I felt like I began to really start to create a captivating story that will hopefully overtime become a great story for interested empployers.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
Overall, I feel like I did an adequate job of being involved in the Turing community. I took advantage of pairings when needed and reached out to alums for help. I helped classmates with their projects when I could help and tried to attend a few social gatherings when I could. For the next mod I'm challenging myself to become more invovled in the community by helping others in the mods below me as well as trying to be more social and connecting with other mods other than my own.
