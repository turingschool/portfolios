# Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest Achievement

I think the biggest achievement in this module was putting all the technologies I have learned together to create a capstone that I am truly proud of. Thinking back just 7 months ago and struggling to create number guesser to today where I am building full applications it makes me think about what I will be able to achieve in the next 7 months.

## Biggest struggle

The biggest struggle for me this mod was relearning jQuery. It is crazy with how much we have learned in the past 7 months but at the same time how much we forget. Coming in to this mod and having not used jQuery in 3 months was a struggle. The thing I learned most about that struggle was how much faster you can relearn something than when you had first learned it.  

Another struggle was just staying focused on the task at hand. In mod 4 you can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it can be a stuggle to really put the full amount of energy to really do well. 

## What sets me apart? 

I think the biggest thing that I have done to set myself apart is by creating projects that are polished and detail oriented. I wanted to really differentiate myself as a developer/designer and I feel that when I work on a project that the look and feel of the application I am building is just as important as the code that use to write it. Even though at points I might have been obsessive over the look and feel I think in the long run it will pay off with future employers. 

When I start a project I make sure to really do as much research as possible before writing any code so that I can kind of gauge what hurdles I might encounter and how to structure everything so the project goes as smooth as possible.

## Full stack experience
I personally am grateful to learn some backend technologies. It really broadens my scope of what is possible as a programmer. I however, believe that learning backend solidified my choice that the frontend was the correct choice for me and that it is what I will be focusing my job search on.

## Skillset

I think the most important skill learned I learned at Turing is perseverance. Coming into Turing I was never fully challenged. I was able to coast through most everything and it never really affected me in any meaningful way. Turing however, showed me that I am capable of really finishing something that at some points along the way I thought I might not be capable of doing. The Doc of 7 months ago would have never believed he was able to completely code out a PWA and have it be usable. From this newly found skill it makes me believe that whatever I set my mind to that I will be able to figure it out and succeed.
