# Seamus Quinn - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Mod1 very excited and nervous to learn code. My goals were as follows: work as hard as I can every day, learn voraciously, push myself to be the best learner I can be, and to view failure as an opportunity, not a hindrance.  My goals are process oriented, not outcome oriented.  I feel as though I have accomplished all of my goals.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects consisted of 3 paired programming assignments: Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox. Each project expanded on the previous and added new features requiring us to expand our JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML/CSS skills. The final paired project, 2DoBox, was an exercise in which we were given another group's IdeaBox project and tasked with parsing, re-factoring, and adding new features to effectively pivot the IdeaBox to the 2DoBox theme without scrapping the original code base.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is an application that allows the user to create bookmarks that contain a title and a link.

#### Student: Seamus and Jim
#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

#### comp
- edit is a little buggy
- bugginess with delete button
- Love the smush button

#### html
- label or aria label, pick one or the other

#### css
- dedup, break out rules into more broad selectors
- consider using more broad classes instead of using comma seperated selectors
- could consider using @import
- consider using bem
- LOVE the organizational comments

#### js
- Decouple the data model from the markup
- Idea for constuctor function
- Attempt to refactor similar blocks of code into their own functions that take dynamic pieces as arguments (ie. editTitle and editBody could be one function that takes an argument)

#### git/github
- Good amount of commits.
- Say more in each one.

#### Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

#### HTML

#### Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
* Exceptional Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.


#### CSS

#### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
* Exceptional Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.

#### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
* Exceptional Uses variety array prototypes to iterate through arrays and manipulate/create new arrays without using documentation as a resource.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

#### GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

#### DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### PAIRING

#### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seamus-quinn/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was an exercise in which we were given another group's IdeaBox project and tasked with parsing, re-factoring, and adding new features to effectively pivot the IdeaBox to the 2DoBox theme without scrapping the original code base.

#### Evaluator: Nathaniel
#### Notes/What To Work On:

#### Functional Expectations
* Advanced Beginner  
partial phase 3 - nothing past importance

#### HTML

#### Accessibility
* Advanced Beginner  

aria-label, maybe use describedby for long text
aria-live would probably make more sense on the list where you are adding the todos

#### Style
* Advanced Beginner  
watch out for elements w single child

#### CSS

#### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner  
Have a strategy for organizing your css properties. Alphabetical is an easy way to get started.

#### Implementation
* Proficient  


#### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types
* Proficient  

#### Conditional Logic
* Proficient  

#### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner  

Do not invoke a function when passing it in as a parameter, i.e. `$(document).ready(persistUserData());`

#### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner  

Try using a forEach in the future when looping over an array

#### Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner  
Try to create a prototype function to generate the html

Great constructor function, however you never actually pass in an id, title, body, quality or completed, so you might as well just default all of those values

#### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  

#### Style
* Advanced Beginner  
upVote and downVote share a lot of functionality, the only thing different is how the next quality is decided, you could move that out into two seperate functions and combine the rest.

editTitleContent and editBodyContent are almost the same, you could use a conditional statement to determine if the title or body should be assigned a value.

good job refactoring the search into one function that could take any selector. 

#### GIT & GITHUB

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Stress Mgmt 101


#### Health & Wellness - Stress Management

I really enjoyed learning about stress management.  I think that I have struggled in the past with managing stress and really learned some useful techniques that have allowed me to manage my stress fairly well this module.  I have found a lot of success in recognizing warning signs and responding with healthy forms of stress relief.  I still have a long way to go to get where I want to be in terms of stress management, but this session definitely gave me some useful tools to get me there.

#### Working Styles

This session was great.  I really enjoyed learning about the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially wihtin the context of Turing and the software development world.  I have found myself portraying characteristics of both in my time at Turing.  It is important to understand how I express myself, my work style, and my habits, so that I can work well with others.  This session, helped me understand myself better as a person and as a developer.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

Growth Mindest is something I have been familiar with for a while, as I have been working in the education field for the past three years.  I think it is an incredibly valuable state of mind and can truly transform anyone who is willing to put in the hard work.  Although I have taught many students, and have tried to instill a sense of growth mindset in them, it is completely different to be able to do that for myself.  Being the coach for someone else is much easier than doing it for yourself, but I think that my background in teaching has allowed me to approach myself in the same way I would approach a student, providing praise for the process and the learning, not the outcome.

#### Mod 4's Gear Up (Avoiding Burnout)

I went to the Mod 4 presentation on Avoiding Burnout.  It was very interesting to hear the multiple perspectives of students who have been through almost the entire program.  They had a lot of valuable insights and tips to share.  It was valuable to me to have a discussion about burnout.  It allowed me to recognize some signs of burnout in myself, and hopefully divert them so that the stress of being at Turing does not lead me down the road to burnout. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My focus for Mod1 has been primarily on my development as a programmer.  I have not put much into the community of Turing due to this strong focus.  I have greatly enjoyed being a part of this place and have come to know some great people so far.  I hope to continue to cutlivate these relationships as the program goes on.  I also hope to contribute more to the community.
