# Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest Achievement

My biggest achievent in Mod 4 was probably making it all the way to the end without imploding.  Mod 4 has been easily the hardest module for me.  I've been battling with senioritis and have had a hard time juggling all of my responsibilities.  I'm happy to have made it as far as I did.  

## Biggest struggle

My biggest struggle is, as stated earlier, was trying to achieve some semblance of balance.  I felt very stressed about finding a job, and found myself devoting most of my time to finding a job.  I found that my schoolwork suffered because of this.  I did not feel good about my work, and did not feel as though I was reperesenting myself well as a student at Turing.\

## What sets me apart? 

I think that I am a unique individual that makes people feel comfortable.  I work hard at whatever I am applying myself to.  I don't know that these characteristics set me apart, but I know that these are things that I value about myself.

## Full stack experience

Mod 4 was instrumental in my understanding of the web, and how it works.  Before Mod 4, the backend was a magical mystery that returned data if I did things correctly in the front end.  Understanding servers and databases allowed me to make more informed choices in writing clean and concise code.

## Skillset

Turing has taught me how to learn.  Every step of the way I have never known the right path to take.  I have had to learn, fail, take stock, and repeat the cycle.  I have learned how to approach problems that I have no idea how to solve initially.  I feel that Turing has prepared me to be a lifelong learner.
