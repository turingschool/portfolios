## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

I really wanted to expand my knowledge of JavaScript and logical problem solving.  In Mod 1, I started to really enjoy the thought process behind writing code and I hoped to expand that in Mod 2.

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: _3_
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: _3_
* **C: Professional Skills**: _3_
* **D: Community Participation**: _3_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _3_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

Through my work on these projects, I have grown a lot.  My thought process when approaching large projects has become more refined, and I feel like I have become better equipped to tackle problems that I might not no the answers to right off the bat.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

This module I was not as monastic as I was in Mod 1.  Mod 1 was a lot of time figuring things out on my own.  This module involved a lot more collaborative problem solving through conversation, whiteboarding, and slack calls.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Sorting Suite surprised me.  I was initially overwhelmed at the thought of creating this sorting algorithm, but ended up really enjoying the process and learning a lot. It was a challenging project that took a lot out of me, but I think the way I went about it has helped me become a better programmer and problem solver.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _?_
* **Testing:** _?_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _?_
* **Functional Expectations:** _?_
* **Code Sanitation:** _?_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Similar to Sorting Suite, I greatly enjoyed the thought process that went into this project.  I think the greatest challenge for me was getting started.  Once I had a foundation to build out from, I fetl confident in my ability to complete the project.  Again, similar to Sorting Suite, this project helped me work on problem solving frameworks.  I thought through things systematically, and feel that my logical reasoning skills were developed through learning about Tries.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I think my group projects definitely helped me understand and solidify some concepts that we were working on.  Any group project has its own unique set of challenges.  I think I was able to move through these challenges through good communication and honest feedback.  Taking breaks is also important.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Jack Laird_
* **Game:** _Tron_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3+_
* **User Interface:** _3+_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed making something that people could use.  It was cool to be able to show this to people and have them interact with something I had created.  Collision detection was a really hard concept for me to wrap my head around at first and really had a hard time with it.  I feel better now, but had a hard time with it initially.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Ryan Harrington_
* **Spec Adherence:** _?_
* **User Interface:** _?_
* **HTML Style:** _?_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _?_
* **JS/React Style:** _?_
* **Testing:** _?_
* **Workflow:** _?_
* **Code Sanitation:** _?_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I think weathrly was a big challenge for me.  I missed the first React lesson and have been playing catch up since the beginning.  I have learned a lot and have really enjoyed React, but have been challenged from the jump.  I think this is a very valuable skill as it is used across the industry.  I feel comfortable that I will have more opportunities to practice in the coming module.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile Practices & Leadership_
  * _Feedback II_
  * _Feedback III_
  * _Storytelling II_
  * _Outreach & Networking_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

I think the Agile lesson was a really interesting and surprisingly informative lesson.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I think I have definitely become more comfortable giving and receivng feedback.  I feel prepared but feel there is still a lot of work to be done until I am truly a professional developer.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy & Privelege_
  * _Group Think_
  * _Mindfulness_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

The group think session was very informative.  It is nice to have a defense system against Group Think, which happens all the time at Turing.  I think Gear Ups and their quality largely depend on the quality of the conversation that happens in them.  I feel well equipped to have conversations about things that others may view as tough.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I feel much more a part of this community than I did in Mod 1.  Turtleneck Tuesdays was easily my largest contribution to this community and hope to continue to build community through creating weekly basketball games and being myself.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I think the biggest thing I need to review and continue to build is my knowledge of React.  I really enjoy React, but I feel like I am just scratching the surface when it comes to my knowledge of it.  I want to continue to learn more about it and am looking forward to honing my skills in Mod 3.  Over intermission week I plan to see my friends and play some basketball.
