# (Sage Vogt) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into mod 3 hoping to cement react and redux concepts as well as harden my good practices for git workflow and testing.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5
* **E: Community Participation**: 3.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I think I passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects include: 
* **SwapiBox**
* **PersonalProject**

#### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SageVanGogt/swapibox)

Swapibox was the first independent React project I worked on and I appreciated the opportunity to work alone and harden my React skills. Having complete control without input over a project of your own is daunting but rewarding in the end. 

##### Evaluator: Cody

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.

### Code Quality

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
* 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log#### Static Comp 1

#### FirstRide / Personal project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SageVanGogt/firstride)

##### Evaluator: Christie

### Completion

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* **HeadCount2.0**
* **MovieTracker**

#### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SageVanGogt/headcount2.0)

HeadCount2.0 was the first three person pairing project we worked on. We used react and made api calls while working on our prop drilling. The three person project dynamic was interesting and I think it was an overall productive way of working.

### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

Anytime I've discussed microaggressions in a group it's been easy to not take them seriousy. It was refreshing to open up the discussion and have serious commentary on the matter. This conversation left with me a much deeper appreciation for mindfulness when making remarks on others situations. 

#### code debugging the gender gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Group discussion during this session was moving and brought forth a lot of sentiment that is often left ignored in the community. It was an opportunity to discuss something that is not easily brought up. 

#### Mod 4 Leads

* [SelfDoubt]()

Self doubt is an immense issue at turing and for my generation in general. Being a young professional and taking yourself seriously can be scary and difficult. Seeing how other people experience it and handle it as well is comforting and useful for progressing and growing as a professional. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Working on SAB was a great experience and I was glad I had the opportunity to give back at least a little to the school that's given me so much.
