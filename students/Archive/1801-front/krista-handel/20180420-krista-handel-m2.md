## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? 
Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

My learning focus this inning was OOP, testing and React. Technical focus was on developing a deeper understanding
of higher-order functions, designing programs and testing programs. I wanted to develop my communication skills by 
learning technical vocabulary and by striving to collaberate more with others.


## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis 
(from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you 
plan to change?_

My individual work consisted of practicing higher-order function and accessing data from data structures. What was most
challenging was my failure in not reaching out more when getting stuck on solving something. Even though a solution was
found eventually, had I reached out I might have solved it sooner and then moved on to tackling a bigger problem.
I plan to continue working with objects and arrays and I intend to be more vocal about what trips me up.


### Study Habits
My study habits were 3-4 hours a night during the weekdays and, when possible, mostly all day on the weekends. 

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same?
Do your study habits serve you well?_

I noticed that I had to do more reasearch this inning. Concepts were introduced to us by demonstrating the basic 
functionality of each concept, and then we were released to explore and develop our own ideas. I tried my best to put
in the time and I learned the most when I collaberated with others.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare 
to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does 
it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed the struggle of understanding some basics of computer science. Sorting Suite was more focused on describing
and demonstrating your progress to one another, whereas GameTime was more about exploring the concept of OOP and Weatherly
was focused on using React. This project fulfilled my desire to learn more about designing programs.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 2
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 2
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your 
work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve 
your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete Me was where I gained more insight into data structures in computer science. It was challenging to think about
why arrays and objects were so powerful, but along the way it clicked that data structures make it easier for humans to
process and store data in a computer. This project really exercised my ability to demonstrate my process to others, and
through this I focused on using the correct terminology to better profess my understanding. By being able to show others
my process it will be easier for me to work with others in the future.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis 
(from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning?
What do you plan to change?_

My group projects helped me continue practicing my communication process by learning and applying new concepts
to our application. There were no challenges, I enjoyed working with my partners. I plan to continue to formulate
my process so that I can be a better collaberator. I would change of some of my working habits and should start 
seeking out mentors to help us out with difficult issues.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Cameron Buscher
* **Game:** Brick Breaker
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis
(from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed learning the concept of OOP by creating a game. It was easy to break out functionality into separate
classes because it was a game. It was a challenge to get the canvas to work with our JavaScript, but it all 
came together and it was very rewarding to see it all come together. I also enjoyed learning how to test. Good communication
made it easy to practice using my technical vocabulary and to practice describing my process to my partner.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Alan Charles_
* **Spec Adherence:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **HTML Style:** 3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve 
your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_ 

I enjoyed learning about React, stateful and stateless components, and about how passing data
and how the flow of events worked. It was a challenge to set up the test environment and get started
with testing, and in the future I plan to seek out help from mentors and others for advice with
how to structure tests in React. Working on a project with a completely new framework was difficult,
but by working together we were able to divide and conquer.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Feedback II_
  * _FeedbackIII_
  * _Storytelling II_
  * _Outreach & Networking_
  * _Agile Practices

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better 
prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_  

I learned that I'm becoming more comfortable with sharing my story and giving feedback, and that is important
to me because I am usually more comfortable with listening than speaking. I also enjoyed learning concepts about
the stack, which don't make much sense to me yet, but the more I develop the more this concept and others will
start to make sense. I would say I honed in my Learner skill because I'm always looking for different views on
concepts and my Connectedness skill gave me motivation to discuss concepts with others with the hopes of coming
together on ideas.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy and Privilege_
  * _Empathy & Privilege_
+ * _Group Think_
+ * _Public Data & Changing the World_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have 
conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having 
these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I think discussion is very important, and it doesn't always have to be technical. It is good to connect
with others based on mutual interests, but it is our individuality that is capable of innovation in the way
of development. It is important to build good relationships and therefore good environments. I'm always open
to discussion and am confident in my ability to converse with others about these topics in the future. 

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? 
in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I did not participate in the community as much as I would have liked to this inning. The most I could do
was offer help where I saw struggle and when others came to me directly. At this time I'm more confident in my
ability to assist others while tackling complicated tasks and I hope to offer more to the community next inning.

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission week? What are you looking
forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and 
reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I plan to revisit projects and see what I can improve upon. I would like to focus on React, testing React,
and I would like to read more Eloquent JavaScript and material on ES6. While I am confident in my knowledge of CSS, I
would like to gain more confidence in the design process by working on CSS puzzles. I'd also like to look into how
to handle api's better. To recharge I'd like to get a good amount of sleep each night, enjoy the weather during the day
and meditate. I could start looking into technical writing in order to reconnect with one of my longterm goals.

# Outcome:
Promote to Mod 3
