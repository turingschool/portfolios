# Jack Laird - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this mod was to solidify my use of array prototypes and fall in love with coding. Mod 2 doesn't focus as much on the front end which is what I fell in love with in Mod 1. The opprotunity to do some design in weathrly was really satisfying but complete me and sorting sweet pushed me in my understanding of objects and arrays. This is when I really started to enjoy programming. I believe that my understanding of when to use array prototypes and which on to use is solid.

* **E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I am really extroverted so working in groups is something that usually works well for me. I enjoyed getting to collaborate with other students on pseudocoding and then using what I learned and applying it to my code.

### Study Habits

I learned that I'm best at studying at home and that taking some time for myself before I get to work is really important for me. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I enjoyed sorting suite a lot, learning about how to make your code efficient was lesson that extends beyond sorting algorithms. It was really challenging for me to work without any visual representation. The biggest difference between complete me and weatherly is that you have to test your functions and all on the back end. Although they are both challenging because they introduce new concepts that you have to work through. This project made me really enjoy working with my code.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

Complete me was cool because of the application it had in apps I build in the future. This project really solidified my understanding of using objects and taught me the extents of what you can do with data types in javascript. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

I like working in groups which I think is going to be really beneficial in my future as a programmer. I need some work in communicating my expectations for how my partner and I will work throughout the project.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Seamus Quinn
* **Game:** Tron
* **Functional Expectations:** 3+
* **User Interface:** 3+
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 3

GameTime was the coolest project I had done at Turing. I never had a project that I could really show off. The most challenging part of this project was figuring out the first few concepts on how to animate the canvas and collision detection.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Megan
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

I really enjoyed working with react in this project. It was really nice to get back into the frontend and see my work. It was challenging working with react because it was a new concept. Passing props was hard for me at first but became really easy once I learned how to do it. 

## C: Professional Skills

**PD Sessions:**
 * _Agile Practices & Leadership_
 * _Feedback II_
 * _Feedback III_
 * _Storytelling II_
 * _Outreach & Networking_

I think the Agile lesson was a really interesting and really helped me deciding how to utilize my workflow. I think I have become more adept at giving meaningul and kind feedback. I feel more prepared for a professional environment but there's still room to improve to be a great member of a team.

 **Gear Up Sessions:**
 * _Empathy & Privelege_
 * _Group Think_
 * _Mindfulness_

The group think session was very helpful. It's important to not get hung up on ideas that are popular among your team.  I think the value I get from Gear Ups largely depends on the turn and talks i have during them. Turing does an amzing job of making me feel like I can talk about uncomfortable issues.
 

## Community Participation

This mod I was one of the leaders for pairing with mod 1 and also volunteered to be on the student advisory board. I really fell in love the turing community in mod 1 so taking a more proactive roll this inning.


## Final Assessment

I want to continue to practice my array prototypes and really solidify object prototypes. I also need to take some time to be outside and enjoy the good weather before I have to go back to the basement for 6 weeks. I hope to practice react as well because there are so many applications to it.

# Outcome:
Promote to Mod 3
