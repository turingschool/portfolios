# Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest Achievement

I really feel like I solidified my skills with Node this mod. I had a little expereince from my personal project in Mod 3 but im confident that i can write endpoints and test them fully! I actually really enjoy Node.

## Biggest struggle

My biggest struggle this mod was trying to balance everything. I got pretty stressed about the job search mid mod and kinda had a shutdown before I realized that getting the ball rolling made me feel a lot better, I'm excited to push myslef and find a job!

## What sets me apart?

I believe I have a good ability to connect with people and excel in collabortive environments. Includer and winning people over are actually my top two strengths from mod 1. I'm excited to find a place where I can use these skills to my advantage and help influence the culture at my company.

## Full stack experience

Mod 4 helped me understand how to structure a 1 to many relationship and how to create a backend! I feel confident in my ability to create a full stack application and using a backend that's provided to me.

## Skillset

Turing taught me more than I ever hoped. Not only did I learn the fundamentals of the front end, react, and node but some really key life skills. In high school I was always afraid of reaching out and seeming like I didn't understand the material. I was able to get away with not reaching out for a couple mods and then I was hit with swapi box, a project I did not do well with. Christie really deserves a lot of credit becuase she showed me that not only is it okay to search for help but that it can be a really rewarding experience. I am so thankful for everything I learned, Turing changed my life.
