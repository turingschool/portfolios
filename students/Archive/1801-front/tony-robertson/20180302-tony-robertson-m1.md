# Tony Robertson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module 1, I wanted to get a very strong foundation for HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. I also wanted to learn how to effectively work with others in paired programming and understand workflow with a version control system.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects were challenging and rewarding. Number Guesser was a great introduction to JavaScript. It provided a fair amount of struggle to overcome some of its obstacles. Also figuring out functional design concepts on how to handle additional features of the game that wasn't provided in the reference comp was fun. Static comp was a set of three static site layouts that we had to replicate to test our HTML and CSS skills. Static comp 1 and 2 for me were not much of a challenge so I pushed myself to implement features that required effort. Static Comp 3 was a massive hike in required time compared to 1 and 2 so I decided to do an exact replicate but still challenged myself with some JS functionality added.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is a small app I created that makes the user try and guess a randomly generated number from 1 to 100. If the user guesses correctly they are provided additional options to either increase the range by 10 on both ends or set their own range.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/tr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp 1 was an excellent exercise in using flexbox for the first time. I decided to recreate the site for my trip to Europe.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/tr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comp 2 was a very simple layout and I decided the cards aspect of it would be great to showcase characters from the game "Overwatch" I was able to implement a card-flip animation to reveal additional information about the character on the backside of the card.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/tr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)


Static Comp 3 was quite a challenge. It required a lot of time and had a decent amount of elements throughout the page. The graph section was particularly challenging. I decided to use a mix of grid and flexbox together which helped me a lot when going into setting up a responsive layout. I also saw some elements of the page that looked to collapse on button click so I implemented that with JavaScript which was fun and rewarding. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were 3 paired programming assignments with one other person. Every project built upon the knowledge you received in the previous one and added new challenges and features. ToDoBox was to take someone elses IdeaBox project and refactor the code as well as implement new features without removing any of their JavaScript structure.

#### Linked List

* [Linked List](https://github.com/tonyr729/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project was to provide the user with a site to enter and save their own bookmarks. This projects main focus is on DOM manipulation, specifically in creating elements dynamically.

#### IdeaBox

* [Linked List](https://github.com/tonyr729/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/idea-box.html)

This project was to create an app that could save ideas and vote on quality. The focus of this project was utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript and implementing localStorage and using JSON.

#### ToDoBox

* [Linked List](https://github.com/tonyr729/todo-box-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project was to create an app that could save a "ToDo" list that the user could vote on the importance and sort the list. This focus was being able to work in a codebase that is not your own, refactoring, and implementing new features the codebase.

## D: Professional Skills
This mod, we learned about Learning to Pair, Strengths and Storytelling, and Developer Identity.



### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Time box your work. If you are stuck more than 30min with something, go ask for help. This is something I have learned in the military, so it wasn't too much new info but learning about cognitive resources was valuable.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This one was the most memorable of all the gear-ups. It was great to see the diversity in all of mod 1 in the range of extro to introvert. Realizing that both go through the same emotions but just process it differently.

#### Managing Stress

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Stress management is something I stride in. During my military career, I was a resiliency monitor which meant I had to take special training in order to develop stress management seminars with my unit. Everything in this presentation was great information and delivered very well. Although I already knew the info I very much enjoyed the refresher.


#### Avoiding Burnout

* GitHub ULR N/A

The Mod 4 students did a great job leading this Gear-Up. The best thing I took away from this was to learn to love the process. No matter what goal you are trying to achieve, if you fall in love with the process of getting there rather than the outcome, you will be able to do anything.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended the meet-ups with not only my cohort but Turing wide as well. 
I volunteered to help with CodeFairs and other SAB events.
Helped with study sessions for my fellow classmates to solidify their knowledge with topics they struggled in.
Was extremely active in slack to answer questions and help with reminding my cohort of due dates.
Vigilantly kept an eye out for trash, dishes and other things that needed to be picked up around the school.
Overall tried to lift spirits of others and spread my enthusiasm for being at Turing.
