# TONY ROBERTSON - M4 Portfolio Presentation 

## Introduction:

This time last year I was in South Korea, wearing a full chem suit, flack jacket, gas mask, and helmet; in 102 degree heat and 70% humidity. Come November I separated from the Military, took a month to take care of all my belongings before applying and getting accepted for Turing. Losing no momentum in the whirlwind of my major life-changing event, in less than a month, I moved to Denver and began module one of the Front-End program. You can imagine how refreshing of a change it was going from drowning in my own sweat to learning how to code surrounded by amazing people in this beautiful city. Due to my past experiences, my resilience, discipline, and focus that I gained in the military, I was able to have a very positive growth mindset going forward with the challenges Turing presents to its students.

My favorite movie is Forest Gump and I have repeatedly thought of how similar my experience is to him getting out of the Military.

Once Forrest gets out of the Military he heads into the unknown as the challenging role of a fishing boat captain with no prior experience. Akin to me heading into the challenging world of software development, and Turing is the storm.

I continued to have a positive mindset throughout the storm. I thankfully never fell victim to imposter syndrome or doubt that I was going to succeed. I naturally took a leadership persona in my cohort that encouraged collaboration and community engagement in our slack channel. Promoting open discussions about our weaknesses and struggles that would strengthen us as a group of peers. I felt my experiences in the lower mods were all very positive. The challenges I faced in module two presented me with the best feedback for growth. I welcomed my weaknesses in over-engineering problems in stressful situations head-on and improved on my ability to communicate clearly and think logically in those situations and received feedback in module three that I was a pleasure to pair with and performed well.


## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
The largest achievement of module 4 was defining myself as a developer. I had discussions with an potential employer looking to fill a role that didn't quite work for me. This helped me define what I was truly interested in, which is to directly work on features that will be used by a client, this also helps me move forward in confidence of what to look for in a career.

Achievements technical wise I would have to say is successfully utilizing web sockets in my capstone. We have a client that wanted a specific feature in the product that we were able to achieve because of the dynamic updating available with web sockets.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
The thing that provided the most struggle was the House of Vars project where we were tasked to go into an open source codebase and try and resolve one of their issues. The reasons why this was so challenging not only the fact my team and I were not familiar with the code base, but the code was in a coding language we have never seen before. Challenge also lied in trying to set up their product locally on our machines to work with. Required dependencies, correct versioning, and environment set up all proved to be difficult. There were a lot of takeaways from the struggle provided in this project, one of the biggest is how important good documentation is when you have a complex codebase. The only reason why we were as successful as we were was due to their documentation and clear instructions. On top of all of that, it made me much more confident in being able to dive into a legacy codebase in the future.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
What sets me apart from my peers mirrors my biggest achievement of this module. Not only implementing WebSockets into our capstone but to do so because of a direct feature requested by our client. I also believe working for a client provides an experience that sets me apart from my peers as well.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
At the end of the third module, we are told we are fully hirable developers. While this is true, finally being able to make full-scale applications is what truly made me feel like I am a developer. I love the control and capability of being able to set up my own API gives me, and it reframed how I view the request/response cycle. And not only that but to deploy full-scale applications with the environment set up and continuous integration just makes me geek out so much. I would be happy taking a purely front-end role but I will definitely gravitate more to a full-stack role in the future.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Without a doubt, the skill I will take into my next job is being an adaptable engineer that not only knows how to learn but has the desire to. There is a popular saying that Turing doesn't teach you how to code, they teach you how to learn. In my final hours of being a student of Turing, I can attest to the truth in that saying. If someone came up to me before Turing and said "Hey I want to offer you a job but you will need to learn this complex programing language in a short timeframe, I would have quickly declined. But if the same situation happens tomorrow I would confidently accept knowing I can take on that challenge.
