# TONY ROBERTSON - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My learning focus this mod was on React, using API's, Canvas, and navigating complex data types. I also wanted to become more proficient in pseudocoding and developing a better process in approaching challenges. 

## Self-Evaluation
I feel like I did very well in all projects. I developed a good understanding for ES6 syntax, canvas, sorting algorithms, and react. In my opinion I did not start studying objects and arrays early enough. Having more time to work through complex datasets would have been benifical
going into mid mod assesment. I feel that I can still work on my process but feel confident in my ability to work through the data sets to get 
desired outcomes. 


* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Professional Skills**: 4
* **D: Community Participation**: 4
* **E: Final Assessment**: 2.5


-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work projects helped me understand sorting methods and the biggest take away was the use of recursive functions. The most challenging area was in sorting suite and trying to understand how the call stack works. Patterns I plan to continue with is to have good whiteboarding to break down problems using pseudo code to lay out steps on how to approach the problem. I plan to refine my process of working through more challenging problems to become more efficient.

### Study Habits

I noticed that my study habits this inning were still relatively the same, but the amount of time I spent on studying vs time devoted to projects and pairing was not balanced well. Early in the mod with Game Time and flowing into Sorting Suite my study time was spent only in the morning before class or at lunch. This was also limited due to pairing sessions with mod1. Looking back it would have been wiser to reserve some lunch and morning times for my self for study. It was only after coming out of mid-mod assessment that I noticed it was a problem and reserved more time for study.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I really enjoyed the logic behind sorting suite. Discovering the methods used and implementing them in code was rewarding. The recursive call stack was very challenging to try and visualize and implement.  But working together with other students in larger groups was a refreshing change of pace. Coming together to share concepts or approaches to a problem was valuable but then shifting back to working on a solution by yourself held a lot of value to me. This allowed me to work through the problem-solving process on my own without the influence of others mindset or approach so that I could develop my own.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3+
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

Complete Me was enjoyable. I enjoyed learning both binary and prefix tree methods and working through implementation of the suggested method was my favorite challenge. I continued to utilize the same process in approaching the problems. Heavily focusing on pseudocoding and A LOT of whiteboarding to tackle the logic and implementation. I do feel there was more group time spent whiteboarding with others on this project than sorting suite. Overall it helped in my goal of becoming stronger at whiteboarding.

## B: Group Work & Projects

Group projects this inning were wonderful. Both of my partners were amazing and I enjoyed working with them both. I feel that they gave me insight on different ways to approach a problem. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Sage
* **Game:** Winter Bells
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3+ (Code Sanitation isn't listed)
* **JS Style:** 3+ 
* **Workflow:** 3+

I love creation, so having a finalized game I made myself was very rewarding. With the amount of time we spent coding, an equal amount was spent on the whiteboard. The most challenging thing for me was perfecting collision detection and having gravity. There were a lot of challenges and abstract concepts to try and understand with Game Time, which really strengthened my problem-solving process.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Danilea
* **Spec Adherence:** 4
* **User Interface:** 4/3
* **HTML Style:** 4
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 4
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

I really enjoyed learning and working with React. Learning how to set up components and passing props came quickly and I loved how easy it was to utilize React to work with the DOM. With no surprise, testing React was by far the most challenging aspect of this project. But coming out of the project I feel much more confident in testing overall. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * [Outreach](https://gist.github.com/tonyr729/0e9f7d62f71697577e31418d38348302)
  * [Personal Story](https://gist.github.com/tonyr729/7398a9517e1fef311dcb77e5e5cb7992)
  * [Feedback](https://gist.github.com/tonyr729/2a88508d46d7f2482b2eeac719885f13)
  * [Agile](https://gist.github.com/tonyr729/20ee55e0064596b1096a2833d1d98f2f)
  

One of the things that I learned from PD sessions is that people are a lot more interested in my military background story that I would have assumed. After going through PD this inning (and having a pairing with Allison) I feel much more prepared for my future professional life as a developer.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * [Empathy & Privilege](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown)
  * [Group Think/Attention Economy/Tragedy of Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)
  * Mindfulness (M4 Lead Session)

I really found "group think" interesting. I find that it occurs very often in our society and has a lot of implication, both good and bad. I do find it important to have these conversations so that we can be aware of it and be mindful of how it affects different aspects of our personal and professional life. I enjoyed the mindfulness session as well and plan to keep practicing mindfulness in the future.

## Community Participation

While I continued to try and have an active role within my cohort I also took on pairings with mod 1 students with almost full availability. This was a great experience for me. I love to teach and to mentor. I've had several students message me and tell me that their pairings with me were extremely valuable.  I feel it was valuable on my end as well by allowing me to refresh my knowledge CSS and vanilla JS. I do feel looking back I should have had better time management with pairings and my own studies.

## Final Assessment

I plan to continue practicing objects and array problems on large data structures. I also plan to write my own for the additional challenge. I am looking forward to possibly having a personal project to work on next inning as I already have a project in mind. My plan for intermission week is to enjoy this nice weather and explore more of Denver which I haven't had a chance to do yet which will hopefully recharge my batteries.
