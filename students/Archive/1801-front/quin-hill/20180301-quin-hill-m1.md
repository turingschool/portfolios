# Quin Hill - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had no clear picture of what I had hoped to accomplish this Mod, but I think it's fair to say I surpassed it. I had gained some insight into coding through the prework and through some tutorials I had done on my own, but I judging how much I struggled with the javascript I had come across, I am very happy with what I have learned so far. I know I wanted to have a better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially how they tie together. I am pleased to say that I understand that now and I'm looking forward to learning much more.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

*https://github.com/quinhill/number-guesser
*http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a site that allowed the user to guess a number between 1 - 100. 

Stick to an organization system! Follow the checklists so that you don't skip a whole phase
Pay attention to the details
html
inputs - use aria label or label
work on naming things
that-is = results
nr-last-guess = last-guess

##### Functional Expectations

Evaluator: Pamela
Notes/What To Work On:
##### General
Be sure that both partners touch all areas of the project
##### Design/Comp Recreation
Responsive hold up pretty well across screen sizes
Comp recreation is pretty good
##### Git/GitHub
Good number of commits
Good job following commit conventions. Continue to push forward with using concise, descriptive commits
Should be a more even distribution of coding between partners
##### HTML
Add aria-label to inputs and form around search input
Ran it through a screenreader!!!
##### CSS
Nice organzation of files
Declarations organized alphabetically - consider idiomatic organization for other projects
Nice job using one media query for responsiveness
##### JS
Nice job using named functions for listeners
Naming for functions could use some work - hard to follow at times
Easy to read and follow code
Nice job with SRP
Be sure to understand the code that you find online for search functionality
else if not necessary in lines 110 and 124. Could just use else
Opportunities for refactoring upvote/downvote and editing for idea title and body
Functional Expectations
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.
##### HTML
Accessibility
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
##### CSS
Structure of Code
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
##### Implementation
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
##### JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Functions & Scope
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
##### Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
##### Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
##### DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
##### Style
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
##### GIT & GITHUB
##### Git
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
##### GitHub
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
##### DESIGN
##### Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
##### PAIRING
##### Collaboration
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

I took away quite a bit from this session, but didn't implement much of it. I have a past including long phases of depression and a drinking problem (3 years sober), so a lot of what was said are things that I have had to force myself to do before. what I found helpful was the reminder to take care of myself physically and mentally, so I could better meet the needs of this program.

#### Getting better at difficult things

*https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udbQS8rNQX0aM0dtxHerV30W7HGVGOcWfqOpDKVVcts/edit#slide=id.g2d1b090d8b_0_655

I found this Gear UP very interesting. I was intrigued by the concept of learning through repetition, rather than understanding. In a way, that describes my learning process here, because things just click after a while.
