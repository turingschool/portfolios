# Helen Dechat - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To learn as much as I can. Coming in, I was hoping to improve my ability to strategize and and plan a project, and increase my fluency in 'codespeak'. I improved slightly in both, but still have a long way to go. Technically, I learned a lot and feel like I have a good basic understanding of React.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I found the best practice for strategy and planning in Game Time. Sorting Suite was the most challenging in that, I became so obsessed with it, I ignored the other subject matter we were learning. I need to work on staying within my time-boxing boundaries.

### Study Habits

I did better time boxing last module falling into obsession spirals during this mod. But, for the most part, I feel like my study habits are working for me.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

I loved the algorithm challenge of Sorting Suite...too much(as noted above). I spent most of my time on Sorting Suite away from the group until I really came up against a wall. I always find it interesting and helpful, seeing how other minds interpret and solve a problem. On Insertion Sort, I spent the great majority of the time on pseudocode, whiteboarding, and then writing it out on paper in literal code. When I finally began to code in the text editor, I was so surprised at how quickly it came together.

### Complete Me

* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

The best part about Complete Me, was giving it purpose in Weathrly. My first big obstacle was interpreting the problem outside of the Linked List, Sorting Suite mindset and seeing it as a different data structure. A second major challenge was not wanting to steer toward a solution that I knew would be easier (simply setting the 'end of word' flag to the word itself) and stubbornly wanting to find a solution that stayed within my original design/intention (the 'end of word' flag should be a simple boolean). This was a good lesson in deadline, time-value, and compromise. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

The repeatable truth is that all experience is learning. With each partner I get to 'try on' a different process and learn different perspectives.

### GameTime
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/hdechat/game-time-2)
* **Partner:** Theresa Marquis
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3
* **Workflow:** 4

Theresa is a strong strategizer. I learned to use GitHub issues and to keep focus on the MVP. I liked the way our project progressed in a planned direction. It was fun and validating to be able to build a functional video game (that I used to play as a kid!).

### Weathrly
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcnamara14/weathrly)
* **Partner:** Tyler McNamara
* **Spec Adherence:** 3
* **User Interface:** 4
* **HTML Style:** 3+
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** 3+
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

In GameTime, the focus was on MVP functionality and design stayed rudimentary. With Weathrly, I learned from Tyler's process how a very clear design comp at the beginning can be a great map for function design, and in this case particularly with narrowing down data elements. I enjoyed playing with React, but, I continue to find testing with Enzyme and Jest confusing and hope to build my understanding of that testing utility. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**

* **Gear Up Sessions:**

  * Empathy & Privilege
    It's encouraging to hear how much interest there is in having these conversations. It is definitely a good start to reach for balance. But as the marginalized gain more recognition and voice, it's important to remember that empathy doesn't flow uphill easily; it is up to us stay away from bias and ensure that it flows in both directions.

  * Group Think/Attention Economy/Tragedy of Commons
    I found the conversations around Group Think most interesting, particularly the irony of being in an environment where group think is expressed in a positive way while discussing why group think is bad. Until ofcourse I learned that the working definition of Groupthink is different from what one would intuit group think to mean.

  * Your Smartphone is a Civil Rights Issue: Digital Privacy as a Developer
    I am very uncomfortable with exposure, so as a developer I will be be doing my best to protect consumer identity and rights. My larger concern with this issue is that information is valuable and can be considered a currency in itself. When services are provided for 'free', there's a tradeoff somewhere. If consumers want to continue to have access to 'free' apps, I do not have faith that their privacy will ever be truly respected.  
  
## Community Participation

I paired with a few Mod 1 students and enjoyed the interaction and the chance to help.

## Final Assessment

I will be working to gain instinctive fluency with array prototypes, immediate scope recognition, and understanding of the Enzyme testing suite. As always I look forward to learning new skills. I dramatically reduced my work hours this mod, so I will mostly be working during the break. But I will definitely be walking up a few mountains as well :)
