## A: End of Module Assessment




## B: Individual Work & Projects

I prefer to focus on functionality over design. These projects were very good exercises in keeping a balanced focus on both. I tried to create good pre-code planning habits. It's been going well. But the third challenge exposed some giant gaps in my method. Working with a few systems of responsive styling, I feel like I have a better understanding of how the elements relate to each other. Going forward, I will keep working on my pre-code planning. My goal is to be able to have a clear and complete understanding of what methods I want to use and why, how I want my class/variable names structured, and to be able to chart out my expected progress on a calendar.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hdechat/Turing-Projects)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. I enjoyed Number Guesser very much. And it is calling my name: 'Please refactor me!!'.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

 I discovered the limitations of HTML table. When it seemed like it would turn into a massive project to create responsiveness out of HTML table, I scrapped the code and switched to Flexbox.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

I continued learning to work with flexbox and began to understand why it is described as a good tool as long as you're only looking at a single vector.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

My first try with CSS Grid and building an SVG donut. I worked with both Flex and Grid on this comp. I was also very happy to have learned a very simple way to use the input:checked method to create buttons that toggle display/hidden areas. Although I started a week before deadline, and put in work daily, it was clear on the final two days, that I grossly underestimated the project time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

My favorite project was Pivot. I enjoyed learning from another person's perspective and alternative ways to accomplish a task.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [URL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udbQS8rNQX0aM0dtxHerV30W7HGVGOcWfqOpDKVVcts/edit#slide=id.p18)
Stress is a killer. This is not a metaphor. It was a vital and excellent talk on recognizing stressors and healthy ways to manage lifestyle to mitigate the effects. I struggle mostly with the simple things, like food preparation. I did pretty well out of the gate, but slid into frozen burritos by mid-mod, finishing off the last week with a few trips to the candy machine. New mod, new start :)

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)
I liked the video talk about perceptual learning as a fast route to mastery. Playing mythical creatures seemed like a good example of this style of learning. When I started playing I didn't understand what it was about. But immediate feedback shows correct or incorrect and I just kept plugging away. When I began the pairing projects, I immediately connected what I was trying to get from my code with the mythical creatures game. It was a very exciting 'Aha!' moment.

#### Mod 4 Leads: Learning Through Teaching

It was a good talk for me. I have had no previous experience with mentors and I am uncomfortable reaching out. Hearing the positive experiences people have had as both mentors and mentees was encouraging. During the exercise, I noticed that when 'teaching' the information from the article I read, I was mostly relaying my interpretation of what I thought the writer was trying to convey, rather than teaching the pure straight facts. I realize that it was my way of trying to provide the 'juice' of the information. But I should stay mindful that it might affect the listener's opportunity to make their own unique critical assessments of the information.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I made a lot of coffee.
