## A: End of Module Assessment

passed  

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects
With these two projects I was able to gain more understanding of the benefits and flexibility of React. With SwapiBox, I learned that I need to spend more time planning the organization of the app architecture and wireframing my components. I focused on improving test writing and keeping an organized file structure.  

With my personal project, my goal was to do pure tdd style coding, consistently submit microcommits, and have a thoroughly mapped out wireframe of the state-tree and file structure before beginning the project. I was able to keep strictly on point for the most part, but fell off path a bit when I was working with local storage and saga structure, and with css styling. I learned why it's particularly important to have solid styling wireframes with modular code structure.  

#### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hdechat/swapibox)  
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)  

This React project uses the Star Wars API and requires a little more complexity than previous projects, including nested fetches and resolving arrays of promise objects.

#### 7 Day Menu Planner

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hdechat/7-Day-Menu-Planner)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Having struggled with pairing projects, I found these projects to be a lot more fun and allowed a little practice with rebase.

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/headcount2.0)  
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)  

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/valentinovtino/movie-tracker-front)  
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)  

This React project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies.  It includes a repository that serves as the "backend", allowing connection to Postgres.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

We need to focus on recognizing and promptly confronting microaggressions. Remembering that we are all perpetrators and victims of microaggressions can help us maintain our calm and objectivity. It is vital to understand that the person who feels targeted has the prevailing perspective.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

I'm disappointed and rather irritated that this is still an issue. I'm a woman and I'm 'older'. I've been naive about these discriminations maybe because like one of the women interviewed in the movie, my gen-x peers experienced a more gender-equal mindset. 

#### Mental Health

I learned about apps that help people manage their depression. It's good to know that there are people focused on creating apps that help with mental conditions. I think it shows that the stigma attached to mental/emotional struggle is beginning to fade.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I continued to make lots of coffee. I also started the dishwasher once.
