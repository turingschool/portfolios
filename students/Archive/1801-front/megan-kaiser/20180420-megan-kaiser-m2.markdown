# Megan Kaiser - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

As always, my primary focus was to learn as much as I could while deeply understanding my Javascript. If I found any particular code difficult during class I would dissect it in complete detail afterwards. I focused on the finer points of my coding so extensively in order to build my self-confidence up. While I certainly have room for growth in my confidence levels, they have improved greatly overall throughout this mod compared to mod 1. I feel much more assured of my programming abilities a as a result, and I have a clear plan for continuing to completely eradicate any self-doubt (see Final Assessment). This includes leading several iron-fe sessions during mod 3, as well as finishing building a new mythical-creatures that focus on female leads.

## Self-Evaluation

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: _3+_
* **B: Group Work & Projects**:  _3_
* **C: Professional Skills**:  _4_
* **D: Community Participation**: _3_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _3_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects 

Overall, I found working through Sorting Suite and Complete-Me alone extremely beneficial to identifying both my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer. Specifically, these projects helped me recognize that pseudo-coding was an area of weakness (which I have greatly improved at since) and array prototypes were a significant strength. I found these individualized projects to be both the hardest and most fulfilling aspects of this mod. In mod 3 I will continue to master pseudo-coding through extensive self-study and iron-fe, while perfecting my array prototypes.

### Study Habits

My study habits changed greatly this mod, with a focus on solo practice that involved a significant time investment outside of Turing. One change that paid major dividends  was practicing array prototype everyday throughout the mod on my own, which absolutely gave me more confidence in my code. I also continued reading the lesson plan the night before class (as I did the last mod), and recognize the benefits from this preparation each day in class. My study habits have definitely served me well throughout this mod.


### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:**  Pass

The challenge and joy of Sorting Suite WAS the same thing: working on the project alone. I was able to quickly solve insertion sort all by myself, with greatly boosted my self-confidence and improved my overall coding skills as a result. Specifically, Sorting Suite helped me master array prototypes so much that they are a clear area of strength for me.

### Complete Me

Scores are not posted as of 4/18/2018 9pm

* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_

I really like that Complete Me is such a valuable tool for presenting my portfolio to future employers, especially because it allows me to demonstrate that I understand how to make a npm package. I found combining the binary and linked lists to be challenging initially, but after working through the problem I feel strongly that I understand the underlying concepts well and can explain them in a future job interview. Overall, Complete Me has and will continue to be very helpful in both refining and presenting my coding skills to employers.

## B: Group Work & Projects

Overall, I found this mod’s group work and projects to be a valuable lesson for my future career in tech. My partners weren’t very willing to consider my perspective or listen to my points (despite extensive research on my part), and the value I gained from them suffered as a result. Learning how to assert myself when a partner isn’t taking my points into consideration was a major challenge, but in the end I was successful in making my voice heard. In the future I will be much more vocal and not allow myself to be railroaded by partners.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Camilo Snapp_
* **Game:** _Connect Four_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:**  _3+_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _2_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:**  _3_

GameTime completely cemented my understanding of OOP and ES6, which I enjoyed greatly. I now have a deep understanding of how to use these concepts successfully in a project. Although the most challenging aspect of GameTime was solving the equation for diagonal win, it helped me understand recursion much better than before.This project was the hardest I have faced at Turing, but my future goals of working in tech are well-served by knowing how to properly use OOP programming.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Jack Laird_
* **Spec Adherence:** _Pending_
* **User Interface:** _Pending_
* **HTML Style:** _Pending_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _Pending_
* **JS/React Style:** _Pending_
* **Testing:** _Pending_
* **Workflow:** _Pending_
* **Code Sanitation:** _Pending_

Weathrly made learning React very fun and easy for me. The biggest challenge it presented was learning to do my first API fetch, although that was also the most rewarding aspect of learning Weathrly. I truly believe understanding React well as a programmer will allow me to always be employable, and so Weathrly is very beneficial to my future goals, both as a student and a professional.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices
  * Feedback 2
  * Feedback 3
  * StoryTelling 2
  * Networking 

I learned the value of focusing on my Turing story in my PD session, which I found surprising. Considering the fact that I sold my car and quit my job to attend this program, I want to be able to express my Turing story in a concise and effective manner that fully utilizes its power. Another thing I found very surprising was how many companies still employe the waterfall effect when launching a new product. The PD sessions taught me how to better seek out potential mentors and job interviews, which I am very excited to use right away in mod 3. Overall I feel like the PD session gave me some additional insights that will serve me well in my future career.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy & Privilege
  * Group Think
  * Public Data & Changing the World

I found learning about group think during Gear Up very surprising, as I wasn’t familiar beforehand with the concept. I do find the Turing community often employs group think for the positive, and feel such conversations are critical to my success at Turing.I am well-equipped to continue having them in the future, both as as student and then as a professional.

## Community Participation

Overall, my community participation was very strong this mod. Early in the mod I opted into the community in a deeper way than ever before when I stepped far out of my comfort zone and began building creatures for the next mod one group. Additionally, my cousin works in HR at a video game company and is going to finally start sending me job postings for the job-hunt channel, which will hopefully benefit our Turing community. I really feel like a part of the downtown Denver ecosystem as a Turing student who lives in the area, and I tell everyone about Turing and Try Turing weekends. I found the deeper level of engagement both very enjoyable and illuminating.

## Final Assessment

WORK ON MY SELF-CONFIDENCE!

I have a detailed plan to better manage stress in mod 3, with a specific focus on managing the stress of end of mod evaluations.

I am also going to set up as many coffee dates as possible to build my confidence up even more for interviews. Although I have struggled with self-confidence at times throughout my Turing journey (despite knowing I am well-able to do all the tasks necessary to be successful both at Turing and in the workforce), I am and will continue to work extremely hard each day to growth my self-belief. I will be using growth mindset to accomplish this.

Before the start of mod 3 I will also be extensively practicing array prototypes and redoing all of my projects in React. Although I feel strongly that I understand React well overall, I will continue to refine and practice my skill in it till I reach a deeper level of mastery. I am also going to spend time packaging my connect four game so I can show it off on my resume.
