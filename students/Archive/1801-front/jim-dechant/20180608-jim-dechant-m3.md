# Jim Dechant - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to get a better understanding of React, Router, and Redux. I also wanted to leave this module feeling prepared to look for work. I had heard that this was an incredibly busy and stressful module so I wanted to take care of my mental health and wellness as well. Aside from the stress of the mod, many have also said this was their favorite mod and I looked forward to experiencing all the joy and struggles of Mod 3.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work of this mod was very challenging and rewarding. I struggled a lot on each of these projects, but I also came out of each project with a better understanding of the technologies I was using each time.

#### First-Trip

* [First-Trip](https://github.com/Ecksi/first-trip)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. For my project, I wanted to help out of state visitors select the right strain of marijuana so that they could have the most enjoyable experience and also know the laws of this state so that they don't encounter any unneeded troubles.

**Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

**CSS/Design**

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

**Code Quality**

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

**Redux Architecture**

* 3.5: All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

**PropType Implementation**

* Pass

**README Updates**

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running

**Code Sanitation**

* 4 - Zero complaints

**Testing**

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

**Workflow**

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### SwapiBox

* [SwapiBox](https://github.com/Ecksi/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Our first solo project. A deeper dive into React, and making API calls as well as an introduction to Router. I learned some big lessons on this one with SASS. Due to a silly mistake, I came to my evaluation with no styles on the page, but I came out of the evaluation with a valuable lesson learned.

**Specification Adherence**

* 1 - The application is missing multiple features essential to having a complete application.

**Code Quality**

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

**CSS/Design**

* 1 - Developer did minimal to no CSS for this project besides what was indicated in the comp.

**Testing**

* 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

**PropType Implementation**

* Pass

**README Updates**

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running


**Code Sanitation**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group work was very fun this module, our first venture into 3 person groups and git rebase, it was awesome to see how we have all progressed since mod 1 and to be able to utilize different strengths of each member.

#### HeadCount

* [HeadCount](https://github.com/Ecksi/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

The first group project of the mod, I enjoyed working with a group of three and finally jumping into git rebase. This was a great project for diving into React and setting the pace for this module.

**Specification Adherence**

* 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

**Code Quality**

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

**CSS/Design**

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

**Testing**

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

**PropType Implementation**

* Pass

**README Updates**

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running


**Code Sanitation**

* 4 - Zero complaints

**Workflow**

* 3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### Movie-Tracker

* [Movie-Tracker](https://github.com/Ecksi/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Redux, Router, React we just learned all three technologies and had a great project to dive into to get a better understanding of these new technologies. I especially liked this project because I had a wonderful partner who helped improve my understanding of testing.

**Specification Adherence**

* 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

**Code Quality**

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

**CSS/Design**

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

**Testing**

* 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

**PropType Implementation**

* Pass

**README Updates**

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running

**Code Sanitation**

* 4 - Zero complaints

**Redux Architecture**

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

**Routing**

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

**Workflow**

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

- [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

  This was a good gear up for Mod 3, as we were put into a very stressful 6 weeks; emotions and tension tend to increase. This was a great gear up to prepare for this and prevent and recognize microaggressions as a cohort, in groups, and in our future careers.

- [Code Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

  I recognize the importance of this gear up, but by this time I had seen this video three times. I still think it is an important gear up and something we as developers so remember and try to keep in mind as we move forward in our careers. 

- Self Doubt

  The Mod 4 lead gearups, I think these are always fun to attend and look forward to leading a session with a group next module. I enjoyed the small group sessions we did in this group and the big take away was in order to combat self-doubt one first needs to realize the things they are doubting then they can improve on those things.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

  I continued to pair with the modules below me and was able to pair with our sister cohort to help them as they started diving into javascript and fetch calls. As a cohort, our community grew even stronger and spending time with my fellow cohort mates was immensely rewarding this module.

------------------
