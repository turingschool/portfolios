# Cameron Buscher - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to step up to a new level of personal skill with javascript as a whole, and the tools we were learning, including React, Redux and Router. I think my manipulation of all three skills really solidified my passion for coding and my excitement in my ability to create things of my own design.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

My main takeaway from this gear up, which was led by Leta, was to just be more aware of my surroundings and what people are subjected to, and also be aware enough to not be a microaggressor. Just being empathetic to others and watching out that this community is treated as well as it should be.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

A fairly tragic gear up, the content is just painfully sad and real. It's unfortunate that an industry that brands itself as very forward-thinking and open is often trapped in paradigms that shouldn't even exist anymore. Some classmates opened up about their struggles, and this gear up will stick with me through my career.

#### Mod 4 led gear up

About the benefits and negatives of the apps we create as they pertain to mental health. Big takeaway is that it's just a spectrum. Something could be really unhealthy for me but have a profound impact on your life. Again, just be aware of what people are going through.


## E: Community Participation & Playing a part

My biggest contribution to the community this mod is just being there for the mods below me but also my classmates. Being available to pair with people who are struggling with a concept and help them think about things differently was a big boon to my learning.
