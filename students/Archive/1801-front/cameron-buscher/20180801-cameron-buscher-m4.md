## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I feel like I've had a good process with my job search. It hasn't had gotten me a job yet, but I really like my process and the results I have had. 

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

This mod was really interesting for me on a personal level. I had a lot going on that forced me to focus my time. This pushed me to timebox rigourously and focus on the right things at the right time.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I always press the buttons on the keypad to get into class, even if the door is open. This is a nice humorous tick.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I think I'm really excited to learn more in back end technologies. I think I could fit in anywhere in the stack, and always have felt that. BUT now I feel like I could enjoy any position I get, which really excites me. I'm excited to know how these things that I work with so often actually function.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Learning to utilize the people around me as a resource first. Turing has taught me more than anything that asking people for help is not shameful or bad, but often a smart first step. I really learned from my cohortmates, and feel extremely lucky to have learned alongside such great people for seven months.
