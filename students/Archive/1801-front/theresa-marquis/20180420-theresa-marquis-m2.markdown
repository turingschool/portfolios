# THERESA MARQUIS - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

_My learning focus this mod was to learn React to a level sufficient to be admitted to Mod3.  Specifically, I hoped to improve my elocution of technical terms, such as 'assign by value' vs. 'assign by reference'.  I certainly have better understanding and can speak to specific coding jargon with more knowledge now._

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_I developed a stronger pattern of independence in my learning this Mod.  I think that pattern will serve me in all future code-learning.  I did also try to be a good partner, and support my partner's learning in paired projects.  When paired programming is at its best, it is a great learning experience.  I was able to enjoy such a paired partnership this mod and hope to reproduce that experience in future pairing/learning opportunities._

### Study Habits

_My habits of studying serve me well enough.  My neuro-plasticity is weaker than I would wish.  I have identified that, sadly, I am not an auditory learner.  I benefit much more from reading material and then practicing the coding.  That may work to my advantage as less of my learning is from instructor-led and more comes from my independent study._

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? Sorting suite exposed me to the 4 primary sorts in the Turing curriculum. I expect to be able to revisit the different sorts when I prepare for technical interviews.  They are also an area to learn about optimization formally using Big-O concepts._

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _3_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _3_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **Code Sanitation:** _3_

_I appreciated the challenge of the radix-trie.  It was something different on which to practice algorithmic thinking.  The challenge was simply breaking the psueudo-code into small enough pieces to be able to code it.  Also, I did not sufficiently work out the code to determine if recursion or a while loop would be the next step.  I really enjoyed reading about regex, which online radix-tries utilize. The implementation of testing along with the algorithmic thinking practice were a very worthwhile challenge to tackle._

## B: Group Work & Projects

_The most challenging aspect of the group work was a bit of an arms race/competition that seemed to develop in Game Time.  It was an odd experience in what was meant to be a paired project.  I have concluded that distributed work on a project can make communication a bigger challenge and is something to be vigilant about.  Weatherly was a nice challenge and my partner was excellent.  Pair coding can be very rewarding.  I will continue to keep project work focused on the learning as the highest priority, mine and my partner's._

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Helen Dechat_
* **Game:** _Frogger_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _4_

_In GameTime I enjoyed working in the canvas and seeing the inheritance from a base class by other classes.  The distributed pairing was challenging and oddly competitive. Inheritance between classes and practicing some of the iteration methods_

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_
* **Spec Adherence:** _3_
* **User Interface:** _3_
* **HTML Style:** _3_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _3_
* **JS/React Style:** _3_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_The most enjoyable part of Weatherly was learning about testing and implementing working tests. Learning about control components vs the ref attribut avaiable in React was also very interesting.  Passing props and considering the use of an IIFE was challenging and fun._

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile Practices_
  * _Feedback 2_
  * _Feedback 3_
  * _StoryTelling 2_
  * _Networking_

_I was a little surprised to learn that 4 out of 5 of my stregth fall into the strategic category.  I hope to get better use of the talent as I go forward._

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Empathy & Privilege_
  * _Group Think_
  * _Public Data & Changing the World_

_I enjoyed the discussion around group think the most.  It is useful to think about the nuances of human interaction and discuss when is group think different than simple self-preservation an when can it potentially lead to immoral behavior._

## Community Participation

_I always want to be a contributor to the community.  This mod, I mostly contributed by being supportive of classmates who were anxious and needed a sympathetic ear or hug._

## Final Assessment

_I will complete the pre-work for Mod3.  I will spend some time in quiet rest and relaxation.  I am resolved to be ready for the 80 hours per week that Mod 3 will require._

# Outcome:
Promote to Mod 3
