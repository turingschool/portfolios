## Summary of my Presentation:

Picture this: A man from Nebraska walks into a school for software & design with no prior coding experience or knowledge. He’s pretty sure that he can do this, but his entire journey he will wrestle with questions of whether or not he’s smart enough to actually pull it off. This is his first GitHub repo. Please direct your attention to the SINGLE commit where I…I mean ‘he’…pushed the entirety of his code.

Throughout Mod 1 he built his skills while building some simple apps. He put in an insane amount of work every week and was able to make it through the mod relatively unscathed. Still, he felt like most of his peers in his cohort were smarter than him.

His lowest point of Turing comes the Tuesday after being assigned sorting-suite, a project in which he is required to write multiple sorting algorithms. This day will forever be known as the most blackest Tuesday. While he understands the algorithms well enough, he doesn’t really understand recursion or the call stack and he spends 8 hours figuring out how to NOT write merge sort, an algorithm which will total a mere 30 lines of code once he figures it out. He is pretty sure it’s impossible. He is pretty sure he doesn’t understand coding at all. He codes through dinner. He’s questioning his life choices. He’s questioning his existence. He goes home and probably cries himself to sleep. But for some reason, he doesn’t give up.

Then, the clouds parted and Mod 3 arrived. He got comfortable with React and Redux. He was able to implement Router in his project as an extension on the same afternoon he learned it. He even worked his butt off to become really solid at testing, including the notoriously difficult asynchronous testing. Finally, he could do the thing!

And just as he was feeling comfortable with all of the things, he was introduced to back-end programming. Back-end programming is just like front end programming…if your computer didn’t have a screen. You’re apparently creating tables and endpoints, but you can’t actually SEE them, so you just have to imagine them or whatever. 

### Back-end isn't as bad as I thought
Because of months of programming under my belt?
Nice to be able to create whatever endpoint you need to get the data you want.
Not scared of back-end
Would consider a full-stack roll

### Biggest achievement / what sets me apart
Capstone was my biggest achievement. We did some cool stuff with it, like implement websocket, cool animations, pop-out video, etc.
The reason this sets me apart is because we did it for a client:
Made changes based on their feedback along the way
Implement features they wanted added
It was a great experience to have

### Struggle
Turing is a struggle
Throughout my entire time here I’ve struggled 
But I’ve become comfortable with the struggle
So much so, that I can barely think of a struggle I had
I had an issue over the weekend setting up TravisCI because I put the .travis.yml file in the wrong folder. Does that count?
It’s funny, because the struggle used to be so frustrating, not I just see them as challenges.

Our cohort has always been close and vocal, now slack is oddly silent. We’ve all learned to fix almost all the problems ourselves.

### Most impoartant lesson
Every week of Turing I did something I didn’t know how to do, but I was able to figure it out.
When talking to my partner about implementing a feature into our project and wondering if we could do it, I realized, oh, we can do it. It’s a thing that can be done, we just don’t know how to do it yet.
There are still a lot of things I don’t know how to do, but it’s only a matter of time and desire to learn them.
