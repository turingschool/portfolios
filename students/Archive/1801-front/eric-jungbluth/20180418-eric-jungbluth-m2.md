# Eric Jungbluth - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My big goal this inning was becoming comfortable with manipulating objects and using array prototypes. I attended every session of iron-fe and put in a large number of hours working with them on my own, and I feel like I've done a good job. I also feel like I significantly improved my project workflow by using Asana (a task managing website) to keep myself organized, which is one of my weaknesses.

## Self-Evaluation

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 4
* **E: Final Assessment**: 3.5
-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects
My individual work outside of class undoubtedly helped me with my areas of emphasis. In addition to attending every iron-fe session, I spent 10 hours over the course of one of our "free" weekends just practicing array prototypes. With the exception of one exceptionally low point during Sorting Suite, my projects all went fairly well. I plan to continue to use Asana next inning (a task managing website) to keep myself organized. One thing I would like to do is actually learn how to use it better, so I can utilize functions beyond just the "to do list" aspect of it. 

### Study Habits
The one big thing I did differently this inning was coming in before class to study. On days when I needed to be in at 8:00 for iron-fe, I would get up at 4:30 so I could run, shower, eat, make my lunch, and catch the train. It was difficult, but I feel that iron-fe was totally worth it. Since I assume Mod 3 is only going to be more difficult, I plan to continue to put in the extra hours needed to succeed at Turing. I also realized last inning that I don't study well at home because I get distracted, so staying late every night was helpful in getting my projects done on time.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

Unfortunately, the only thing I enjoyed about Sorting Suite was learning how the sorting algorithms worked. Spent a couple hours on Sunday before the project kickoff going over them, and it was incredibly helpful to already understand how they worked when I started the project. The Tuesday night of Sorting Suite was my lowest point of Turing, thus far. Thankfully a few of us got an extra lesson about recursion and the call stack from Jon Sweet, and when we came in the next day we were able to knock out both merge sort and quick sort. Getting a grasp on recursion and the call stack was definitely the most challenging part of that project. Working together on Sorting Suite was interesting because it was more free-flowing, so you could learn from multiple people and choose to work with those who seemed to be heading in the same direction you were. Although I didn't enjoy the project, I know that it's incredibly important for me to understand sorting algorithms, recursion, and the call stack for job interviews, and I definitely feel more comfortable with them now.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 4
* **Testing:** 4
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 4
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **Code Sanitation:** 4

Learning about tries was interesting. I sort of ended up pairing with Tony on this project and we did a great job of whiteboarding our way through it. This project felt a lot easier than Sorting Suite because my struggle there helped prepare me for the abstract thinking needed for the trie. I also think the whiteboarding was instrumental in helping us understand what was going on in our code. While not exactly fun, it did give me a good understanding of tries, and it was cool to see that the code I wrote and tested worked flawlessly in Weathrly.

## B: Group Work & Projects
Both of the group projects were really fun this mod! Gametime was incredibly helpful in improving my workflow (one of my areas of emphasis), especially because I was paired with Daniela, who is incredibly organized. It also helped me understand classes and the interactions between parent and child classes. Weathrly was a great introduction to react. Unfortunately, neither one of them helped too much in improving my understanding of array prototype methods (another one of my areas of emphasis). I'd say either dealing with canvas or testing React was the most challenging. I definitely plan to continue my newfound organizational skills for the next inning. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Daniela Carey
* **Game:** Frogger
* **Functional Expectations:** 3
* **User Interface:** 4
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3+
* **Workflow:** 4

GameTime was a fun way to start the inning! Dealing with canvas was a pain in the ass, but once we got past it the rest of the project was great. It was a great way to learn how to use classes and inheritance, as well as how to write code that spanned multiple files. Daniela and I worked really well together, and it made me realize the importance of being a good partner, especially since it was a longer project. Daniela taught me about Asana, which I have continued to use, and will continue to use in the future. 

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Stephanie Ospina
* **Spec Adherence:** 3
* **User Interface:** 3+
* **HTML Style:** 3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 3+
* **JS/React Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Workflow:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

I don't know if it was because react was new to us or because we started by cloning down the repo instead of doing install-react-app, but so much about this project was challenging. I'd say the most challenging thing was the testing. It was tough to know what to test and how, exactly, to test it. I do feel I have a better understanding of how React works, how to pass props, and how to make a fetch call. I was also able to make those array prototype skills come in handy when cleaning the data, even if it was only using .map(). 

## C: Professional Skills
* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile reflections
  * Professional story
  * Outreach
  * Feedback II
  
  I think that the most interesting PD session was the Outreach session. That's the skill that I think will most help me in my professional life after Turing. From what I understand, outreach is going to be instrumental to me getting a job once I've finished the program. I also think the professional story session will come in handy, and it has definitely helped me think about what things I should include in that story when I have a short amount of time to share it with someone. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy
  * Groupthink
  * Mindfulness
  
  I think the most interesting thing I learned is that everyone has struggles that they deal with, even the people in my cohort who seem to just "get" coding. It's definitely important to have conversations like those we had in our Gear Up sessions, as it makes for a better workplace. I do feel like I have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future, but to be fair, I've always been comfortable with communication.

## Community Participation
I'd say my community participation was vastly improved from last inning, but I also had more opportunities. I was able to lead a few of the Mythical Creatures sessions we held for Mod 1 over lunch. I also had at least two pairings a week with Mod 1 students, with my highest week having four pairings! I also jokingly offered to teach one of their sessions when we had some work time one afternoon, and Pam let me teach them about .filter(). In addition, I stepped up one day and led iron-fe because no one from Mods 3 or 4 showed up. 

## Final Assessment
I definitely want to practice/strengthen my React skills over the intermission week. I know that React is a huge part of Mod 3, so I want to be as prepared as possible. I'm looking forward to React and all of the apps we'll be making in Mod 3 with it. To recharge, I want to catch up on some sleep and go on some trail runs to recharge over intermission week. 

# Outcome:
Promote to Mod 3
