# Daniela Carey - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Going into this mod, I set out to get a better understanding of basic front-end web development skills so that I could continue to build on that foundation throughout my time at Turing. My goal was to focus on learning rather than just passing so that I felt confident in my skills before moving into Mod 2. To help accomplish this goal, I challenged myself to stay committed to my health and wellness by working out consistently and getting enough sleep.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects were a fun challenge and a way for my own personality to come out in the design and overall decisions that went into building them. Since we typically had group projects happening at the same time, these projects often served as a "break" from the group work and a time for me to zone in and focus with less distractions. I also felt these were a good challenge for me since I didn't have a partner to help problem-solve.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/ds-comp-challenge-1)
* [GitHub Page](https://danielafcarey.github.io/ds-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For Static Comp 1, I used my creative license on the comp to create a country profile on Haiti. I wanted to design something that could be a functional product, so I designed this page to be part of a database that has a similar profile on all countries. The site is responsive on desktop as well as mobile and I loved designing a clean mobile view from scratch since that was not layed out for us in the comp. 

I started trying to use flexbox for this comp and after it became more of a headache than a design help, I decided to scrap it and redo the project using grid. I liked grid much more and felt my comp was more successful because of this pivot. 

Feedback I received on this project was that my image was too big when resized to mobile. I also should have adjusted the spacing/font sizes of the header text and aligned my button icons with my button text better. Overall, the feedback was positive, specifically good feedback regarding the layout of my mobile view with the heading box overlayed on the background image.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/ds-comp-challenge-2)
* [GitHub Page](https://danielafcarey.github.io/ds-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For Static Comp 2, I again wanted to design something that could be a functional product, so I created a Turing "directory" to be used as a way to connect with other Turing students & staff. The site has a profile card for students with relevant links and info related to their Turing career. This was almost like a "Private Facebook" that was specific to this organization and in the context of web development in regards to the content and functionality of the page.

Feedback I received on this project was to consider a max-width on the page so that it was closer to the comp layout. The way I designed it allowed for many cards to be added on the page and for each card to fill in as one long row as long as the screen width would allow. Sticking closer to the comp (4 cards per row) could have been better UI for large screens. I also could have switched to the small mobile view at a greater width to avoid an unnecessary media break with the nav links. Overall, I received positive feedback, specifically on my very simple heading-bar on mobile view.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an app that generates a random number between 0 and 100 and allows a user to try to guess that number. The app will give feedback on the users' guesses until they guess the right number and then the user can play again. Alternatively, the user can enter their own range to guess from and the app will generate a random number between that range.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The best part about the group projects was how much I learned from my partners. Group projects, while sometimes requiring more time to complete, bring in two great minds and skillsets and gave me the opportunity to learn new skills, methods, and techniques that I may not have been exposed to if I were working alone. Additionally, I loved problem-solving with my partners because you have double the brain-power. 

---

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For this project, we created an app that allowed a user to store links in a list. The user could add a title, mark the links as read, and delete them. The app also showed the user the total counts of links, unread links, and read links. I learned a lot from Tyler on this project with CSS and this was right about the time we were learning jQuery, so we were able to get our feet wet using a little jQuery. Tyler and I were able to finish all phases of the project and add a few small UI improvements (2 columns of link cards on wide-screens). Additionally, we both became more comfortable with the git/github process by struggling through it for this project.

##### Partner: Tyler McNamara

##### Notes/What To Work On:
###### html
* nice work using aria labels
* great naming conventions
* default to using classes instead of ids for reusability
###### css
* 0 not 0px
* consider adding organizational comments for each page component

* consider loading only one style sheet in the head and import all others
###### js
* No need for most comments
* Try leveraging parameters and arguments in place of global variables
* Think in terms of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function name should say exactly what the function does.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox is an app that takes a user's input of an idea title and idea and puts it into a list to store for the user. Each idea can have a quality that the user can change from the idea card and a delete button to remove the idea from the list. This was our first project that used local storage, so it was definitely a challenge to figure out how to implemenet that. The best part about this group project was problem-solving with my partner. We did miminal work separately and mostly worked side-by-side so it was helpful to have to talk through problems out loud as we tried to solve them. 

##### Partner: Jack Laird
##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster

##### Functional Expectations
* Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

##### HTML
###### Accessibility
* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
use aria-label for input elements / buttons
###### Style
* Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

##### CSS
###### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
###### Implementation
* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
look into using vendor prefixes for transition e.g. -moz-, -webkit-

##### JAVASCRIPT
###### Data Types
* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
* Exceptional Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.
###### Conditional Logic
* Novice Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.
* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
* Exceptional Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.
###### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* don't recreate objects when you can use the original e.g ideaToStore in setInLocalStorage
###### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
save one key to localstorage where the value is an array of ideas
use forEach to iterate over the contents of an array
###### Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* localstorage methods
* DOM Manipulation
* Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* rename IdeaFactory to Idea
* refactor setInLocalStorage, don't need to create a new object.

##### GIT & GITHUB
###### Git
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
###### Github
* Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN
###### Comp Recreation
* Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING
###### Collaboration
* Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### 2Do Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielafcarey/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2Do Box Pivot was an extension of the previous project, IdeaBox. We inherited an IdeaBox codebase and had to refactor it and pivot to a to-do list with similar features and a few additional features. This app stores to-do items in local storage for a user, who can change the importance on, mark as completed, or delete ideas. One of our first early challenges was refactoring the existing code. We found it difficult to find the boundary between refactoring too much and still maintaining the spirit of the original code. Similar to the last project, Sage and I did most of our work together, which provided for great learning and problem-solving together.

## D: Professional Skills

This mod, we learned about stress management, how to work with different personalities, how to master difficult things, and the value of learning through teaching. 

### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness - Stress Management

* [Managing Stress](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udbQS8rNQX0aM0dtxHerV30W7HGVGOcWfqOpDKVVcts/edit#slide=id.p3)

This session we discussed the different types of stress and different types of self-care to manage that stress. I found this to be an extremely valuable session to have at the beginning of the mod so that I could mentally prepare and set goals to manage my stress in the coming weeks. It helped to have the time to self-reflect and determine where my known weak points were in terms of managing stress so that I could be proactive about manging those areas throughout the mod. I challenged myself to reflect after every week of this mod as a small check-in to make sure I was staying on top of my wellness. 

#### Working Styles

* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

During this session, we discussed different working styles specifically related to introversion and extroversion. We identified where we each stand and were able to hear insights from all across the intro-/extro- spectrum. Hearing this was valuable, especially going into our first paired project. I was challenged to consider these differences not as hurdles, but as differences to embrace as each person brings a different strength and perspective to the table when working on a project together. 

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This gear up resonated with me so strongly. I was challenged to consider how I am managing my congitive resources in general (reducing conginitive drip where I can) and to use this to learn new skills better and faster. I love the idea of splitting large, daunting skills into smaller skills to master so that as I master each of these, I master the larger skill. This method is how I approach problem-solving so it was helpful to think about applying this to learning. I loved the practical takeaways to utilize my resources to learn from high-quality, high-quantity examples so that these skills become second-nature to me. This was extremely useful this mod and even going into the pentathalon week I put this into practice by practicing over and over, even if I felt I had already learned the skill I needed for the eval. 

#### Learning Through Teaching

This session taught by Mod 4 students was a valuable discussion about what we can gain from being mentors. We discussed the concept that we learn better when we teach the content to someone else. We also discussed tips for reaching out to mentors, being a good mentee, and being a good mentor when that time comes. I am excited to use these tips as I move into Mod 2 and can help Mod 1 students. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The Turing community is a valuable asset of Turing that I was not expecting going into my first mod. After week 1, I was blown away by how strong the community is and how supported I felt. I had multiple opportunities to contribute to the community within my own cohort through impromptu pairing sessions, sharing tips/tricks I learned on a project, attending networking events together, and through our weekend study sessions. I loved the support from Mod 2 and took advantage of the pairing sessions and Mythical Creatures review. These opportunities are one of the things I'm most excited for when I'm in Mod 2 - pairing with the Mod 1 students.  

Beyond this, I was an active member in the Armstrong Posse and loved the opportunity to connect with upper-mod students in my posse. I also connected with multiple Turing alumni to discuss a possible mentor relationship and get general advice on what life will be like after Turing.
