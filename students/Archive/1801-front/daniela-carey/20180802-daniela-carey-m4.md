## Biggest Achievement

My biggest achievement of the module was getting a job :)

## Biggest struggle
The biggest struggle this mod was balancing projects with the job search. I was so  motivated to get a job that I wanted to spend all my time doing that and less time doing projects. I had to constantly remind myself that in a way, the projects are helping me get a job and the reality is that they did help. Many of the topics we covered in Mod 4 came up in my interviews and I was thankful to have not completely neglected learning those concepts. 

## What sets me apart? 

The experience I got working with Coding Nomads set me apart in that I gained experience working with new technologies like AWS, Java for backend, mySQL Workbench, etc. Additionally, we gained valuable experience working with an external team and having to coordinate with the backend, even though we didn't know the language and weren't writing it ourselves.  

## Full stack experience

The full stack experience definitely gave me an appreciation and deeper understanding of the technologies I was using in previous mods. Knowing how a server and database work gives me more insight when I consume those APIs and can help me better diagnose errors. After Turing, I hope to use this knowledge to be a better teammate to backend engineers as we work together on a product. 

## Skillz

The most valuable skill I've learned here is developing a problem-solving process. In programming, you're solving problems constantly and solving problems of all different sizes. Having a process helps me solve problems efficiently and thoroughly, predict potential roadblocks, and ultimately be a better developer.
