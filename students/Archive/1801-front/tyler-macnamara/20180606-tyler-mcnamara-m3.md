## Areas of Emphasis

I came into this inning knowing that what we learning in Mod 3 was crucial for acquiring a developer position so I made it a focus to put as much time and effort into learning these new skills as possible while developing the foundations even further. 


I felt a little shaky with React coming out of Mod 2 so over the break I focused a lot on becoming more familiar with the framework and made it an area of emphasis for me throughout the Mod, which to be fair, wasn't hard as our projects all required the use of it.

## Individual Work & Projects

I worked extremely hard this inning both on my individual and group projects, however, my individual projects felt slightly more productive in terms of meeting my areas of emphasis for this inning. 

Swapi-Box was challenging and a great jump start into forcing me to work through a React project on my own. My personal project, Daytrip, was even more grueling and after 100+ hours of React, Redux, Router, API, and Firebase work, I felt I really solidified my skills in all of these areas including testing, which I actually enjoy now (never thought I'd say that).

The group projects were also productive and helped me learn these same coding abilities along with how to work in pairs and as a team, an extremely valuable skill required for this type of work.

### Headcount 2.0

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

It was enjoyable jumping right back into a React / API project like Headcount in Mod 3. The project went extremely smoothly as I felt more comfortable with React than I anticipated after studying the framework over break. Ryan and Alan were great partners which helped make the project a success. 

#### Partners

* Ryan Harrington
* Alan Charles

#### Scoring

We received mostly 3's, a couple 4's, and "magic" for an extension on the project.

### SWAPIbox

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPIbox was a great learning experience being the first time I worked with React on my own. I learned a lot about testing and React but more importantly how to manage the workflow of a more complicated project. I was pleased with the final project.

#### Scoring

I received mostly 3.5's and 4's on the project and Christie commented that I did a "Great Job".

### Movie Tracker

Movie Tracker, like all the projects this inning, was fun and a great learning experience. We were introduced to Redux the week we started the project which was difficult to implement at first without having a good understading of the library but once we began to feel more comfortable with it, really enjoyed using Redux for the first time. This project helped me pick up Redux quickly and develop a strong understanding for it. 

#### Partners

* Theresa Marquis
* Eric Jungbluth

#### Scoring

We received mostly 3.5's and 4's on the project.

### Personal Project

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/mcnamara14/daytrip)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The most enjoyable and also most difficult project so far for me at Turing was the personal project. I created an app that allowed users to search for events in their city and choose filters for restaurants and bar types. In doing so multiple plans were displayed showing suggested restaurants and bars walking distance to the event. 

This project was a lot more work than I anticipated coming into it but I was extremely pleased with the final result. I also loved working on a project where I choose the topic. I feel like I also learned the most during the process of developing Daytrip. The large scale of the app forced me to test extensively, use project management software often, and become much more familiar with the topics we learned this inning such as React, Redux, Router, and Firebase along with interacting with multiple API's.

#### Scoring

I received most 4's on the project along with a couple 3's.

## Gear Ups

[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)
This session was very eye opening for me. I rarely notice how often microaggressions occur and what impact they can make on someone's lives. Learning to recognize when these happen so you can help stop it from occuring is important and without classes such as these to teach you to understand what a microaggression is, knowing when a microaggression is happening would be extremely difficult.

[Code Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)
We watched a movie that discussed the large gender gap in the coding world. It was alarming to learn about how large the gender gap truly was but important to learn about so we can make changes. Changes to how we bring up our children so more females feel comfortable aspiring to become a developer and changes to the hiring process that encourages more females to apply for developer jobs and get hired as well.   

## Community Participation

This inning I made it a priority to help out classmates and students in other mods when I noticed someone struggling, particularly in Redux and Firebase, two subjects I felt confident in. I helped clean up the kitchen multiple times, attended demo night, and tried to participate in in activities going on with classmates. 

## Outcome: PASS

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3+
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
