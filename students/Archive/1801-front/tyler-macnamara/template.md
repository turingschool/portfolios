# Tyler McNamara - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I made a commitment to myself that I was going to work as hard as possible to succeed in this program which meant making sacrifices in other aspects of my life so that I could completely focus on programming. I didn't have any previous programming experience so wasn't sure how I would do at Turing but didn't want to fail because of a lack of effort. 

This module I was hoping to get a good grasp of the basics of programming and begin to change the way I think to one of a developer. I understand that working in a team and with partners will be the norm after landing a job in the field so learning how to use Github was a priority of mine as well. Learning how to correctly implement HTML, CSS, and JS in combination was another area of emphasis for me.
