## Areas of Emphasis

This inning I had a much different focus than I did in the first one. The first inning I wanted to get the fundamentals of JavaScript, GitHub and other related technologies down. This inning I wanted to dig deeper and develop a more in-depth understanding of these technologies as well as learn some new ones such as React which I have been excited to begin working with.

I feel like I have achieved this goal. I have become more comfortable with JavaScript, especially object-oriented programming this inning, as well as developed my GitHub knowledge and testing abilities. I understand that I still have a lot to learn in these areas but I feel like I have developed the abilities to jump into more advanced topics as school progresses. In terms of communication, although I don't love public speaking, I appreciated the addition of lightning talks for each mod. I felt much more comfortable giving my talk this time around than in the first and feel like this has helped me feel more comfortable speaking in front of people in general.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

I worked extremely hard this inning both on my individual and group projects, however, my group projects felt slightly more productive in terms of meeting my areas of emphasis for this inning. 

I wasn't expecting to dig as deep as we did into algorithmic thinking this inning and back-end type of learning but understand the importance in doing so. Although sorting suite and complete me were different types of projects than I have been exposed to at Turing so far I felt extremely accomplished by completing them and learning something different. 

The most challenging aspect of these individual projects was learning recursion and how to effectively implement it. Being my first time exposed to recursion and the call stack in general it was hard to understand initially but I was able to get a good grasp of these concepts in the end. 

I want to continue putting in the hours next mod like I have done so far at Turing but want to be careful not to over exert myself by taking breaks so I can think more effectively. I would also like to slow down a bit and get a really good grasp of the basics of each new topic before jumping into the projects.

### Study Habits

I noticed that I spent a lot more time this mod studying outside of school. We had a lot of challenging projects, especially Game Time, that required some long days and nights so worked much longer this inning to complete the work. I noticed that I disregarded my health more this inning than in the first, sacrificing exercise for school, something I want to change next inning. Besides that I would like to focus a little less on my projects being completely polished and study other topics we learn in the lessons more than I have in the past. 

### Sorting Suite
**Outcome:** PASS

[Sorting Suite](https://github.com/mcnamara14/TDD/tree/sorting-suite)

I enjoyed learning about recursion and understanding how the call stack works. Recursion is a super powerful tool and happy to have gotten a good feel for how to use it. 

It was difficult getting started with Sorting Suite because I had a limited knowledge of recursion and the call stack in general. I had to learn how these two things really worked before I was even able to dive into the project and get them completed. It was much different doing this project than the group projects as I had to work alone a lot as well as a group to complete all the sorting algorithms. I feel like I learn better when I have a partner to talk things through with but, although it took some reps, I feel like I really learned the concepts in the end. 

Digging deeper into algorithms and developing that way of thinking will help in every aspect over the next two mods as well as post graduation. When coming across problems in interviews and at my future job being able to understand how to break down a complex problem like we came across in Sorting Suite will be important.

### Complete Me
* **Process:** 3
* **Fundamental JavaScript & Style:** 3+
* **Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation:** 3+
* **Functional Expectations:** 3

[Complete Me](https://github.com/mcnamara14/complete-me)

Complete Me taught me how to break down a complicated algorithm into a solvable problem through white boarding and problem solving as a group. 

Working with a group was different than working on a paired project like Game Time in many aspects. Working as a group meant less reliance on myself or one other person to get everything done and more on figuring out a solution collectively by either being a leader or listener. This project pushed me to become more of a leader and teacher than in the usual paired projects which helped me understand the concepts on a deeper level than I may have been able to do by myself or with one other person. 

By completing this project I feel like I developed a much stronger understanding of how programming works at a basic level which is something I really wanted to accomplish this inning. This will inevitably help me out through the rest of my time at Turing, in interviews, and in the work force after school.

## B: Group Work & Projects

I really enjoyed the group projects this inning even though we picked a project that was more time consuming than we anticipated for Game Time. 

My partners were both great. In both situations my partners were able to help me understand topics I didn't grasp as well and in turn I helped them on areas they were weaker at. In the end I believe both projects turned out well and we learned a lot in the process. These projects definitely aligned with my goals for the inning. I learned a lot about React and now feel comfortable with the library as well as developed a much stronger understanding of OOP through my work on Game Time. 

As in the past I tried to work with my partners as much as needed to complete projects that I was proud of. I want to continue this trend by keeping my schedule open to accommodate my partners. When working apart I would like to continue to develop my GitHub and Waffle skills so that I feel as comfortable working apart as I do in person.

I enjoyed a lot of things about Game Time. Working with Jim was great, he taught me a lot about testing and GitHub and celebrated a ton of victories along the way. We picked a challenging project that seemed a bit over our heads at first but ended up being a great learning experience. 

It was challenging learning about canvas in tandem with OOP and testing but these were a couple areas of emphasis I wanted to focus on this inning resulting in a positive outcome at completion. Testing, GitHub, and OOP are all concepts that I will continue to use at Turing and beyond so happy to learned a lot about them all during Game Time.

I loved working on Weatherly. Not only did we jump back into working with the front end again and design which I enjoy but it gave me a chance to learn React, something I wanted to learn when entering this inning. Creating an application that resembled a real world application through utilization of our skills we've learned at Turing was very fulfilling.

I understand that the next inning will involve React much more than in the past so understanding the basics of the library through this project will undoubtedly help me in inning 3. I would also love to land a position where I use React after Turing so any education of it while attending Turing will be beneficial. React also inspired my Code Fair project's partner and I to turn that project into a React project so extremely grateful to have learned how to use it to build a complex personal project like we are working on. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Agile Practices
  * Feedback 2
  * Feedback 3
  * Storytelling 2
  * Networking

There was a lot I learned during the PD sessions this inning taking something out of each session. 

The Agile session taught me the difference between Agile and Waterfall, two concepts I have heard about but didn't have a good understanding of until the session. I was surprised to learn how many large companies take a waterfall approach to their project development although it seems to almost always cost a lot more in doing so and typically ends with a lower quality final product. 

The feedback session deepened my understanding and importance in giving quality feedback that is productive as well as how to take feedback in a productive way without being offended by criticism. 

Storytelling was a fun session. I enjoy storytelling but learned that I'm not always the best at telling a compelling story that draws people in while painting myself out as a hero at the same time. These sessions have helped me organize my thoughts more effectively before speaking so that I come off as a hireable person. 

Networking was one of my favorite sessions because it reiterated the fact that I need to continue to reach out to people in the field so that I have a better chance at finding my desired developer position upon graduation. There have been times that I have put studying above networking and this session reminded me that both are important. 

After attending the PD sessions I feel that much more prepared for interviews and my life as a developer than I did before attending them. Just learning code is important but these are a great reminder that there is more to succeeding in the fielding than being able to program. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Empathy & Privilege: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown
  * Group Think/Attention Economy/Tragedy of Commons: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md
  * Mindfullness

I learned through the Empathy & Privilege session that everyone has their own struggles that aren't outwardly apparent. This helped me connect with my classmates more than I have since being at Turing. Group think was especially intriguing. We learned that group think is way too common in businesses along with other aspects of life in general. The mindfullness session was also very interesting. I learned that we all tend to think way too much about things that aren't always important which tends to make us less happy and more anxious in general. I learned ways to overcome this through meditation, stretching, and my doing things that take our minds of things that make us stressed. 

I think it's very important have conversations like we do in Gear Up's because it not only connects us with the people that we will spend a lot of time with but helps us remember that coding isn't just about getting a job but about helping out our society in general. 

I feel much more comfortable opening up to others now than I have in the past and have the tools now to bring up topics with my classmates and future coworkers that I would have avoided in the past. 

## Community Participation

This inning I tried to be more involved in group learning and study session than I did in the past ny participating in Iron FE as much as possible, after school work sessions, as well as partnering with past students and people in the field. I kept my schedule very open for pairings with mod 1 students and helped them out as much as I was able to do. 

I really enjoyed getting to know the mod 1 students, peers outside of turing, as well my classmates more this inning. Pairing with mod 1 helped me solidify the topics I learned previously and pairing with higher Mods really helped me learn new concepts. 

## Final Assessment

I plan on working on my personal project Steph and I presented at Code Fair over the break by turning it from a static application to one using React. I also plan on studying all the topics that I wasn't as confident in this mod so that I enter the next inning feeling prepared to dig much deeper into the new concepts.

I hear that the next inning is challenging but also fun because we really start to develop the skills that we will use in the field after graduation, this is something I look forward to. I'm extremely excited to work on our personal projects, I have many ideas and feel that I will be very passionate about working on something that I choose to work on. 

To recharge I plan on getting back into a healthy routine of exercising, sleeping and eating healthy, things I put on the back burner this mod. I want to relax a little but also want to prepare for the next inning as much as possible. I want to spend time revisiting areas that I need work on as well as spend a lot of time networking and finding mentors that can help me during the rest of my time at Turing and after graduation.
