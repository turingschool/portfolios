## Mod 4 Overview
### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

In my opinion my biggest achievement of the mod was my capstone project, Happy Hour Hero. Jim and I put a lot of time into the project and in the end I feel like we created an app that we were both really proud of that met MVP. This project brought together everything that I have learned at Turing including the new material from back-end and felt accomplished to have been able to use most of that material to create a solid project.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Getting started with Express and PostgreSQL was a struggle partly because we were just coming off a long break but also because it was material that was very different than anything we have done at Turing previously. It was difficult moving away from the front-end but after fighting to understand these new topics and I eventually made a breakthrough and began to understand how the back-end works. I learned from this experience that Turing really has taught us how to learn programming more than anything else. At first I was worried that the back-end may be too abstract for me to understand but in the end I was able to learn it quickly and now feel very comfortable working with schemas, databases, endpoints, etc. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

What set me apart I feel is the same as my biggest achievement, my capstone. I feel like I've done a good job at Turing creating projects that are not only built well but are also designed well in addition. My capstone project followed this theme in my opinion. We put a lot of effort into Happy Hour Hero and I feel like it turned out looking and working great. 

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Mod 4 and learning the back-end made me realize that I could do more after Turing than I originally thought. While moving throught the previous mods I pictured myself doing kind of stale front-end coding for my entire career but learning the back-end made me realize I have more potential. I have always wanted the ability to build my own app's and potentially start my own company doing that, I feel like now I have the abilities to do both. I am also not scared to apply for positions that are more full-stack as I feel like I can pick up on back-end programing at the job more than I previously thought possiblt. 

This mod really connected the dots for me between everything I have learned at Turing. It made me realize that everything that earn at Turing is for a reason and mod 4 really brought all these skills together. It also made me realize how versatile JavaScript is, that it's more than just a front-end language and with JavaScript alone you have the ability to create complete applications. 

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Some of the most important skills that I will take with me into my job are asynchronous JavaScript, GitHub fundamentals, and React / Redux. I would love a position using React so learning how to use the framework at Turing may have been crucial. GitHub knowledge and working with other programmers is vital to integrating seamlessly into a company so glad that I have developed a strong understanding of the GitHub workflow at Turing as well.
