# Hugh Morrison - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module, I wanted to solidify my understanding of advanced active record, sql, and api design in rails. Im a big API guy and so I was looking forward to the opportunity to designing heaps of APIS and formatting sweet nested JSON. This mod, I wanted to bolster my understanding of the MVC pattern, I wanted to work on my whiteboarding skills and technical interview prep, I wanted to integrate myself further into the Turing Community, and I wanted to have fun while doing so. I beleive I acheived what I set out to accomplish.

## Self-Assessment

| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* I really gave it my all this module and I believe it paid off. I dont believe in 4s and so I think straight 3s conveys general hustle and grit and acheivement. The end of the module assessment was a doozy but I kept calm and collected and think I put forth a valiant effort.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* For APIcurious, I built a subpar github clone. I built an internal API in rails and hit that API in react. For this project, I wanted to solidify my understanding of the rails environment and how one goes about consuming outside data in rails. very cool experience. I also used webpacker and rails to incorporate React. 8/10 would do again.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I'm a big surfer and surf forecasting sites are notoriously inaccurate. I set out to build my own.
I set out to build a data visualization heavy app that would pull in surf forecast data from three seperate sources and consequently visualize that data in a meaningful way.

>* This was a super challenging project. I built an ultra sweet API in rails that did loads of data formatting and cool JSON manipulation and then served that data on a plethora of routes. I also used JWT to authenticate the login and endpoint hitting flow.

>* I built the API using Rails with a postreSQL DB. The front end was built using React/React Router/Redux/Thunk/Leaflet/Chartjs/


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Rails engine was a versioned API that dealt heavily with business intelligence. It relied upon complex active record and a multitude of complex relationships. Slim controllers/ Slim JSON/ 10/10.
>* I loved this project. It was our first introduction to API design in rails and it was ultra sweet.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* The field sure was brown on this LE PIVOT but we perservered and built an incredible app. Our team was strong and communicated well and as such we were able to incorporate some very coool functionality.
>* Legacy code is whack. That being said, this was an almost invaluable learning experience. 9/10.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [MICROAGGRESSIONS](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
>* this was a fantastic gear up. the newly revamped lesson plan was also invaluable. For reference, I had the honor of attending the first iteration as well. This second iteration introduced the content in a fantastic way that allowed for ultimate absorption and insight.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* I had the opportunity to co lead Kay posse. I'm ashamed to say that we did not make the best use of our time. We failed to set a clear directive and goal and I take responsibility for that. Next mod is another opportunity.

#### **Playing a Part**
>* This module, I made myself available for pairings with both front end and back end students, I showed up at denver tech meetups, learned many invaluable lessons in gearups and posse led spikes, I tried to attend weekly meditation sessions in Clarke Hall. As always, I had planned on doing more but I was simply stretched for time.
