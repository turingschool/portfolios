# Hugh Morrison - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I had done a solid amount of ruby prework yet didnt feel as though the information I absored was contextualized. Meaning, I knew close to nothing about OOP and the design of Ruby and Ruby code. So, essentially, I knew nothing. My primary goal this module was to contextualize the information I knew, to bolster my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and to integrate myself even more into the Turing Community. 

I struggled tremendously (and often) this module. Data manipulation, algorithmic thinking, implementing data structures, and so on were always the weakest facets of my game. And as such, doing nothing BUT these things for the past 6 weeks has been nothing short of brutal and nothing short of enlightening. 

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I liked complete me. Grappling with the Trie data structure was quite fulfilling. But, on the whole, this mod was akin to eating my vegetables as a toddler. It's no fun at all, it's tolerable, but it's good for me in the long run.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
How to "embrace the suck" even further. That's primarily it. I learned how to approach problems with tenacity and how not to get overwhelmed by seemingly insurmountable odds. 

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
I only had the one, Black Thursday, and it was absolutely delightful. I had a wonderful partner who approached complex problem solving in novel and interesting ways. We had a very communicative and open vibe and collaborated very well together. 

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I really enjoyed the M4 led gear up. I attended the one on design and the design process, I can't remember the name of the session. It was led be people who thoroughly enjoyed the topic and that made it engaging, fulfilling, and quite informative. I can't say I had a least favorite. They were all enlightening and important. 

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
This mod I attended a hackathon, showed up for some Denver tech meetups, learned a lot in many invaluable gearups and posse led spike sessions, made heaps of friends, and had a wonderful time. I paired with FE mod-1 students a few times and attended weekly meditation sessions in Clarke Hall. I planned on doing more, as someone who has been in this basement for far too long, but I was simply drowning in the coursework. 


#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next mod, I plan on pairing with M1 BE & FE often. I also plan on becoming a co-lead of my posse. Beyond those specific things, I plan on being around more, on attending more Turing sponsored events, on getting to know more of the people here, and on venturing beyong the confines of our classroom.
