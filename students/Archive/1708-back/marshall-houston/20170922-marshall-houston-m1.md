## Areas of Emphasis

- What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  When I started, I set a goal to focus on depth of learning with both concepts and people in the community. In the fifth week, I finally felt like the depth of my conceptual knowledge matched my expectations that I set out in the beginning. By then, I had developed basic understanding of how to do 'a thing', so then I could make connections with other concepts and develop a lens for pattern matching. As for people in the community, I've felt successful since the beginning in making connections with people across programs and mods; I draw energy from learning about people's motivations and hopes, and I knew that I had to put myself out there to feel a strong connection with the Turing community.


- What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I'm always trying to figure out why something works, and I'm not satisfied with only knowing that something works on a surface level; the first two weeks were extremely challenging because I hadn't figured out my own learning process for programming. I wanted to know more about a topic, but since my understanding of the basic concepts weren't strong, I couldn't make the deeper connections. I was angry at myself because I felt like I wasn't learning fast enough, and I wasn't learning deep enough. Once I gave myself some space to realize that my learning curve for programming wouldn't necessarily follow other learning curves, I found the time to define my process for learning a new concept. First, I need to put in time on rote memorization about a method or a concept to understand the components. Then, I need to look at multiple examples of this concept in action and push myself to make more generalized connections about how and why something works; I have to take notes during this section to transfer the knowledge and give myself the peace of mind that I can review it in the future. Finally, I need to verbalize these understandings to leverage my strength as a verbal processor. This step can be done alone, but I've found it to be the most successful if I process with a mentor or somebody else who has a deeper understanding of this concept because I can ask them to identify gaps/blind spots in my understanding.

## Projects

- What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project has been Black Thursday because I have had a chance to connect multiple concepts in a challenging setting. This project has forced me to plan, poke and prod the ideas from the planning, and then adjust based on feedback from my partner. I have absolutely loved that exchange with another developer on an abstract and, at times, fussy project. This project has brought out the best in me because I'm excited to tackle the nuanced relationships between objects that aren't apparent on the surface.

  My least favorite project was A Perilous Journey because I had set my own expectations too high relative to my current level of understanding, and I didn't ask for help because I wasn't sure what I was doing. Now, I realize that feeling is a PERFECT opportunity to ask for help. If I hadn't tackled it alone, I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more; I did end up getting a lot out of the project because I was able to understand the idea of saving information in a variable, iterating through a collection, and encapsulating responsibility in classes.

- What did you learn from your independent projects?

  The number one thing I've learned is that I can't tackle projects alone. I need to spend time wrapping my head around a project, and then I need to talk with someone to use my verbal processing strengths. When I've kept my thoughts to myself in this planning stage, I've missed key connections and relationships of the objects in the project. After I've planned, I need to visually map out the connections; I didn't develop a clear visual model on my independent projects because I saw other people mapping their thinking on the computer, and I figured that way was the "right" way to do projects. I now realize that's a ridiculous way of thinking because it doesn't use my personal way of learning.

  More programming specific concepts I've learned are the power of writing strong tests, encapsulating responsibility to narrowly define an object's behavior, and the joys of pry.

- What did you learn from your paired projects?

  The biggest takeaway I've learned from the paired projects is to take the DTR seriously because it gives you a chance to start communicating directly and in a way that respects the humanity of the other person. Once this foundation is set out, it's been much easier to separate the stress of a project from the frustrations that may come with working with someone else. It's given me a chance to change my perspective from "why doesn't my partner listen to my ideas" to "how does my partner prefer to discuss ideas." I'm now thinking about how my partner processes information, which then gives me an opportunity to present my ideas in a format that will be heard.

  I've also learned that I like to generate many ideas and discuss the pros and cons of these ideas before deciding on a specific path. This process helps to gain a deeper understanding of the project because I can explain the rationale for why we went a certain way AND why we didn't go another way.

## Community

- What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  I enjoyed the gear up on introversion and extroversion because it gave me a chance to think about how I draw energy and how my own energy can impact others. It gave me the space to consider other perspectives in a non-stressful setting, and I've been able to keep this in mind when the stress of a paired project hits in full force. This gear up also gave me the confidence to advocate for my own needs when I'm not feeling my best. If I need space to verbally process, I now speak up and make it happen.

  I'm struggling to choose a least favorite gear up; these sessions feel very similar to the type of sessions that I loved teaching to my middle school students. Gear ups have also been a place where I've felt successful in each session, and that was a nice respite from the constant barrage of feeling unsuccessful with more programming specific topics during weeks 1-3.

- How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I have served as the SAB representative for my cohort, and in that role, I've implemented appreciations and regrets in our cohort retros. This is a time to explicitly appreciate other people and publicly "regret" anything that you aren't proud of (for example, I regretted sending a sarcastic response on slack the night before a project was due). I believe this has been one of the keys to the strength of our cohort culture.

  In week 1, I attended demo night and encouraged my classmates to attend as well. We ended up having 5 people from Mod 1 at the Demo Night final (plus two sigificant others).

  At the end of a gear up, I spoke up about respecting guests by putting away phones and computers during the guest panel; we had Turing alumni come speak about growth mindset, and it frustrated me that people were clearly not paying attention.

  I've also connected with multiple people across mods and started to get to know them on a personal level. The strength of the community was one of the main reasons that I wanted to attend Turing, and after being a part of the community for a mod, I believe that strength comes from the personal connections. These personal connections lead people to willingly lend a helping hand on technical and non-technical topics, offer to support students in other mods, and spend time to insure the overall success of the community.

- What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to lead a spike for mod 1 students on some helpful tips and tricks for students who are coming in without a technical background. I'd also like to introduce myself to mod 1 students in the first week of the mod and know the names of at least 10 mod 1 students by the end of week 2.

  During intermission week, I'm volunteering at a former Turing student's presentation for Denver Startup week and volunteering at the Rocky Mountain Ruby Conf, so I'd like to find at least one opportunity to give my time to support the broader community.

  Finally, I want to help get the Pahlka posse back up and running in a formal capacity; there are a couple other students in my module who have applied to get formal group status at Turing, and I'd love to help them out!
