# Marshall Houston - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a better understanding of testing, business analytics, and all aspects of APIs (creating them, consuming them, integrating multiple ones into a single application). I also wanted to focus on reading documentation and trying something new in the face of uncertainty on how to implement a feature. I also wanted to focus on improving my workflow as a developer so that I'm prepared to add value to an engineering team once I leave Turing (git workflow, code review, writing user stories, speaking technically).

| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

This mod was an interesting one from a personal self-confidence standpoint. I've learned an incredible amount, and I've been able to help others (both in my mod and in other mods) with problems they've encountered, but confidence in myself is at the lowest point it's been at Turing. I'm not sure if that's because of unrealistic expectations I have about the type of product I can build in a timeframe, or if it's just the natural process of battling imposter syndrome, but I'm working towards getting better. I know that I'm going to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I just have to keep pushing to try new topics, implement new features, and take on things that I don't think I can do.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* Consume an external API (Github), implement OAauth for login, use POROs to create service objects to focus on Single Responsibility Principle, use CSS/HTML (flexbox especially) to replicate another site's design.

I really enjoyed this project because it helped me gain a better understanding of single responsibility in MVC, passing information to and from service objects, creating and using objects in the views, flexbox, and the handshake / token authentication system.

I also pushed myself to enter this project into the Code Fair because I had set a goal to improve my technical speaking ability and to get over the fear of showing "unfinished" code (isn't all code unfinished on some level... there will always be more refactoring around the corner).

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* Match-Up, an application that helps high school teachers and students find the right fit at a public college or university in Colorado. This project implemented OAuth using Google, used AJAX calls to render charts based on user data, and focused on creating a software solution for a real client (high school teacher in Denver Public Schools).

It has been a mix of joy and frustration working on an independent project that addresses a real-life problem. I've learned about scope creep and ways to improve my workflow to focus on a small piece of new functionality (wireframes, clear user stories, feedback from the client). I've been daunted by the prospect of using jQuery and JavaScript with 3rd party libraries for the first time, but I've been able to continue pushing through the uncertainty to add these pieces of functionality. I better understanding styling and how to read documentation because I used a new CSS framework (basscss).

I also realize that navigating the tension between adding functionality that falls within my comfort zone and learning something new that makes me a better developer long-term can be a challenge, and I'm glad that there are more experienced folks who have pushed me to attempt something new and challenging.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Create an API with 40+ endpoints that serve custom JSON and provide deep business analytics.

I loved focusing on how to break down complex business intelligence queries, diagramming relationships, using rails dbconsole to display table data, and allowing tests to validate whether the query actually returned what we expected.

I also enjoyed learning about JSON and getting my first insights into APIs; I've heard about APIs for awhile, so I had a lot of fun seeing specific data rendered on the page after hitting a specific endpoint.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Brownfield project that took a single e-commerce site and built it into a  multi-tenancy application, created multi-level authorization with a variety of features at each level, and updated a production database without losing data.

I feel like this project made me a significantly better developer because it was a major increase in terms of planning, code review / collaboration, and workflow (continuous integration testing, development/staging/production environments, creating rake tasks to update a production database without compromising the data).

This project also changed the way that I look at creating software because I now am asking questions about flexibility, modularity, and performance.

## C. **Gear Ups**

[Attention Economy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md)
This session focused on how software is used to get and keep our attention, and it also focused on what we as developers should consider when developing software. After this session, I'm now more mindful about how much time I spend using Instagram/Twitter/Facebook. It's now easier for me to stop myself from mindlessly scrolling, but it's still a challenge to break out of the cycle. In terms of my own development, I'd like to build software that helps people reach some concrete goal, so I need to make sure that I look for companies who are accomplishing this with their products.

[Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This session focused on the ways that biases manifest themselves in conversations, both public and private, and can marginalize people. I've tried to be more mindful about how my language can cause pain and discomfort for others. I've also become more aware of the role that I can play as an ally to stop or call out microaggressions that affect others.

Jobs From Blogs

This gear up focused on how tutorials and technical articles can improve the overall software community and help increase your own standing in the community through writing. I really liked the focus on the ways that writing with a specific audience in mind can make your writing more purposeful. I also appreciated that this gear up focused on the learning process that each of us goes through because it helped alleviate some of the fears I have about writing technically.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

I mentored a mod1 student by pairing each week to work on assessments and answer questions, and I also met and answered questions with two additional mod1 students.

I presented a project in the Code Fair and encouraged some of my classmates to present, and I also signed up for Demo Night.

#### **Posse**

My posse focused mostly on supporting each other with the projects and questions we had. I helped both a mod1 and mod2 student answer some questions they had about assignments.

At other times, we talked about how we were managing the stress and challenges at Turing and supported each other to find positive coping mechanisms.

#### **Playing a Part**

I signed up for a Lightning Talk next inning and slacked the 1710 and 1708 cohorts encouraging them to sign up for lightning talks; we now have 5 folks in the BE program signed up to give talks next inning, which is a 500% increase compared to BE folks in this inning.
