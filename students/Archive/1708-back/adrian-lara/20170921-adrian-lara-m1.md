## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  My goal in this module was pretty straightforward - I wanted to learn as much as I could from the instructors, curriculum, and other students.  My thought is that this would lead me to be successful with the actual work assigned, and this would put me in a great position to pass Mod 1. With my goal phrased in that way, I think that there were definitely moments where I could have done more.  But regardless, I did learn a great deal and, hopefully, put myself in a position to move on to the next module.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  In this module, there were many moments where I struggled with managing the heavy workload.  Coming in, even though I held a belief that I could handle a certain level or weight in terms of workload, I was definitely concerned about the amount of work/energy that would be expected of me from Mod 1. I wasn't sure how I'd fair, but during the program I was willing to continually face this struggle.  I worked to prioritize/organize my responsibilities amid a continuous stream of work and new concepts.  From this, I learned that my workload ceiling is higher than I thought (though I think I'm pretty close to it in this Mod).

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project I worked on in this module was Date Night.  I loved struggling with and learning about the ideas of recursion.  I enjoyed implementing this idea in my code, and it felt like my brain was working in different ways than it had previously.  My least favorite project was Battleship, but it had nothing to do with the project itself.  Actually, I enjoyed working on Battleship, but I didn't leave myself with a reasonable amount of time to work on it.  By giving myself just over 3 days to work on it, it was a continually tough battle against time (and Battleship).

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  Independent projects taught me to be self-reliant in the realm of coding.  I am naturally inclined to figure things out myself, and I think the difficulty of these projects forced me to practice this with code.  From that, I think it made me a more capable developer, and it instilled a faith in myself that I am able to learn concepts in this field.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  The paired projects taught me a lot. These projects helped me improve my communication skills, forced me to learn from other's ideas/perspectives, and forced me to use new tools to help improve group workflow.  Each of these learning experiences were interwoven, and as I improved in one area, the other areas became easier.  As I learned about ways/tools to make the group workflow more efficient, group moral improved, because it led to everyone feeling more engaged in the project.  This led to me being able to communicate more easily with my partners, and even allowed me to better understand their perspectives or approaches to problems.  Overall, I'm happy about my progress and growth in terms of working with others, but I want to keep improving in this area.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite Gear Up was about Getting Better at Difficult Things.  This was my favorite, because it was the most interesting to me.  I am naturally inclined to understand the "why"'s behind events or occurrences, and "learning difficult things" is an event that we experience often at Turing.  So by naturally being aware of these concepts/ideas myself, I enjoyed hearing and reading other perspectives/insights regarding them. My least favorite was the Mod 4 hosted one.  The Gear Up content was awesome but cognitively engaging.  And given the timing within the module, my cognitive resources were limited, so I felt that I wish I had more energy to give to the conversations/ideas being shared in that Gear Up.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I contributed to the Turing community by putting in honest effort while participating in sessions, discussions, or events.  While interacting with others, I try to be my honest self while being both respectful and friendly.  I hope that this honest and good-willed approach helps others feel more accessible and connected with myself and the community as a whole.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to involve myself in more of the optional events.  In the next module, it would be awesome to participate in the code fair, and I'd like to attend more Turing-sponsored events.  Lastly, I'd love to contribute by helping the incoming class be successful in their own learning endeavor at Turing.
