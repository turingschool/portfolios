# Adrian Lara - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This mod, along with my usual goal of learning as much as I could, I had a goal to take steps toward becoming more employable.  To me, this meant practicing different skills.  Specifically, I wanted to improve my ability to communicate, plan, and work/pair with others.  Additionally, I wanted to also explore ideas/concepts on my own, which would also give me more practice in self learning/research like reading through technical docs and articles.  Mainly through group and individual projects, especially the Pivot and the personal project, I think I accomplished my goals.

>* For each of the categories, I've given myself 3's because I know there's always room for improvement.  Despite that, I am happy with the work I've done in this mod.  Through this work, I've given myself humble confidence with my pursuit of a career in software development.  To elaborate, I feel confident that this is work that I enjoy and that I am capable of working in this field, but with all the learning, I'm humbled by continually more evident reality that there will always be so much more to learn.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* Hit Github's API and mimic pages and functionality
>* I focused on cementing the ideas and tools in the project, and though I gave honest effort, I felt I didn't have much to show for it for this project.  

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* For this project, I wanted to explore an idea/concept that previously caught my curiosity-- machine learning.  To do this, I implemented a machine learning algorithm (Gaussian Bayes Distribution) from scratch and used it to learn user song preferences by communicating with the Spotify API.  Specifically, a user can like and dislike songs, and the algorithm will then try to predict whether that user will like other songs.
>* It was an awesome and challenging experience to take this challenging topic and wrap it in various concepts/ideas that I've learned during my time at Turing.  I enjoyed building and managing all the moving pieces of any web app along with the Spotify API and the machine learning algorithm.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Build an API based on consumer data
>* This was a great mini project where I had a chance to work with a developer I didn't have much interaction with previously.  It was very useful to have to learn both the material and how to best communicate/work with my partner.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Build on and expand on a web app built for a single online store.
>* This was another awesome and challenging experience.  I feel very fortunate to have had the group members that I had.  Everyone was very open, communicative, and humble. We planned extensively; we had numerous detailed discussions around how features would be implemented, when they would make most sense to implement, and how the work could be delegated to lead to their efficient completion.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
The sessions were very valuable in exposing important issues, having open conversations about them, and identifying strategies to address them going forward.  For example, after the MicroAggressions session, I've been able to more easily identify and address some of my own micro aggressions.  It's something that I hope to be mindful of going forward in the field and in my persona life.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* Throughout this mod, I've made myself openly available to lower mods for help on their work/projects as well as listening and exchanging ideas and experiences.  In doing so, I've tried to foster communication, collaboration, and support.

#### **Posse**
  >* Most of the time, our posse time was a time to relax and get to know others in different mods/programs
  >* My favorite experience with posses this mod was the Q&A we had with a mentor of ours
  >* It's great to be able to try to explain the things I'm learning to those not in my class, specially in mods below me.

#### **Playing a Part**

> Along with the community contributions mentioned above, I participated in SAB, giving time, cognitive resources, and energy to helping improve the Turing community.
