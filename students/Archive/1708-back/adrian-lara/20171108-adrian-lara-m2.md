# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  For this mod, I set my goal to be the same as last mod.  That is, I set out to learn as much as I could.  It was helpful and productive to focus on that goal, so that the "what if" thoughts didn't take precedence in my mind.  I was mostly successful with this goal, though it was harder in the beginning when things weren't "clicking" as well as they did in Mod 1.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled most with being comfortable having a lot of the environment set up for me. In Mod 1, I was accustomed to setting up file/folder structures, and it felt more straightforward.  If I didn't have any 'require' statements at the top of an .rb file, I wouldn't be able to have access to any classes or modules that every Ruby class doesn't automatically inherit.  To transition to an environment where these type of little things are set up for you is definitely convenient, but it also made me feel kind of uncomfortable.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was my personal project.  In all of my projects at Turing, it felt good to apply learned/practiced tools to get through predefined specs or iterations.  For the personal project, it was even better to use the tools to create a web app and craft my own web app with its own user stories/functionality.

  I don't feel very strongly about this, but my least favorite project was probably BikeShare.  It was tough to juggle all of the new concepts while also adjusting to and learning from people's workstyle.  That being said, and as evidence that I don't feel very strongly about this, I thought it was great learning experience.  I appreciated struggling through technical learning while also learning to work with individuals having different styles and preferences.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  My independent projects gave me a chance to learn/practice the concepts in my own way/pace.  Though I don't particularly love going through tutorials, it was useful to be able to learn with this tool and to apply this knowledge to the projects.  Also, specifically for my personal project, it was really helpful to learn different ways I need to organize myself in a situation where I have a lot of freedom.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  The pair projects taught me to work with others with different styles.  As tough/stressful as this can be sometimes, I really do value these experiences and having the chance to overcome issues via meaningful conversations.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite Gear Up was the Tragedy of the Commons.  It was intuitive to see that diversity went down when people had a certain level of preference for having similar neighbors, but what really stuck out to me was the level of preference towards having different neighbors needed to break an established lack of diversity.  
  My least favorite Gear Up was Empathy and Privilege. I don't feel very strongly this way, but one aspect of the Gear Up that could've improved was the clarity in some of the checklist prompts.  I recall feeling unsure what some them meant, but regardless, I did think it was an overall important and useful gear up.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I contributed to the Turing community by providing any help I could to students currently in Mod 1.  Whether that was technical pairings or just chatting with them regarding personal issues, I was happy to help and perpetuate the strong sense of community at Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I'd like to continue providing any help that I can to others.  I'd also like to contribute more to organizations within Turing.  I'm also committing to putting something in the Code Fair next inning.
