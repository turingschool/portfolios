# Liam Barstad - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module, I endeavored to make myself job ready and able to effectively work with a team and ship a product. As a bonus, I hoped to get better with python and be able to use it effectively.

>* I feel very job ready at this point. When working in a group, I can stay on task and build out features in an agile manner, and I feel like I could be a valueable asset to a company. I also learned enough python to be comfortable creating a django application, writing python scripts, and diving into flask.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/liambarstad/data_fiend_v1)**
>* A multithreaded application with five subapplications communicating through RabbitMQ written primarily in python. Grabs current and historical data from Interactive Brokers and Coinbase and runs it through market analysis.
>* I learned so much from this project about multithreading, python, and role delegation among applications. Even though none of it works, I now know where to start when developing a multi-tiered application of this nature, and it's a place that I would never have anticipated had I not been sporadic in my creative process. I got experience with developing a Rack application, and now it is clear to me how to write middleware, what a web application really does, and when to write a web application as opposed to a library or module. I submitted my first pull request on a repository that was written by someone else, QtPyLib. Pouring through thousands of lines of python code gave me a better sense of python syntax, style, and features. I now feel comfortable writing python, using tests, and implementing libraries.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/liambarstad/rales-engine)**
>* An API that accesses market data and business intelligence in large datasets using ActiveRecord
>* I feel like this project proved to me that I could write ActiveRecord and cemented the knowledge and muscle memory in place. Queries that would have taken dayys to write now take a matter of minutes, and actually work. I am very proud of this project, everything down to the README is operational and ready to be shown.

> **[The Pivot](https://github.com/liambarstad/the_pivot_base)**
>* A multitenanted website that extends an already existing shop to include new functionality
>* Through this project, I got to experience what a good group dynamic looks like and came to conclusions on how to replicate it in the future. Through developing the stripe functionality, I got to experience writing code, then having to re-traverse the same code over and over again. Thus I feel much more comfortable writing reusable code and having experience doing so.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\ I learned a lot about lisencing and the ethics of open source in this Gear Up. It was really cool to see this philosophical topic displayed through different "lenses", and the resulting discussion was very rewarding.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* During this mod, I gave a lightning talk on the principle of least power, I contributed to a (very) large python application on GitHub, and I paired with some awesome Mod2 and Mod1 students.

#### **Posse**
  >* I talked with members of my posse about high-level math and coding topics, which gave me new topics to think about in the future.
    >* I really enjoyed the discussions and code analysis in my posse, as well as the group dynamic and the willingness for collaboration.
      >* The posse has given me experience with presenting and bouncing ideas off of colleagues.
