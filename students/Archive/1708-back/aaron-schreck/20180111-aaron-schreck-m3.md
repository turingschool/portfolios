## Areas of Emphasis

> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>
This module I wanted to cement and my knowledge of Ruby and Rails to the point of employability. Specifically, I wanted to correct some of the bad software habits I had acquired in previous mods and write clean, well-tested code. My group projects from previous modules were not necessarily bad, but I noticed clear ways in which I could have been a better teammate that I wanted to correct in module 3.  
## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |

| D | **Professional Development** | 2.5 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2.5 |

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
    Overall, my experience of this module was exciting and encouraging. During mods 1 and 2, I had had some doubts over whether I wanted to pursue this as a career. During Le Pivot and the personal project, I really felt my skills come together and felt confident as a developer.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
  Got a lot of experience with APIs that helped me to build and query in-house APIs for both the pivot and personal project.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description> Politi-tracker allows you to follow politicians in a dynamic news feed.
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project was a lot of fun, and I really felt my skills and my own experience of being a developer come together. In the past I've struggled at times to gather motivation to perfect and finesse all the details of a project, and I think for this project I stayed disciplined.   
## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This project stretched my knowledge of SQL and database queries. It was a good teamwork/pairing experience.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This felt like an extremely high value two weeks at Turing. It helped me to realize that I had developed some bad/sloppy coding habits and I spend the rest of the module trying to correct them. I really enjoyed the freedom to create

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>
The gear-up on microaggressions has prompted conversations with cohort mates and helped me to examine my own language and conduct for traces of these behaviors. The information economy gear up helped me to start thinking about the moral dimension of my career as a software developer. My Mod4-led group was a touchstone for further reflection upon the moral dimension of technology with respect to Apple's decision to deny the FBI.
