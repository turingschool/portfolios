Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
    
    This mod, I set out to learn the fundamentals of Rails programming, to further prioritize TDD, cement my git workflow, to further develop my pairing skills, and to become more proficient at reading documentation. While I don't necessarily feel like I have achieved all of these goals in an absolute sense, I feel as though I have made significant strides on all of these fronts. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

    I think I struggled a significant bit with the different learning style that Rails demands over plain Ruby. I felt a lot more comfortable in the Mod1 environment when you could more or less logic your way through whatever you were doing plus a few google searches, and I at times struggled with having to simply memorize rails conventions the logic of which was often unclear. I think I made some good progress learning how to adapt my natural learning style to this kind of a framework. This involved reading a lot of documentation and trying to acquire a deeper knowledge of rails conventions. 

Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  
  Most favorite: Little Shop â€” I really felt my skills come together during this project and it felt like a really valuable real world application. 

  Least favorite: Bike Share. I felt the most shakey in my skills during this project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  These were really valuable because it forced me to work on skills like CSS that other members of my group project had been working on. It was also very cool to be totally resonsible for every line of code in the project. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  
  During remote day I had a really good experience working remotely via screenshare with my partners. I think I'm not naturally very good at partnering with all kinds of other people and so I got more experience working with different personalities. 

Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  
  Most favorite: network and outreach. I feel pretty uncomfortable with this whole aspect of Turing partly because I've only ever had one real adult job and this was full of super helpful information and helped make me feel more confident in this area. 

  Least favorite: Feedback III. Not bad, but it didn't really feel like I learned anything new. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I tried to be friendly and helpful to my classmates.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to be more successful at being friendly and helpful to my classmates.
