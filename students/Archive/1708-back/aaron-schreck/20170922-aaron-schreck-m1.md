# Aaron Schreck - M1 Portfolio


## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
This mod, I endeavored to learn the basics of Ruby programming, including
modules, enumerables, TDD, and git workflow. I have become proficient in all these
areas. Additionally, I set out to learn effective paired project skills(both
technical and soft) and I have become proficient in these as well

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I came into Turing pretty experienced with academic rigor, but I found a lot of
the collaborative and social demands of the Turing were a bit difficult to adjust
to at first. Over the course of the mod I have made more friends and become more
comfortable relying on others for projects and other work.  

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed Date Night because it introduced me to the concept of recursion,
and Black Thursday because it had exciting real world application.  

What did you learn from your independent projects? I paid attention to the way
that I work in an individual environment and learned ways to creat a workflow
that synergized with my personality. I also learned a lot of specific content
like how to use runner files and recursion.

What did you learn from your paired projects? I focused a lot on how to balance
working collaboratively(live pairing, etc) with individual work, and discovered
I need a strong balance of both to be successful.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed the Gear Up on the gender gap in tech, the one on growth mindset,
and the one on personal branding/social media. I found the gear-ups on personal
storytelling to be pretty ineffective. As someone who doesn't feel comfortable with
personal sharing, the extremely contrived nature of the sharing sessions was really
hard to get past (i.e. having a very short period of time to share with someone
that I already know felt more awkward than just meeting a stranger.) It was also difficult
for me as an introvert to have to think about an developer identity speech and then
share it rapid-fire a few minutes laterâ€”I think I would have done better with more time to
internalize what I wanted to say (maybe two separate session?)

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I posted regularly on slack,
helped my classmates with their projects, and tried in general to be a good friend.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to do the same next mod, but try to help others more often.
