# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
 In this module, I set out to learn the basics of Ruby and TDD and be able to
 apply those things I learned to group and individual projects. I also set out
 to get out of my fixed mindset that I was in during my first time in Module one.
 The last one is still a work in progress

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled most in this module when it came to the project Battleship. It was an
  extremely difficult project that I did not have a proper plan for, and it shot
  my confidence moving on but I did my very best to bounce back from it and do well
  through the rest of the module. Pairing was much better but I needed to do it more.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project in this module was Night Writer. It was a project that
  very challenging but I really felt like I contributed a great amount to this
  project and I also felt like I got the most out of it in terms of pairing, breaking
  down logic and methods to use in the future. My least favorite project was Battleship.
  It was a project that I did not plan for and shot my confidence. I felt like I did
  bounce back from it an will end the module on a high note.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
 I learned that pairing with people when I'm stuck on certain parts went a long way.
 It helped me so much when I paired with people on my projects which set me up to be
 able to ultimately be more efficient by myself and be able to work through things.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned that communication is key when working on a project. My partners and
I had great chemistry throughout the project which was good, we worked on most
of the project together which was great as we bounced ideas off of each other
which led to a better project in which all ideas were equally represented.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite gear up was the Growth Mindset session, as it really spoke to me
about what kind of person I have been and what I need to work on to be able to
produced better code and ultimately succeed in my new career path.
My least favorite was the one in which we talked about cognitive resources,
it seemed a little redundant I did not feel like it was very helpful
for me personally

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
 I feel like I contributed to Turing by helping the 1708 cohort with advice
 during the first few weeks, homework, mythical creatures and other exercises
 that will help them in the long run. I tried to continue continue keeping the
 kitchen clean as it is supposed to be module one's job.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to reach out to lower mods and pair with them regularly, hopefully
set them up for success. I would also like to present a project in the Code Fair.
