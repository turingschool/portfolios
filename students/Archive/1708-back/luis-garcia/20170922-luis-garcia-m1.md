## Areas of Emphasis
What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Before I came to Turing I read the rubric and immediately I knew what my goals where; to learn the basic fundamentals of ruby, object oriented programming and overall build my coding skills to higher levels. I also set out to make sure I asked plenty of questions and inquire about effective learning tools. Along the way I faced many obstacles that became new challenges. For the most as of now I feel as though I have found success, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. I know as my time here at Turing goes on I will continue to strengthen the areas I lack in such as not over thinking things. Overall, my aspirations have and still continue to become a reality.
The one specific thing that I found most struggling was the teaching style and pattern of learning. I’m not at all comfortable and nor am I fond of the way the material is taught, but I guess that’s what I signed up for. I continue to trust in the “system” everyday as I have been since day one. Although I prefer other ways of educating, as I look back in retrospect I can say I have learn a lot. 


## Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
What did you learn from your independent projects?
What did you learn from your paired projects?

I enjoyed working on every project except Black Thursday! The rumors we all heard were true, its definitely a very challenging project. In this project we have to incorporate everything we've learned and combine it with newer concepts which became new challenges as we built along. 
One the first thing that I learned was how to give up... but not really. I tended to be the "self" achiever and start what I finished all by myself kind of guy. But Turing humbled me very quickly and I learned after many hard times to simply start asking questions and its okay not to know. So although it was a independent project I learned to use other resources to advance. 
Throughout the paired projects I learn how to work together and incorporate/blend my work ethic and working styles with those of my partners. I learned to change my pace and delegate responsibilities effectively. I never encountered any problems while working in a paired assignment and I plan on keeping it that way(fingers crossed). I actually enjoyed my time in paired assignments and look forward to the new paired assignments with new people.


## Community
What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
What would you like to do to contribute next module?

My favorite gear up has to be the Introversion vs. Extroversion. It was quite fun seeing what everyone's result was, even though some could argue one's chosen results. 
Although one can argue that there isn't much to contribute as a first mod student, I like to think I contributed by allowing myself to become approachable and allow anyone to discuss any kind of issues, I also like to keep the mood up by keeping a positive attitude throughout the day and cheering my fellow students. Along the way I spoke with many individuals whom are not attending Turing, but have strong interests. In the near future I intend to create “cadences” that involve the invitation of people from different cultures and countries and provide them exposure to programming.
