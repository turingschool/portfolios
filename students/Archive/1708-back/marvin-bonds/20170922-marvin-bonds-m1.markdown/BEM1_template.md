# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I set out to cement the murky knowledge i had amassed in the previous mod. There are still some kinks, albeit very simplistic ones. I have finally been successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled with connecting the fundamentals to elaborate relationship chaining. I learned exactly where my problems were and worked through them to come to my current level of understanding.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project was credit check. It was rather simple but that simplicity allowed my fluidity. I was able to achieve the goal with more complex code because i knew exacltly what i was doing. My least favorite was battleship because the connectivity was so pronounced that i became overwhelmed.
What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned, again, exactly where my problems were.
What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned that others were similarly afflicted. I dont know if it was by design, or random, but my partner also struggled with the same thing as myself.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite gear up was the one about cognitive resources. I completely understood the belief of reserving "resources" for the more elaborate things by not wasting them on the simple problems. My least favorite was the one about introversion v extroversion as it basically forced either party to parle.
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I contributed to turing by being a relatable student. There is this pressure that we face for excellence, aka passing, and by failing I was able to show that not everyone is always successful and that is ok
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to actually contribute to some of the coding showcases. Im understanding complex things more so now so I feel as if i could contribute more
