## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

To learn from my mistakes I made last mod and pull through and pass this time. I definitely learned from my mistakes minus Battleship again and passing is yet to be determined.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

When I started to hit a wall and wanted to give up. I learned to just keep going. The struggling helps me learn even though it feels like it doesn't in the moment.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was Black Thursday. Even though it was probably the hardest and took the most time. You really get to see everything you learned put into practice and that is a really good feeling once you start getting in the groove of things. My least favorite was Battleship. I got too easily overwhelmed and didn't seek as much help as I needed. Which was the same mistake I made last time.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

Working with someone else makes doing this a lot easier.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

Working by myself makes doing this a lot harder.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

The growth mindset one was my favorite. It's good to hear this even for a second time. Sometimes I find myself saying in my head "You just don't understand, yet." My least favorite was the student run one. And I'm not trying to criticize them but it just seemed like they didn't exactly figure out where they were trying to go with the group discussion. Probably because they spend all their time doing schoolwork which I completely understand.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Just little things like taking out the trash or doing the dishes every once and a while. I'm also one of 4 or 5 of us in the Easley posse that shows up every week. Mostly we just use it for study time and questions.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to do at least one Code Fair.
