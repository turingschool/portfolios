## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  Learning Ruby syntax and setting a schedule for myself to get my work done. I think that I was successful. It took me a while to figure out what was going on here, as this is not like any school I've been to before, but I think in the last two weeks I've finally got a handle on that.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Working with what was given to us as far as instruction and time to complete each project + all the homework. I learned how to make my own lesson plan and fill in the gaps where I need to. I also found a lot of great people to work with in the upper mods to help me understand the ask of each project.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I liked Night Writer the best because I got to work with a team. I appreciated that back and forth and I loved the time we got to spend figuring things out. My least favorite is Black Thursday because the content is so dry. Battleship was at least fun as it was relatable. Difficult, but relatable.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  How to set timers for myself, how to go look for help.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned a lot as I learn best by talking it out. My teammates have been wonderful in brainstorming and whiteboarding, and when we've gotten things down on the editor, they've gone well. I learned to be able to drive and navigate, and I've learned about Github branches as well.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  The "Not so subtle art" gear up was my favorite. The Mod4s who led it were great and it helped me to get through the things that would hold me back in life and at school.
  "Getting Better at Difficult Things" was my least favorite because I just don't have a "lens" that I communicate through. There are a lot of facets that I live my life through, so I'm not sure about the questions that were posed.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  As far as Turing as a whole, I participated in group lunches (productivity and Imposters), posse meetups, happy hours and I went to see speakers. I contributed to the conversations and made suggestions to my classmates as was appropriate.
  However, I feel like it was a missed opportunity for the instructors to sit out the improv day and happy hour(s). We are a close mod, and I know the instructors have a lot to do, but getting to know them is part of creating a community here. If the students always feel like the instructors are the "other", there is no chance for unity. I would have appreciated that option to get to know them better in all the activities.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I've been approached to do the Imposters lunch, and I would be delighted to do so. I hope to continue to do other lunches, posse meetings, happy hours and seeing speakers. I'm also volunteering at RMR and attending Denver Startup Week over the break.
