## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

In the beginning, I came into this module wanting to absorb all that I could about Ruby programming - doing as much studying and practice ahead of time before starting the module to make sure I was comfortable and successful. I feel very good about where I am and how far I've come. I knew that the experience was going to be a challenge one way or another, but I didn't expect the teaching style to be what it was. In no way am I saying I feel the teaching style was poor, but rather the style was intentionally reserved to enable the students to adopt and take on the habits of figuring out things on their own - much like how they would do in a real work setting when they move on from Turing. I think I was successful in getting what I could out of this mod, I even think I got more than I expected - learning so much in a small amount of time, and also reshaping how I approach learning and solving problems.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think I struggled most with accepting the style of the curriculum. Yes it was fast paced, I just with I had more time to catch up on homework assignments because I felt like I was missing out on valuable information that would better help me get through some of my projects. Through the struggle I definitely learned how to prioritize and maximize the time I spend here.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects this module were both of the paired projects, Night Writer and Black Thursday, because I feel I learn most when collaborating with others. My least favorite was Battleship, because I'm disappointed I didnt finish.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

From my independent projects, I learned how to single handedly find things out on my own and what resources fit best for how I learn. I also learned how to drop my pride and reach out to others when I need help.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned about collaboration, git workflow, task management techniques, and lots of shortcuts form my paired projects.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was the one about Developer Identity, because it touches on creating an 'identity' (of course) for yourself when I finish my time at Turing and it motivates me to start thinking about what industry route I take as I go on to later mods. My least favorite was probably Strengths and Storytelling, simply because I have a hard time talking about myself - but I guess that's the point of that specific Gear Up session.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I had the opportunity to participate in SAB, and through that I was able to in one way or another help my cohort mates, bringing them together and helping those who may be too reserved to reach out to the right people, acting as a median for them.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to continue participating in SAB so I could continue to help my cohort mates. I would also like to do as much as I can to help the next Mod 1 group, the same way uppermods helped me when I was too stubborn to reach out on my own.
