<Takeaways, your experience>
Self Directed

I thought this project was a good introduction about the information that's being transferred between requests and responses.
I enjoy working with groups because I feel I learn from others and at a faster rate/
B: Group Work & Projects
Rales Engine

I think the concept of this project is more realistic to what our experiences will be like when we begin working as developers. I almost think that there should be a smaller scale version of this earlier during the Turing Experience. I myself had a great experience, which is possibly why I feel that way. Regardless - it's any eye opening project on the importance of working around limitations.
