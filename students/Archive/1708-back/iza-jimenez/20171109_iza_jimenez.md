## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  At the beginning of this module I didn't really have anything specific that I set out to accoplish other than solidifying what I already know about Ruby, extending my knowledge into Rails/SQL/ActiveRecord, immersing myself fully into the curriculum, and making myself available to Mod1 whenever they needed assistance of any kind (paying it forward for how the Mod above me always made themselves avaiable whenever I had questions). Looking back, there was so much more to Mod2 than I could have imagined and there's still so much I want to go back over. I feel confident with the material that I've been presented, and I actually enjoy building everything out, but there's still so much more content that I want to go back over and master - or as Sal would say, "know cold." I felt my time was extremely valuable throughout Mod2 and I feel like there isn't enough time in the day for me to cover as much as I want - there's still so much more I'm curious about!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  The thing I struggled most in this module was adapting to working in larger groups. In Mod1, projects were paired, but here groups consisted of either 3/4 people. While I enjoyed the expereience as far as learning different techniques from each partner, I admittedly did struggle with being able to coordinate with that many people via GitHub. Making sure that no work was duplicated and any merge conflicts that occurred were resolved in the appropriate manner was a struggle initially - but over time and learning from different people I was able to overcome those struggles.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My most favorite project during this module would have to be the final project. I really appreciated my partners in how they committed as much time as needed for the project (at school and remotely), and were always present, respectful, patient, and available for each other. Each partner had a lot to bring to the table and collaborated as smoothly as any group could with one another. I think we were all in sync with with one another as far as communication, expectations, thought processes, and workflow.

  The least favorite project from this Mod would have to be the first project. There were various factors that were involved as far as answering why, but they all primarily dealt with this idea of 'discomfort'. While I think it was a learning experience for everyone in my group, I think most of the obstacle could have been resolved if we overcame our own discomfort. I think my team was simply unfamiliar with working in a 4 member group, so essential things like communication, dividing up tasks, and expedeiting the overall progression of the project was a struggle. If we all had communicated with one another and spoke openly about each others struggles we would have been able to help each other out - but I think since the material was so new that we all weren't sure how to handle helping each others issues given our different levels of understanding. I felt relatively comfortable with understanding the material, but there was a member in my group that was at a much higher level than myself. While I did try to understand the clever and elaborate methods that this person was developing, it was a struggle for the group trying to understand those methods and trying to continue coding from those methods they didn't fully understand.

  In all honesty it was difficult at the time, but with this more in depth understnding that I now have after completing this Mod, I'm able to look back and really understand what's happening in those methods that my partner created. I'm happy to have been able to work with them and having experienced being in a group with them and seeing their code unfold - I feel like I've learned so much and have become a better programmer because of it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  When it comes to the independent projects this Mod, I wouldn't say I learned as much as working with others. While I did still learn a lot, I would say most of it was taking what I learned from other in my paired projects, refining it by doing more research on those concepts, and finding out the specifics of what works and why. Independent projects allows me to refine and chisel what I learn from others, and it also allows me to breathe, learn, and do research on my own and at my own pace - which I often need because I enjoy hand-writing pages and pages of notes.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  From my paired projects, I learned that there needs to be a balance - specifically pertaining to strengths. In my first project, it was a group of 4 and according to our Clifton Strenths results, there wasn't really an 'initiator' in the group - so it was somewhat of a struggle to keep the flow of the project moving forward in a smooth and collective manner. As far as my last project, I was able to learn so much about many different CSS/HTML techniques from both of my partners, as well as a few different resources and tools available to help better myself and my workflow. I really just enjoy working with others because I'm able to learn so much from them - I'm able to learn about what they've tried (that I may or may not have otherwise heard about) and what does/doesn't work for them and try them out for myself.


## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  I think my most favorite gearup would be the Social Movements In Tech gearup. I come from an industry that is very shallow with little care for the good of the overall culture of society. So being able to gain insight into what is in place in the tech industry relating to solving problems for the overall good of others helped me understand that the skills that we learn in this school are relevant and can really impact those who aren't as fortunate.

  There wasnt a gear up up that I would choose to be my 'least favorite' but if I had to choose one it would be the Tragedy of the Commons. I think having conversations about diversity in the industry are important, but the way the gear up was presented was very biased and one sided and the converstion didn't really present anything close to a possible idea of a solution to the problem. The Paradigm of the Polygons was interesting, but the concept isn't something that could be narrowed down to a simple game - diversity is much more complicated than two different shapes.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I came in really wanting to help out MOD1 as much as I could, wether it be guiding them thorugh the right throught processes on a project, giving them advice, or assisting them in coping with their adjustment into the Turing 'lifestyle'. I think I've done that by being friendly and open with them, and making myself not only available but also approachable. I've also had the pleasure of once again taking part in SAB. It's really helped me gain insight on what the tech culture is like, expecially coming from an art/retail background. Participating in SAB has also allowed me to organize groups and be selfless - as well as think about my own cohort as a whole, and attend to their best interests. I think that actively participating in SAB has helped me practice my speaking and collaboration skills, and it's helped me see that the student body really makes this school what it is.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  Next module I would like to be able to continue contributing to helping assist the Mod behind me. Since all the experience I gained in Mod2 will still be fresh, I want to make sure that I'm as available to help them as much as the Mod above me was able to assist me. Next module, even though I wont actively be able to participate in SAB anymore, I still plan on being involved in the community by always listening to the voices of other students, helping to lift other students and bringing together groups who share the same interests and opening those groups up to others in the rest of the student body who may also share the same interests, the same way I brought together those who share an interest in yoga. I thought that having a weekly yoga session would help students relieve their tension and wind down on the end of every week, so sought out the right people who may be interested and now Inflexible Yogis is active and hosting yoga sessions every Friday for both students and admin.
