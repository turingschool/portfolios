# Emily Wise - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 My goals this module were the following:
  -  Databases: strong proficiency with ActiveRecord queries and writing SQL queries to analyze information. Stretch goal Data visualization.
  - API consumption: strong proficiency with consuming external APIS, testing, and creating dynamic reusable services. Stretch goal, utilize caching and other techniques to reduce calls and increase performance.
  - API architecture: strong proficiency with creating internal APIs and test endpoints.
  - Testing Driven Development: focus on following the TDD and BDD process, and seek ways to make testing more robust
  - Community: co lead project with the Pahlka Civic Tech group at Turing. Start to develop  a project succession plan for backend team
  - OOP: strong proficiency with building Rails application, and creating classes, services, methods, etc. that are scalable.
  - Agile Processes: functional knowledge of building applications and workflow from user stories.

## Self-Assessment

  | Section | Category | Score |
  | --- | ----- | --- |
  | A | **End-of-Module Assessment** |3|
  | B | **Individual Work & Projects** |2-3|
  | C | **Group Projects** |3|
  | D | **Professional Development** |3|
  | E | **Feedback & Community Participation** |2-3|

  Overall, I have learned an immense amount this module and many concepts are starting to solidify. I feel more comfortable with diagnosing problems as well as doing more self-directed learning. I feel comfortable with building internal APIS and analyzing data with SQL and ActiveRecord. My overall familiarity with the Rails framework has also greatly improved. I am also recognizing areas in my code that should be extracted out, etc. to follow more of the OOP principles.
  There are still so many concepts that we touched on that I did not get to implement in projects, that I look forward to further working through and adding to future projects- such as background workers, rails security, working with the DOM, more consumption of external APIs, overall system designs. I wish I would have been able to implement some of these in my Mod 3 projects, but was not able to within the timeframe. I recognized that I was more mentally fatigued this module, and I am not sure if it was due to some of the holiday schedules and/ or it being the end of 4 months of the program.


## A: Individual Work & Projects

  > **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**

  I was able to consume the API, and understand how to use headers, params etc. to extract the information needed. I learned the process of using tools like Postman and Rails console to understand how the data is coming in and and what stage in the code. I have a strong grasp on Oauth and how to implement it in projects.

  I appreciated that I was not graded, and I look forward to work on this project moving forward to create more complex views that rely on data from multiple endpoints.

  > **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**

  My application is a tool for companies to use to promote unbiased and standardized interviews with the goal of reducing bias in this step of the process. The tool mimics best practice principles from the Head of People Ops at Google. I was able to create the basic forms and interfaces for the HR admin and the Interviewers, but I would like to continue to work on the application to add analytics, and Peer Feedback review template, as well as a tone analyzer. I also see a lot of opportunity to pull a lot of the code out of the controllers and put into creator objects. Right now the application is also set up for one company, and would like it to be able to handle multiple users. I would also like to be able to implement more security as well.

  This was a difficult project for me. I was very excited, because this is really why I am excited about being a software developer- taking ideas on tools or processes that would add utility to business processes and then create them. I did not get as far as I had hoped. Moving forward I will work on using more time boxing techniques so roadblocks like double nested forms etc. do not derail.

  ## B: Group Work & Projects

  > **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

  This is a Turing BackEnd Mod 3 project that uses Rails to build JSON API endpoints to expose SalesEngine data. It is a Ruby on Rails application using Ruby 2.4.1, Rails 5 with Active Record, and a PostgreSQL database.

  I really enjoyed this project and was proud of the code produced. Both the architecture of the API endpoints, and the analytics using ActiveRecord were well implemented.

  > **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**

  Little Shop builds upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. We took an application that only supported one store to an e-commerce platform that can handle multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business has their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

  This was a hard project. It was very valuable experience to expand on brownfield code, but it was very challenging, and did not feel that our team was able to work on some of the more advanced user stories. I also had trouble at times finding my voice on my team, which is something that I continuously try to work on when I feel intimidated. Overall, we did not meet the functional expectations, but the learning was very valuable and more importantly how important it is for a team to have a very strong process especially when dealing with hiccups.

  ## C. **Gear Ups**

  I found the Gear Up on Micro aggressions to be very impactful. My key takeaway is that the conversations need to be practiced, and that I need to push myself at Turing to not only understand more of how my words might be micro aggressions, but to also practice being an ally in conversations when I hear them.

  I found the Attention Economy gear up to be an interesting conversation with classmates, but I didn't come away with as many tangible takeaways.

  ## D: Community Participation

  #### **Community Contribution Option**

  I frequently pair with mentors, and went to a hackathon during intermission. I have also worked with students in lower mods to work over their code. Even though not listed as an option, my participation with Pahlka is a contribution to the Turing community.

  #### **Posse**
  I struggle to find a lot of value with the Posse. We have had a very low participation, so my contribution is going and just interacting with other students in different modules.

  #### **Playing a Part**

  I am active with Joan Clarke Society. I also worked with Aurora to re-start the Pahlka student group. I also worked to be available to students in Mod 1  and 2 from both a coding and mental health stand-point.
