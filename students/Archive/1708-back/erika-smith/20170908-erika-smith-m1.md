## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I really wanted to just be a sponge this module and soak up as much as I could.
A major goal for me was to learn how to work through frustration and I think I was pretty successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I definitely struggled with the frustration mentioned above.
I learned from this module how to approach a challenge and ask questions instead of quitting.
I believe that I have greatly strengthened my ability to take on challenges and look at them from several angles.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

I absolutely hated the linked list project. I really didn't feel like I learned from my struggle.
I love Black Thursday. I feel like it's a real-world challenge and I can feel myself learning as I struggle.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

How to work through a problem and struggle for a healthy amount of time, then reach out for help.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

How to slow down and ask questions to brainstorm. I've challenged myself to allow others to drive.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was the most recent one we did, which was lead by mod4 students.
I loved it because it was such a genuine and engaging conversation and it was really cool to talk to other mods.
My least favorite was probably the storytelling one.
Something I don't like about gearups is that they tend to feel very forced.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I think I did a good job of reaching out to anyone who I saw was struggling.
I feel very close to the people in my cohort and beyond, and it was really cool to immerse myself in that community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I may try to take on some leadership roles next mod. Additionally, I want to make more of an effort to go to discussions.
