# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- This module my focus was on learning how to develop more complete applications
and to challenge myself in projects by stepping outside of my comfort zone and
trying to implement new things that I learn in the process of doing, such as,
bootstap, sass, factories, etc.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Styling is what I have struggled with most in my projects.
- Learning that getting others opinions about how an application works or if it is
user friendly can be extremely helpful.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- My least favorite project was likely job tracker.
It was the first project written in rails so it was learning how rails worked,
as well as, implementing the requirements.

- My favorite project is hard for me to decide.
All of them were fun in their own way.
The group projects were great because there were a lot challenges to get through.
Looking at everything from functionality and logic to styling views.
Gif generator was a great experience too with figuring out how to
render the return from that API.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
 - Independent projects were opportunities to look more in depth into code that
 you were unclear about or to really experiment with how you wanted to personalize
 your application.
What did you learn from your paired projects?
- Paired projects were opportunities to work on how to function as a team and
use "Agile" like tools such as waffle. It also was helpful in becoming more familiar with
communicating your code, explanations and ideas more clearly.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite Gear Up would be the Cold Outreach that was put on by Mod 4.
It was nice to hear some insight from people who are in the process or who have
recently done cold outreach themselves. Listening to their advice and how they
approached people was really interesting and helpful.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- This module I tried to make myself available to Mod 1 for questions they may be having.
- Took over productivity lunch.
- Made myself available to peers in my mod whether it was trying to help in projects or
just be a friend to listen to their opinions or thoughts.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I would like to continue to build the relationships I have made and continually
be available to my peers.
- I would also like to participate in Code Fair or Demo Night in the upcoming mods.
