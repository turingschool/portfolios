What was your biggest achievement of the module?
* Proving to myself that I can learn a new language and create a complete application within 2 weeks.

What provided you with the most struggle?
* Going from a language that I understood what I was doing and having to start back on the bottom.

What did you learn from that struggle?
* I learned that even though JavaScript was a new language and that I didn't know how to write it, there were parallels that could be drawn from Ruby and Rails applications that assisted in understanding the language of JavaScript.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
* Being able to access my situation and my needs and having the ability to follow what is in my best interest to continue forward productively.

How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing?
* I really enjoyed learning JavaScript and would like to find a position that is more full-stack because I want to be able to be a part of both front-end and back-end of projects.

How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
* Learning a new language helped in solidifying the core concepts of programming. For instance, both a Rails application and an Express application deals with routes, but both handle and organize this process differently.

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
* Programming is a vast subject and though it may never be mastered, I have the skills and the ability to learn new languages  apply what I learn quickly.
