## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
	This module my goal was to adjust to being a programmer and learning how to understand ruby. While, yes there is always more to learn, I believe I have grasped key conceps that allow me to read, understand, and think through code.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
	One of the struggles I faced this module was simply adjusting to Turing's style of teaching. It is unique to any other learning environment that I have experienced.
	It has taught me how to adjust to intaking information at a rapid pace.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
	Night Writer and Date Night have been my favorite. 
	Both were challenging in their own ways, but overall I feel like taught me the most too.
	My least favorite, was likely black_thursday due to its repetitious nature and adding new classes and such often broke pre-existing classes and needed adjustments.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
	Important lessons I took away from independent projects were how to research my questions and when to ask for help. It's easy to get tunnel vision about a problem I am working on and learning when to step by and ask for help is important.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
	Working in pairs has it's own unique set of challenges. I think the main take aways from working in pairs are that everyone has their own style for learning, attacking a problem, and working with others. It's learning to adjust to what is the most productive for all parties involved.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
	My favorie gear-up was talking about the diversity gap. It brought a lot of awareness and a new prospecitive to consider not just here at Turing, but also later in our jobs. 
	Getting better at difficult things or growth mindset was my least favorite. Only having one of them would be okay. I thought that they were very similiar and repetitious. 


How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
	This module I tried to be supportive to my fellow classmates. Whether their troubles were technical or emotional, I did my best to be supportive and encouraging. Letting them know that they weren't alone in experiencing whatever problem they were facing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
	I would like to be able to assist in more technical problems. This module I feel like I have learned a lot and hope to pass on the things I learned to new students.
