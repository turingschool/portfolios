# Miguel Silva - M3 Portfolio

  This module I wanted to become better at consuming API's and building them. Also I wanted to network more and attend to more meet-ups.

In my group projects, I learned that the tech industry is not just about skills, but also social skills. It is also important to know how to work in a team and not let our emotions get the best of us.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

 [APIcurious](https://github.com/MiguelSilva1997/APICurious)
 This project was very helpful on teaching me the right way of consuming and building an API.

## B: Group Work & Projects

[Rales Engine](https://github.com/MiguelSilva1997/rails_engine)
  The Rails Engine API allows you to query metadata and perform business analytics on merchants, invoices, invoice items, items, customers, and transactions.

  This was another individual project and I found it really helpful, because it had more complex ActiveRecord queries.

[The Pivot](https://github.com/MiguelSilva1997/the_pivot_base)
Little Shop builds upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. We took an application that only supported one store to an e-commerce platform that can handle multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business has their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

During this project I learned the importance of working as a unit in the tech industry. Even thought we run into problems, I got a lot from it.

## C. **Gear Ups**

 [Link To Gear Up]()
The Gear Ups this module where really useful. They thought me a lot about the tech industry. They prepared me more to confront an interview with more confidence.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
This module I contribute more by helping other mods. I paired a total of 4 times with them to help them in thei current projects. Also, I gave a spike talk to module 1 about self and how to use pry.

#### **Posse**
My posse was really helpful to relax. We helped each other by creating an inclusive environment where all of us felt comfortable. We helped each other with lightning talks and projects.

#### **Playing a Part**
I contributed to the community by making myself present and making myself available to others.
