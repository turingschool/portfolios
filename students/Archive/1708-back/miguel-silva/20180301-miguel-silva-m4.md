# What was your biggest achievement of the module?
  * I believe my biggest achievement this module was my final project. Looking back in retrospect, my capstone prove to me that I can teach myself new technologies by just putting time and effort into it. I see that learning the basics of programming is more important than learning the language itself. The importance on falling in love with the process instead of your goals is key to success.

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * One of the biggest struggles hit tat the beggining of module 4. I felt tired, burnout and stressed out. None the less I reminded myself that I have been in this position before. There is this beautiful thing that comes out when you burst out of your box. That thing is growth. The simple fact that I now look back and remember that I did not know anything about programming and all the new things I have learn to just come to realize that I still do not know anything about programming its a weird feeling. Weird only because, I have expanded my horizon yet again to just realize there is still a lot to come.

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
  * I have always been proud of my dedication and my attitude towards new challenge. I believe that I am a leader at heart and one of the biggest qualities of being a leader is to be able to go first. My goal in every journey that I decide to take is to not only be succesful, but to leave my current environment looking better and stronger.

# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
  * My goal after Turing was to learn and become a Software Engineer. Module 4 just proved to me that I can become a full stack developer instead of picking one side. I also believe that my past modules where key to my learning. In every single one of them I focused on learning new things and push myself to go above and beyond the curriculum, but the curriculum in each module kept me in check and remind me to always go back to my basics.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
  * The most important lesson I will take after turing is the ability to tackle challenges. To work hard and the rest will come. To not stress out but to keep going and find solutions to problems that people are encountering.
