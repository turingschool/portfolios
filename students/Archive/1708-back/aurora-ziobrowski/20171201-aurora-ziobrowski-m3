>* \<Takeaways, your experience>This mod was maybe my favorite--I liked the diversity of the projects we worked on, the instruction was great overall, and it didn't feel so shockingly new. Mod1 is obviously just kind of wild, Mod2 is all brand new with rails, and Mod3 was really just building on what we learned in Mod2, so that was kind of neat to get to go a bit more in depth.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>A mouse tracker for a neurological lab for mouse CRUD functionality and analytics
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>It's really different making something for a user vs. for project requirements. Javascript includes a lot of syntax.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>Building an API
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>It was a good introduction to building APIs, and it was good to have the learning split into building vs. consuming.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>Working on brownfield
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>When things seem to be behaving inconsistently, you should figure out why, or else everything will be broken beyond repair by the time to stop to figure it out. Also, sometimes you should just start over.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently for each gear up>
Microaggressions: Mostly choosing not to overlook small commentary, whether its directed at you or others.
Attention Economy: Again, I think just being cognizant of how I choose to use my time and consume my resources.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
I pair one to three times a week with students from Mod1-Mod3 (although mostly Mod1). I really like pairing--I like maintaining connections with students from other mods, and I always like sharing knowledge back and forth.

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>We had mentors come in to speak with us about real world experiences.
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>Lola is a very dedicated posse lead, and I appreciate them.
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>It's always good working with a diverse group of people.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community> I've led Pahlka posse this mod--we got the organization off the ground, had mentors come in to help, and many of us started our projects.
