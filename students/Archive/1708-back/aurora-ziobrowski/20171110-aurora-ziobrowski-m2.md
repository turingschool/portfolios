# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I mean, to pass the mod? I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

Otherwise, I honestly don't think I knew what to expect heading into this mod or what it was really about, so I'm not sure I really set out to accomplish anything except really just to learn the things. Which I did! I spent most of the mod just feeling like a disaster, but I think that at this point, I feel confident enough that I can actually build a web app, which is PRETTY AMAZING. There's still so much that I don't know, but I'm at least at a point where I know the questions to ask/google, or can trial and error my way through things.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Hmm. You know, I think I struggled the most with the fact that I was struggling as much as I did. Mod 1 was stressful and overwhelming, but I felt confident that I at least knew what I was doing and what was happening. This mod, I felt like I was just kind of flopping around in the dark for the first four weeks, with no clue about what was actually happening or whether I knew enough. So I guess the lesson was 1) kind of a reminder of the whole growth mindset thing, and 2) being okay with being uncomfortable for an extended period of time. It doesn't feel great, but it's a good lesson that things get better, and that you're learning things even when you feel like you're not. I imagine having a real developer job will feel like this for a while too.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Most Favorite: Rails Mini Project-- because it was maybe the project where I started to feel things click, and also because I got to choose my own topic. It was neat getting to work on a project that I was actually interested in (not that I have anything against San Francisco bikes and all).  And yeah--just the satisfaction of building a whole product start to finish was a real sense of accomplishment.

Least Favorite: BikeShare or Little Shop, for different reasons. BikeShare because that was kind of the height of my feelings of inadequacy, and I just really felt bad and dumb at everything. And Little Shop was really stressful for me--the working dynamic of our group has been challenging for me (although both of my partners are amazing people), and I've felt a lot of pressure.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I think those are the ones where I really felt like I was getting things--maybe psychological, just proving to myself that I could do it on my own, but also because I think in group projects, you don't get to do every part of it, so you get less practice. Like in BikeShare, I basically did no styling, so that was good to get experience with in the next couple. Also, by doing the whole thing start to finish, I felt like I was getting a more fluid picture of how everything fits and works as a whole app.

What did you learn from your paired projects? Some of it is interpersonal--just continuing to work with a variety of other people with different styles and personalities. Also, this mod was our first time with 3 people, which is a considerably different dynamic than working in pairs, in my opinion. I thought BikeShare was actually really cool for that, because me, Marshall, and Randy are all totally different personalities and styles--and we thought it was so cool at the end that each of us basically earned our project a different 4, based on our own skills or strengths. Also, I learned a lot of just different approaches, syntax, skills, styles, etc. from seeing other people do things in different ways, which is really cool.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Most favorite: the one on privilege.  It's really good to have an explicit reminder that our walks in life are different, and we had a really thoughtful, meaningful conversation as a group afterwards.

Least favorite: the polygons one. I like the message a lot, but we just spent a really long time reading, and I'm not sure that the discussion facilitation was completely as meaningful as it could have been.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I think connecting with Mod 1 was one way--I remember that my commitment to community last mod was paying the help that I had gotten forward. Also, I'm kind of proud of restarting Pahlka--I think there are a lot of members of the Turing community (including myself) who are excited to be a part of the organization, and to see what can be done with our likeminded service orientation + some cool cross-mod, cross-program collaboration. I think it's going to be a neat opportunity to bring a lot of different Turing students together.

What would you like to do to contribute next module? Keep going with Pahlka. Make sure that Beryllium keeps going, even if I have to do it myself. Keep being a resource for soon-to-be Mod2, and also to reach out to incoming Mod 1.
