## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to pass the mod. I was not successful

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled most with individual projects and paired assessments. I learned that I need to dedicate more time to practice and hone my abilities. I generally would get stuck on one method or one iteration and have trouble moving past this. I generally can grasp about 80-90 percent of the material, but certain issues like setting up tests incorrectly or failing to iterate through a nested has correctly really held me up and held me back.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite project: Black Thursday. I learned so much from Miguel and how to make connections between previously unconnected data via methods, self, and iterating.

Least favorite project: Battleship. I learned the least on this project because of A. Lack of time and commitment to pushing through obstacles. Lack of understanding of how to connect classes. Lack of planning. Lack of experience with terminal ASCII interface.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to ask for help. I learned what anxiety and imposter syndrome are first hand. I learned that I need to spend more time at school where I have more resources to pull from.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned how to struggle and deal with stress more effectively.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite Gear up was Transhumanism put on by mod 4. Less structure promotes more engaging conversation. Many disagreed but everyone was respectful and could learn from opposing views.

Least Favorite: I honestly didn't have any that I hated. I thought there was something to gain from all of them if one engaged.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was my absolute whole self. I tried to remain approachable, engaging, and generally optimistic towards my peers. I engaged with them outside of school and helped those who were going through rough patches. I attempted to meet someone new every day, and I asked intriguing questions to mentors and Jeff when I was presented with the opportunity. I engaged and encouraged my peers at the code fair. I put aside my own shortcomings this mod, so that I could encourage and support my peers that had success. I engaged every day in class even when I was tired and/or frustrated. I helped keep the overall mood of the class positive and I provided honest feedback when asked.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to offer more technical help to others in need. I'm certainly not an expert, but I feel much better today than I did at any point in the mod. I hope to offer advice on productivity and time management via the experience of my own mistakes. I will continue to engage and be present for all of my peers and instructors.
