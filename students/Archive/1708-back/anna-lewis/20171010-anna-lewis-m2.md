## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

This module, I mainly wanted to understand how the internet works and how Rails allows us to build applications with Ruby code that can be rendered in the browser. I also wanted to build relationships with module one students because I enjoy helping others and learn best when describing a topic to someone else. I would say that I still feel that the world wide web is largely a mystery to me (and probably will always be, in some sense), but at least now I have this understanding of requests and responses and how information is passed between client and server. I do feel like I have had the chance to help several module one students and I hope that I can continue to do so in the future. I was also able to benefit from the relationships I established since I wrote my blog post to address an audience at a level of programming similar to mid-module 1 Ruby. It was helpful to have a module 1 student review it to make sure I was communicating at an understandable but hopefully now condescending level.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**

I think my most pressing struggle this mod was one that has been fairly cyclic for me. That is, managing my depression and anxiety in a way that I can have stumbles and get right back up and running. Overall, each time I experience one of these cycles, I think I manage to learn from it and improve. This time around, I learned that if I have to miss a day, it is beneficial for me to force myself to work in a public space such as a coffee shop or library in order to not completely withdraw. Getting out of the house and accomplishing even a small task allows me to more confidently attend class the next day and prevent a snowballing effect.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

My least favorite project was probably job_tracker, through no fault of its own. Since companies and part of jobs were already setup, I let myself do a lot of referencing from these. I might have learned more if I had forced myself to avoid looking at the code for these. I also waited until the end of the project to write tests, mostly because we were still in the process of learning about testing (or at least that's how I rationalized it to myself). This resulted in me hardly understanding error messages in my terminal and doing most of my debugging in the console provided when a page is unable to render. This was all very evident in my mid-mod assessment.

My favorite projects this module were bike_share and the rails_mini_project. I liked bike_share because it was both my first time coding in a group larger than two people and also because it was my first time actually putting something in my browser (the 'hello, world' one I made previously doesn't count). I really enjoyed learning about project management tools and how to more effectively use Pull Requests. It was something that I hadn't looked into much, but being in a larger group meant that I saw the impact these tools could have. I also really enjoyed the rails_mini_project because I got to go outside my comfort zone and try to make my own guidelines for a project. I find that I do well with user stories, but I want to work on my ability to propose ideas and think about what makes a good application. I really struggled with this project, but I would aslo argue that it is the project that I learned the most from: both because of implementing my own ideas and because I tried to focus on TDD. I also got to learn a lot about custom routes and it was cool to see exactly how I can move around a webpage.

**What did you learn from your independent projects?**

My independent projects really forced me to work on self motivation. When I'm working in a group, I tend to put in more effort because I know that what I'm doing doesn't soley affect me. I had to find my own motivations for completing work and hold myself accountable for getting things done.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?**

In my paired projects, I learned a lot about managing time and distributing work. And most importantly, how to discuss these two topics. It was really hard for me to explain to my group that my productivity comes in bursts so one day might be really slow for me and the next super productive. I didn't enjoy requesting time to do things in the evenings the first two days of the little_shop project. It made me feel like a slacker and worry that Aurora and Josi's opinion of me would be permanently lowered. However, I managed to request time to do personal activities and it was validating to really contribute towards the end of the project. I am working towards understanding that I can't focus on one thing for two weeks and I need to make sure other aspects of my life keep on track as well.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**

My favorite Gear Up was the one on diversity. I really enjoyed the polygon exercise since I'm a visual learner and I could really see what was happening. I also feel like this is a topic that really forces me to think. As someone who applied to a professional school, it used to be really frustrating to watch schools accept someone with lower test scores or less volunteer hours because of some demographic. While I have moved past this view, it was really impactful for me to see what an impact conciously trying to increase diversity can have.

My least favorite Gear Up was the one on empathy and privilege. I think it is an important topic, but feel that true empathy can't be gained simply by talking about it. In addition, although I think privilege needs to be discussed, I always find these discussions frustrating. This is because so many small things play a part in how someone views and interacts with the world that it's very hard to define where privilege lies. For example, I grew up with a father that worked with SQL. While many would think this positively impacts my involvement in tech, the truth is that I saw him come home from work every day stressed. He would tell me that he just has a job to make money to support his family and do things outside of work. Similarly, while many would see my depression as a hinderence (and it sometimes it), I also think that it taught me so much about empathy. In addition, it also forced me to focus on self-care, which I had been ignoring for most of my life in favor of accomplishments. In a way, I think privilege is a murky topic that can draw focus away from the individual and their personal story.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

I want to say that starting work on a pairing application is one way I contributed and want to continue to contribute. I think one of the hardest thing for me is reaching out to someone for help and depersonalizing the request might make it easier to ask. I think the idea is a useful and would like to continue to work on this project on the side to review my Rails knowledge over break.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I'm going to say the say thing I did last module, because I wasn't able to work something out. I'd like to work towards hosting a GDI code & coffee event at Turing with the help of JCS.
