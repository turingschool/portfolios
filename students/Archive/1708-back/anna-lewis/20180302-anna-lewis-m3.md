# Anna Lewis - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> My general goal this module was to maintain my mental health, as that was the largest inhibitor to completing the module previously. In addition, I wanted to make progress on career prep and (following the general expectations of the mod) learn to work with APIs.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 2 (3 on cleanup after) |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2 |

>* Work on community engagement more next module
>* I thought it would stress me out more to have to go back and cleanup the end-of-module assessment when I could be working on my personal project, but it actually took a huge weight off of my shoulders. I didn't realize how much my not-skinny-at-all controllers were hanging around the back of my mind until I refactored. Note to self: refactoring can feel good, so you should take the time to do it, because functionality isn't everything.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* Overall, this went much better than last mod. I think having previous experience going in allowed me to figure out where the gaps in my understanding were widest and work towards understanding those areas. I didn't complete the entire functionality, but I think that by going slower on specific features I was able to gain a better understanding of the overall process of API consumption. I really liked that this was not evaluated so that I could take this path.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I really struggled with the Google API for a large portion of my project, so it felt really rewarding to get that up and running. I tried using Pivitol Tracker to manage my project and found this really messed up some of my estimates. It was difficult for me to pick and choose what features to implement in the time I was given. I signed up to demo this project from the start, so it was interesting to see how my mindset was changed by having a "deadline".

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* I worked with Nico on this project and found the second go around much better than the first. We chose to work through almost all of the business logic endpoints together which, while possibly slowing us down a bit, definately helped my understanding. We developed a flow of whiteboarding our ActiveRecord queries and feel like I came away understanding database manipulation much better.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Like in the last mod, I really started struggling during this project. I had some personal things come up and one of the most stressful things to me is the thought of letting others down. I find that I do some of my best work in group projects because of this drive, but it can also really have a big impact on my mental health. Communicating with my group members early and often was really helpful in managing this stressor. I feel like I learned a lot about working on an existing project and while I would say this was one of my least favorite projects, I also have to admit that it was one of the most helpful, especially in regards to the non-technical aspects of being a developer.

## C. **Gear Ups**

>* [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)
Microagression talks are always the hardest for me, because if someone doesn't think something was a microagression, it's very hard to change their mind. I appreciated the initial layout of rules for the session and that everyone seemed open to the discussion. I think the most important take-away for me is that microagressions are different for every individual, so really the only way to counter them is to 'over'-communicate.
>* [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
The biggest take-away from this for me was that when just 10% of people make a concious attempt to bring in more diversity, there is a huge impact. This is such a small percentage, how can I not try to make a difference when what I do could have such an impact?
>* [Learning Through Teaching](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/Learning-through-Teaching.md)
When aking the time to think about how often I teach as a strategy to learn, I always come up with the answer that it's not enough. Upon reflection, next mod I would really like to work on pairing more and also reviving Beryllium.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
> One of my goals was to introduce myself to mod 1 backend students directly throughout the first few weeks of the module, which (hopefully) helped them feel like they had someone to reach out to if needed. I was able to pair with a few of those students.

#### **Posse**
> Put in a request to start a tech blog posse - not a whole lot of attendence, but it has helped me work towards my goal to publish more blog posts and I like that there is an open time/location that other can go to for some peer review/brainstorming.

#### **Playing a Part**

> Overall, I feel like my contribution was fairly low this mod. I tried to encourage others to come to meetups with me and show off their projects. I also try to post my notes if a lot of diagraming is done and others might not have gotten everything down. For next mod, I would really like to make Beryllium BE happen again, because I have been mooching off of the front-enders to learn JS several times over the week.
