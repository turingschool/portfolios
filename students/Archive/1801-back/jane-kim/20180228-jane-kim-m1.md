# (Jane Kim) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming from a non-programming background, I planned to come into this Module with an open mind to learn the basic skills of the fundamentals of ruby. I understood that I've never done anything in this line of work, so I expected to be pushed to my limits and out of my comfort zone. With Module one coming to an end I've realized how difficult this program actually is. I've slowly molded myself into this Turing lifestyle and feel as though I can now have a better grasp moving onto the next Modules.

## A: End of Module Assessment

For the end of Module Assessment I was not proficient enough to pass the assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This section will include all of the individual projects I did during Module one. For each project there will be links to the project specs and my repositories, along with the details about my evaluations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This section will hold the projects I completed with a partner/group while in Module one. It will also provide links to the projects spec and repository, along with the details of my evaluations.  

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/janeywanee/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Description:
  In this project my partner and I use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm

Assessed By: Mike

Evaluation Comments:

 - Crack runner does not work
 - Decrypt does not work
 - Test coverage at 99.43%
 - Rakefile
 - 28 tests, all passing
 - Some opportunities for refactoring, and tightening up, using loops in order to remove some of the repetition.

1. Ruby Syntax & Style
  3: Meets expectations

2. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Meets expectations

3. Test-Driven-development
  3: Meets expectations

4. Git Work flow
  3: Meets expectations

5. Functionality
  1: Well-below expectations

## D: Professional Skills

This part of the portfolio will include the programs that we were involved in during Module one. In these programs we learned new strategies that will help us with our time at Turing and as we leave. Here are the list of the key components that we covered:
  - Cultivate Self-Awareness
  - Understand one’s key strengths
  - Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
  - Ownership over one’s learning
  - Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
  - Express one’s own story and strengths
  - Manage stress effectively


### Gear Up

#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

In the Growth Mindset session I never really realized the different types of mindsets. Now knowing the differences I can pin point the times I've had a fixed mindset, and immediately I decided to change the way I've been thinking. I need to think openly and not get stuck in the fixed mindset. Since this session I haven't thought about giving up during hard times, instead I've been asking myself what can I do differently so I don't feel this way or learn things better.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

When I first started Turing I wasn't doing so well with managing my cognitive resources. At the time my vision was to just get things done and be on top of everything. Sooner than later I realized I was getting burnt out fairly fast. Now that I have a little bit more knowledge on cognitive resources I feel like I have more power on how to use my resources efficiently.

#### (Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

From the beginning I knew I leaned more toward the introverted side, and I've had past instances of when it became a problem. If I or other people knew how to work with people who are introverted or extroverted I feel like it would make things way more smooth going. This session really helped with understanding how introvert and extroverted people think. I also learn how to properly work with one who is more introverted than I or extroverted.

#### (Storytelling & Strengths (StrengthsFinder))

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling)

This session was kind of about our story. How we got here and how our story relates with the software industry. Coming into this session it made me realize that we all had different situations for how we ended up at Turing, but all of our responses for wanting to be there were all about the same.

#### (Code: Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

When I first thought about being part of the tech industry I knew it was a male dominated field, because of that I did have a few outlooks about it. I will have to say I was a little intimidated however, Turing has made it such a comfortable and open environment for me. Being asian and female I feel like it is helping with our society and the identity of those in the industry.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In my current position I know that I'm not the best of help to give advice or help with projects, exercises, job search, interviews, to the upper classmen, but I do feel like I am helping the upper classmen by making them help me. This is helping them with extra practice and refreshers. Even though I am not the beast of help but I can sill help with what I know. I am hoping in the future to be able to the best help there is. I do want to be apart of this community and want to see other succeed.
