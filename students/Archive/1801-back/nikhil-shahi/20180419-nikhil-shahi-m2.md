## Areas of Emphasis

### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to continue the learning momentum that I had established while repeating mod 1, while learning rails and A/R. At the same time, I wanted to reach out and help new students in mod 1 as I knew exactly what they were going through. I feel I was successful in achieving both these objectives. Mod 2 has been very interesting for me as the concepts were not difficult to grasp - but it was a lot of stuff to remember and practice. The static comp challenges were a lot of fun and have definitely stoked my interest in getting good at FE. At the same time, I feel that the Friday challenges were really good to build muscle memory and understand DB relationships like many-to-many. I actually wish we had  a couple of such one hour challenges on a weekly basis (I know it might be overkill, but I would have loved to have some more). All in all, it was a very interesting mod, with lots of new concepts. In mod 1, I used to wonder how all that logic we were learning would translate to building stand alone apps and then four weeks into mod 1, we were building our own apps like job tracker and idea box. It was very fulfilling.

### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I did not find the material very difficult, but it was just a lot to remember. I think mod 2 is a lot about practicing and committing to memory. I found it easier as the weeks progressed. I learned that practice, does indeed make perfect.

I wrote a blog on the concept of modules and mixins. The blog was geared towards beginners to help them understand the concept of modules with the aid of examples.

## Projects

### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects were IdeaBox and Job Tracker as I learnt to go through a full CRUD with authorization and authentication. I also liked Bike Share as I got to do the cart as well as use some A/R methods. My least favorite was probably Little Shop as it was within the first week of the mod when our knowledge was limited (and it also used Sinatra).

### What did you learn from your independent projects?

I loved working on IdeaBox. I was nervous about doing it on my own, but as I went through it and the lesson plans from the weeks, I was able to create a fully functional app, which was very satisfying.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?

I really enjoyed working with my peers on the paired projects. I feel I improved my git workflow as evidenced by using rebase as well as having very few merge conflicts. It was interesting to work with people having different perspectives and coming to a consensus on methodologies.

## Community

### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite Gear Up was 'Empathy and Privilege'. I really liked this session as it exposed me to how people in our society might experience marginalization or privilege based on their background or other attributes. It made my peers and I aware that we need to develop empathy with respect to privilege, which will help us in interacting with others and make a positive difference in their lives.

My least favorite Gear Up was 'Finding Meaningful Common Ground'. We learnt how to interact with others in a social or networking environment and to understand how to start a conversation with a complete stranger. I was hoping it was more to do with how to resolve conflict of ideologies and come to a consensus.

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

One of the great things about Turing has been the plethora of teachers, mentors and peers that have been so willing to help me out with my understanding of the subject matter. Wanting to pay it forward and continuing my tradition from mod 1, I spent a substantial amount of my time mentoring mod 1 students and helping them with their issues. I paired with 3 to 5 students in all and spent between 6 to 8 hours a week with them, either pairing with them on project work or helping them prepare for their paired assessments. Realizing that some students were nervous about their final paired assessment, I took initiative to arrange for pairings between mod 1 students and my peers in mod 2, to simulate a final paired assessment.

### What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I look forward to continuing helping the incoming mod 1 BE class as well as the mod 2 BE students with any issues they encounter during their journey through the mods.
