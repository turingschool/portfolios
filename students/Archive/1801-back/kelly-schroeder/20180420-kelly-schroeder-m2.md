## Areas of Emphasis
GOAL: Learn how to make a decent looking, but expertly functioning website. Learn how to establish a dynamic database. Increase my git/hub knowledge to account for 95% of scenarios. Code every day including weekends. Get my personal life back in order(walk dogs, go to gym, cook real meals). Find something I am passionate about to start working on the design phase in anticipation of mod 3/4 projects demo night.

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  Of the goals listed above I did a pretty good job achieving them. While I didn't code every weekend day, I did spend many long days during the week(and most weekends) coding. It would still be good to code on both weekend days though; occasionally Monday mornings I could feel the rust. I feel much more comfortable with GitHub now. I feel very comfortable with my database design, creation, and management. I feel comfortable making a decent(ish) looking website, and although expertly functioning is probably a stretch I do think I am where I should be regarding my ability to make a functional application. I do have an idea for my mod 3/4 project(website that compiles all of the Denver area pet shelter pet information. Not sure if the information I need is available or even collected though). I definitely did not get my personal life back in order, if anything it is worse than it was mod 1, but until I know how to make more hours in the day or not need to sleep I am not really sure what I can do on this front. I didn't have a goal about improving my TDD skills, but I certainly advanced in this category.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Forms and param pass throughs. They were the hashes of mod 2 for me... But, just as I did with hashes, I learned to utilize my debugging tools in order to figure out what and where my problems were. I wouldn't say I'm 100% on them yet, but I no longer have a mini panic when I see 'first argument can't be empty'.

I wrote a brief comparison of static and dynamic programming languages and several of their respective advantages.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  Rails min was definitely my favorite. It was really exciting to work on a project with free range, and that I conceived. Struggling through something that was my own had a different kind of satisfaction associated with it. Also, having to do the entire thing myself significantly aided in my learning process.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned most of the rails things we needed to know. Going through the auth steps helped a lot. My biggest take away was probably an understanding of many-to-many relationships. My project had 3 join tables and this made many things throughout the rest of the mod a lot easier.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned a ton about workflow/AGILE type processes. Particularly working through bike share. It has been a lot of fun(and work!) to parse the user stories and get work assigned to multiple people, complete a story that relies on another, but still have the work pushed up from two or three people and come together on GitHub successfully.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  I really enjoyed the Digital Privacy Gear Up led by the upper mod students. It is a subject I find fascinating, and it was very pertinent given the recent Facebook issues. My interest in the subject stems more from a government consideration (remember a couple of years ago it turned out the gov was collecting everyone's calls and messages, and somehow everyone just said 'Oh, ok.' and then we moved past it?!), but as a someone who will soon work in the industry the approach our upperclassmen took is probably more relevant.

  My least favorite was the Group Think Gear Up. The entire thing felt like a practice in group think itself. I don't feel I really gained anything from the materials we read or the conversation we had. It could have been the format, as the subject itself is an interesting one to discuss. All in all I don't have a lot to say about it because it don't remember it having much substance.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I helped out mod 1 BE students when I got the chance, and I continue to develop relationships with my cohort mates. Evidently I gave a decent lightning talk, and I look forward to speaking at Turing Talks next inning!

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to be more involved in a posse. I didn't feel like I had any time this mod though. Particularly I would like to get involved with a posse that is not necessarily focused around an interest I already have. I was a bit disappointed when the posses changed from assigned to pick your own because the assigned version seemed to force people into a group of people who would likely be different and expand your knowledge base, rather than picking your own where I imagine people will congregate to interests that align closely to what they already know or like.
