# Alex Cutschall - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I want to balance both the front-end and back-end aspects on this module. I want to be successful in both
fields while also maintaining my skills obtained in Module 1 and mentoring Module 1 students.

I want to expand on my knowledge base outside of Turing with the help of mentors and possibly groups
outside of the Turing space. In conjunction with that, putting myself out there to be known by people
to help with my employability.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I was trying to tackle it in the same way that I did Module 1 and tried to learn as much
as I possibly could. I realized that I could only handle so much and it helped me focus
on certain things more than others. This process helped me to explore all of the information
in an intentional way.

Projects
  What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
    My favorite project was bike shop. There were a lot of different parts to it and everybody got
    to work on something different and then bring that project together. It felt much more like a real
    life project because if your Git Flow wasn't good, things would crash and burn. It was also cool to
    do the cart and authorization as it felt real.

  What did you learn from your independent projects?
    Doing rails mini really gave me a taste of what sort of projects that I want to build and my process
    for that. It was good because I didn't know how to tackle a project that had more loose guidelines.

  What did you learn from your paired projects?
    Working with people on a larger project and communication effectively. Being able to assign people to
    different parts of a project and trust them with that part.

  Community
  What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
    My favorite was the Networking/Outreach because I've been so excited to start reaching out to people
    and to see actionable steps to do that.
    I don't have a least favorite. They were all effective for me.

  How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I was in SAB for my second module and I helped mentor Mod 1 students.

  What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I want to enter into the Code Fair!
