## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
>Favorite: job-tracker
>Reason: It wasn't huge scale but it hammered in the important concepts for that timeframe.

>Least Favorite: Bike Share
>Reason: It was a huge scale that secluded me entirely from certain concepts, like the Cart.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
>That I'm bad at choosing my own independent projects and playing audio is kind of painful. Also some pretty tricky form stuff. I also think that my expectations of what I should be capable of probably exceed reality.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
>How to work as part of a team. How to make sure everyone is happy with what they're working on and how not to work ahead on things they want to be apart of.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
>Favorite: Networking and Outreach
>Reason: It was the first one that seemed practical and it was very well conducted. Tons of usefull information

>Least Favorite: Agile Practices and Leadership
>Reason: I don't think I picked up anything valuable from that class. I learned that management is constantly trying to scam the client by keeping projects in design-limbo and that AGILE entails being flexible in design and feedback. I don't feel like I learned how to properly implement either methodologies.
