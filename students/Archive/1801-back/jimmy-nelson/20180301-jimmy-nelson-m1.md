## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to try my hardest and learn everything I could about ruby and programming with the guidance of teachers and the advice and experiences of my peers.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first and second individual projects happened very early in the module, and I felt that I had really strong growth by the time I completed the HTTP, Yeah You Know Me project.

(description)

This was before I had a real conception of setting benchmark goals for a project and reaching out for help if I haven't met a benchmark despite persistent effort.  I did work with an upper mod student to get node placement to work after the project was due.

This project was also before I was comfortable with the git workflow, so whenever I wanted to scrap an idea I created a new file.  BST_2redux is the one where node placemenet finally worked.

(evaluation comments)

* project mostly incomplete
* encouraged to use Git for code history opposed to multiple file copies

(description)

* Created a guessing game where player posts their guess or other instructions to a website and is redirected by errors if guess or instructions do not conform to website expectations.

(evaluation comments)

* PASS
* need to focus on when to use integration tests or unit tests when testing server/client
* MUST reach out for help earlier than later for assistance, don't spin your wheels!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I was very proud of some of the breakthroughs my partner and I had on our Enigma code. While it did have limited funcitonality, I was proud of it nonetheless and learned a lot. My second group project went very well. I was pleased with the way we worked together, the way our program works, and the small size of our methods.

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jamesrnelson/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

(description)

* Created a program that encrypts and decrypts messages from the command line using a randomly generated code.  The program does not crack codes with an unknown code.

(evaluation comments)

* No Cracking
* Encrypt and Decrypt with files works well
* If/Else Structure
* ^Could have used math to avoid this
* ^Causes lots of repeated code
* Keygen not using Encapsulation
* Variables with date type
* Lots of helper methods
* No Rakefile
* Enigma does file io
* Simple Cov Not Working
* No test helper

(feedback to me)

I want to start by saying thanks for the hard work and hours put into the project. I really enjoyed working with you because the workflow went well, we saw a pair working on a project and they were arguing. We never got to that point and that shows you're an easy person to work with. I'm glad you were fine with me being gone over the weekend for the military, you did your part and was very understanding of my situation. The only thing I can say we can both do better is remote pairing, I find paired work is more efficient with time and we didn't really figure that out. I will end by saying that the next paired project, whoever you get as a partner is lucky to have someone like you to pair with.

## D: Professional Skills

During this module, I learned how to work effectively with a partner on challenging assignments using various techniques for working in person or working remotely. I have also learned the value of identifying my own strengths so that I can do my best to build on them and craft a unified personal story around them.

### Gear Up
#### (Session 1: Growth Mindset)

* [Session 1: Growth Mindset](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I already had a fair amount of background on growth mindset due to my former teaching career. This session felt a lot like preaching to the choir, but over the course of the mod I needed to keep growth mindset at the forefront of my attention because I did run into some issues where I needed to break out of former ways of thinking that were preventing my from moving forward in my understanding of ruby and programming.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [Session 2: Cohort Vision](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown)
* [Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I have felt that there is a strong sense of community at Turing. This sense of community and striving towards mutual self-betterment is necesary and effective.  It is important to consciously be aware of coginitive drain in a communty like ours where we are pushing ourselves to understand complicated material in a short timespan.  

The information presented on coginitive drain is very interesting and compelling. It can be easy to forget that immersing yourself without breaks eventually proves to be more detrimental to your learning than if you approach the learning process in a more balanced and sustainable way.

#### (Intro/Extra/Ambi-version; Managing Stress; Public Narrative)

* [Session 3: Intro, Extro, Ambi -vert styles](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)
* [Session 3: Managing Stress and Coping Merchanisms](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)
* [Session 3: Public Narrative](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)

I was very interested to participate in the Intro/Extra/Ambi -vert session because after reflection I realized that I was within the ambivert spectrum which I previously had not even heard of.  This has affected my interactions with people in a positive way because I am more aware of my natural interaction tendencies and am therefore able to overcome any difficulties or misunderstandings with my peers.

#### (Personal Story)

* [Session 4: Personal Story](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

Learning about crafting a unified story about myself was helpful. I already have a penchant for telling people stories about myself and how I got to where I am, but the value of intentionally crafting these stories for the benefit of my future employment is now well apparent to me. The part that will take more intentional effort is my social media presence, but I am working on it!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have attended and participated in every class. My classmates and I have formed a strong community of mutual aid, and we all genuinely care about each other's success in class and understanding of programming concepts.
