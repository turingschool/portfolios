# Eliot Swank - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to improve my skills in order prepare myself for Mod 2. For me, this meant a better understand of how and when best to use which methods/enums. Another goal of mine was to manage my stress level so that my anxiety didn't take over my focus. Also, I had a goal of being better connected with classmates and the Turing community in general.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Paired (high 2), Independent (2)
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I struggled with a mis-interpretation of the spec. I was under the impression for a large chunk of time during the assessment that I was supposed to bring the CSV in as a hash, when I realized too late that it was simply supposed to return a hash of two key-value pairs.

(feedback to me)

It was clear to me that you were committed to our project, and assuring to feel that we were on the same page as to the time that we needed to put in to complete the project. You were engaged and focused in each of the sessions we had together. Moreover, you were very patient; during hangups, and especially in explaining and re-explaining concepts that I did not fully grasp (e.g. those related to TDD, Github/Git Workflow, when to break out methods and how to organize classes, etc.). I also admire that you work hard to find solutions for difficult problems, but do not hesitate to reach out for help. Such as when you suggested we meet with Zac to discuss the status of our project. It allowed us to air some ideas for how we would proceed and proved to be a valuable use of our time. In reflecting on our time working together, I fear that I might have been directing too much and not listening enough. I hope you felt comfortable “challenging” my ideas and/or disagreeing with me as you saw fit. With that said, my only feedback would be that you not hesitate to speak up if you disagree with someone's thinking, want to propose an alternative approach, etc. Such as when we were working on our solution for Enigma's Crack function--your instinct was different than mine and it proved to be a fantastic solution. On the whole, it was an absolute pleasure to pair with you. Keep on keepin' on!

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This was an important concept, especially at Turing. With all the diverse backgrounds here, it's important to remember that I can do this.  I still get flustered and frustrated at times, and it helps for me to take a step back and reassure myself that I can do this.

### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I think it is essential in life before making judgement on a person or their actions to stop and consider their perspective. It seems to me that people have a tendency to make a judgement on a person's performance without considering what that other person was experience. I catch myself doing this a lot, and I feel that I can improve on this, just like everyone else.

### Gear Up
#### (Managing Stress)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Stress has been my worst enemy here at Turing. When I struggle with things, especially new things with deadlines, my stress level goes to a very high level. Learning to deal and cope with stress at this level is still a struggle for me, but now that I feel more comfortable with the material, I can focus more on the management of my stress.

### Gear Up
#### (Personal Story)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I'm not really that much of a social media guy, so I found this Gear Up session valuable and interesting. I actually look forward to building my personal brand and using the power of social media to connect with other developers for future jobs or networking opportunites.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As a Mod 1 repeater, I made myself available to the newbies for any help or advice I could give them. I really enjoy helping people the best I can, and I can't wait to be one of those mentors in upper mods for struggling lower-modders.
