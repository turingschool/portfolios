# Tyler Lundgren - M1 - Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

*  I didn't enter the module with the expectations of both immersing myself in an environment and to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of programming.  I had been working on coding on my own, but felt my progress wasn't fast enough, nor concrete enough. I feel I was successful in the first mod with my expectations, and feel I have enough of a concrete base with which to continue learning.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

* I really actually enjoyed both the last paired assessment and the final individual assessment.  I started to get sidetracked by not reading the specs correctly for the individual assessment but felt I recovered well, and was able to make up time once I got on track. At the end of it and after having some time to think about it, I was really was aware of what I would want to change to make it better. As we close out this module I feel positive about my experiences.  Looking back, I am surprised about how far we have come in six weeks.  Turing seems to always push the envelope, to never let you feel comfortable.  It was difficult but in a good way, and I feel ready for more.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

* These are the individual projects I worked on:

#### HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nergdnvlt/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

* This project was interesting for me.  It started really rough, but as I got into it, and familiar with the tools it started to make sense.  I can absolutely see the use of the project and to fumble our way through the first couple iterations.  It showed really how a simple server interacts and its functionality at a very basic level.

Evaluation comments:
* Nice to see Response as Module. While it might not be the best case to use a module, it is good to see you thinking about how to use not only classes but Modules and/or superclasses to refactor code.

* Great job separating out functionality into classes

* Style looks good. It is clear that you are thinking about the best and/or most readable way to write code, not just code that works

Scores:
* Ruby syntax and style: 3
* Breaking logic into components: 3
* TDD: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Version control: 3

#### Perilous Journey

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nergdnvlt/p_journey)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/perilous_journey)

* This project was interesting conceptually for me. The linked list data structure made sense to me, but I feel that Ruby's built-in methods for handling arrays much more intuitive to use than a linked list.  From the level of a higher level language, a linked-list almost feels like an archaic data type. However, building it made it clear how much abstraction in higher level languages makes them more human-friendly.

Evaluation comments:

* 53 tests, all passing

* Overall well structured, some methods are doing too much and are long

* Tests are well structured, although there is some redundancy and would like to see more things checked in tests, such as sequence, and the data is what we expect it to be.

Scores:
* Ruby syntax and style: 3
* Breaking logic into components: 3
* TDD: 3
* Functionality: 3

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nergdnvlt/cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards)

* For me, this project is extremely interesting to look back on: I remember struggling a lot. Not knowing what to do, nor how to do it.  At the time I had absolutely no conception of classes or methods or TDD.  All these concepts were brand new and it is incredible how much I've learned in such a short period of time. Now classes, methods, and TDD are so basic and fundamental.  It's really surprising to see how far we have actually come.


Evaluation comments:

* Assertions not specific enough (too much instance_of)

* No edge case testing

* Tests need to be more focused. Tests are testing multiple behaviors

* Runner not built up


Scores:
* Ruby syntax and style: 3
* Breaking logic into components: 3
* TDD: 2
* Functionality: 2


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* All the group projects that I was involved with:

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nergdnvlt/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

* I essentially did this project alone and really struggled with it. I think the only way I really got through it was by using my classmates as references. I am not used to having to ask for help and found being forced to ask was a really different type of challenge. It forced me to evaluate what I was really needing to ask and thus understand the problem more thoroughly. The most important technical aspect of this project to me became the methodology of passing information across each level the map through a central hub. I imagine that this skill is going to be very important going forward as all data is not going to be in the same place.  

Evaluation comments:
* Break methods up, and use best practice naming conventions.

Scores:
* Ruby syntax and style: 2
* Breaking logic into components: 3
* TDD: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Version control: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

Feedback from partner
* I would like to accentuate that I did this project almost entirely alone.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nergdnvlt/enigma-)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

* Enigma was interesting because I really enjoyed the logical challenge of the encryption. I much more enjoyed the process of reasoning out a method to encrypt data, then simply pass data around in Black Thursday.  This project also contained some data passing and parsing in regards to the key and offset, so I think I would pick this as my favorite. Another important lesson I learned from this project is that I originally built a method which was almost impossible to use for decryption - so we scrapped the entire encryption method.  It taught me, in summation: if something is not working or doesn't work the way you want it's better to just start over.

Evaluation Comments:
* Not all methods got unit tested.

Scores:
* Ruby syntax and style: 3
* Breaking logic into components: 3
* TDD: 3
* Git workflow: 2
* Functionality: 3

My feedback:
* From Manoj: It was nice working with you . The explanation you made when i was stuck  in  steps was really helpful.I was feeling a little bit behind but  after working on this project with you  i feel more confident now.  so i want to thank you  for your patience and coordination. thanks. In future, t would be great if you explain your steps before moving on.

* From Sergio: It was great to work on Enigma with you Tyler. I believe that we utilized our time wisely and that we followed the DTR as planned. I really appreciate your hard work and dedication to the project. Your collaboration and willingness to work as a team allowed us to complete the project in a timely manner. I really liked how you take your time to understand complex problems and draw them out for others to understand.  You have an ability to see things logically and determine the route you want to take. I appreciate that you also take time to listen to other ideas and incorporate them into the project. The one thing that I would focus for future projects would be to have a stronger understand of GitHub. Even though we ran into issues we managed to get through them and complete Enigma.



## D: Professional Skills

* I have a lot of solid leadership and time management skills from the Army and construction project management. However, it seems like almost everyone has these soft skills in some form or other. I want to add a set of hard skills, practical skills which there is also a market for to my repertoire.

### Gear Up

* Below are the Gear Up sessions for Module 1:

#### Mod4 - Relax

* Slack Channel: relax

* I got some really great ideas out of this Gear Up.  I had never heard of an immersion tank before and they seem intriguing. It was also interesting hearing other people's methods for relaxation and the surprise from finding similar methods in strange places. For example one of my favorite ways to decompress, especially on the bus is to put on an audiobook and zone out.  I was really surprised that other people liked audiobooks as well. Overall, though, it was good just to reinforce all these relaxation strategies by talking about them.

#### Personal Story/Strengths

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

* I had a hard time with this Gear Up, as I am a really intense introvert.  I don't particularly like sharing my story, nor talking about myself.  I do, however, understand that developing my personal story is important to tell a powerful story which will eventually assist my efforts in finding a rewarding job. Although, I think it would be more beneficial to develop the story first though, and then sharing it rather than sharing as you are trying to build it.


#### Dealing with Difference: Introvert & Extrovert

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

* The "Dealing with Difference" Gear Up was useful in the sense in that it forced us to recognize our styles in interacting with other people.  I often times have a hard time in interactions with people that I don't consider close friends. So reiterating that people are different, work differently, and handle social situations differently and that it's all ok was a worthwhile thing to do.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

* This Gear Up really resonated with me.  I was not aware that we have limited cognitive resources and thus need to prioritize our efforts.  I don't think I've ever found anything really challenging enough that I had to step back because until Turing.  Here, though, I have to do it often.  It is also something that I've enjoyed - I like being forced to think, to solve new and different problems (at least new to me).

#### Growth Mindset

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

* I love growth mindset. And I love the emphasis people are putting on it these days.  I don't really believe in positive reinforcement - I would rather know what I need to do better. Also though, I think esteem should be self-generated, and the best way that I have experienced this is by using a growth mindset.  I know there are limitations; but my general belief in life is that if someone else can do something, I can do it as well. I also think it is a mindset that places importance in keeping perspective: just because you hit an obstacle or roadblock does not mean it is insurmountable. A lot of times all it takes is effort and hard work.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

* This mod, I was essentially just trying to get my bearings and find a path forward. I have formed some really good friendships that I already feel will be lasting.  I've tried to be helpful by sharing things that have worked for me, or things that caught me off guard and might be of benefit for others to watch out for. Going forward though, I would like to maybe be a TA for Try Turing events and perhaps act as a mentor.  I also wish I had more interaction with my own mentor.
