# Tyler Lundgren - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* In this module I would really just like to learn how to start to implement web applications.  My goal is to learn how to implement content changes to the web page as well as work on some front end design.  I know that I don't specifically enjoy working with html, and CSS so this is an indicator that I need to exert more effort on getting better with these technologies.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* In truth I struggled most with the CSS static challenges. On the back end side, at first it was just all the domain specific language. Over time though, and through muscle memory I became much more comfortable with it.  The thing that I have identified for myself to work more on going forward is SQL and SQL joins or ActiveRecord joins (not through relationships but the methods themselves.

## Blog
[Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@nergdnvlt/a-journey-into-the-world-of-tech-blockchain-a35372b938ed)<br>
I wrote on bitcoin - specifically the block itself. I think my desired trajectory is something in financial/economic tech/blockchain consultancy or eventually machine learning/AI - esp with regard to the financial/economic tech sector.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- I really enjoyed idea-box.  I didn't so much understand the minimum viable product, per se; but the process of working through the entire project on my own was enjoyable. With the group projects often, you don't get to touch all aspects of a project (which will be more true to actual work - but for learning purposes it's important to touch everything).
- Least favorite was absolutely Little Shop. I just don't think it really has much practical value in terms of the overall learning goals for the mod. I understand it's a lightweight framework, but it's just clunky. I think it makes much more sense to relegate Sinatra to pre-work to give an overall understanding of MVC if required, but it makes more sense to just focus on Rails during the mod.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I really like that (as said above) that the independent project really forced you to work through everything, to touch everything.  For my own learning, that specific strategy is really important to my overall learning process. As stated through the mod, I think a better strategy might be less projects (or reduced scope on projects), and more muscle memory building exercises. Esp when it comes to namespacing/auth/sessions/carts.


What did you learn from your paired projects?
- I learned that it is ok (not for learning, but for completion) that it is ok not to have to read/touch every line of code. You really have to trust your teammates.  I also learned that if you are struggling, it's important to reach out and communicate that to your teammates. I had one occasion where I spent a lot of time developing a feature and while I got it to work, I also had to push back working on the readme. Luckily I had communicated that to the team, and they had my back. It was a great interaction pattern and left me really appreciating the people around me in my mod. I think we've ended up with a pretty spectacular group.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
- My favorite gear up by far was the one led by Mod 4 students on mindfulness. For me, the Gear Ups related to your own personal heath and well-being are without equivocation the most valuable. I think in the daily grind at Turing we often do not take enough time for ourselves. To step back and remember that there is life outside Turing. To reset your own personal balance.
- My least favorite, again, by far was the one on group think. It seemed to offer discussion without resolution.  I think the most important thing from a session such as this is a call to action. How can we fix this?  In this particular respect, I don't think the Gear Up was very productive. I also think that a forced group discussion on GroupThink in a Gear Up session is a little bit of GroupThink in and of itself - it would be much better, in my mind as a reading/reflection format.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I contributed through an increased mentoring role.  I tried to be active in conversations on our pairing challenge with the current Mod 1. I participated in the mock evals we conducted for the people who wanted them in Mod 1. And I'm also acting as a backend TA for Try-Turing this coming weekend. On the non-mentoring side, I just try to focus on being a good partner/teammate/classmate - to hopefully give more than I take.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I would like to participate more as a TA. I would like to get more involved in the overall development community as well. To start attending conferences, writing blogs, networking.
