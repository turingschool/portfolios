### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I feel like my biggest achievement in the mod is my progress with Django/Python. I have really come to appreciate the language. However, I do not know if I like it as much as Ruby/Rails.  And as such, I think it has cemented my language preferences in the upcoming job hunt. It makes me much more comfortable with targeting specific jobs going forward.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Javascript, and in particular asynchronous functions/call backs/promises provided the most struggle. I think a lot of it came from the fact I don't know best practices and that also I don't feel like always need an asynchronous function when Node.js requires it. What I've learned most strongly from this is my dedication to craftsmanship. I want to approach it as a craft, to continually improve little by little. Iterating on my own skills and as such I want to write solid, elegant code - not just cobble things together.

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I think it's my approach that really sets me apart - that I do approach programming as a craft. And something that I want to practice to continue to get better.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

It very strongly influenced what I want to do after Turing. Even in Mods 2 and 3, I knew that I did not enjoy CSS and HTML. Then adding JavaScript and JQuery to that just made it even less attractive. I view this as positive information though - I know without any doubt that I do not want a career in full stack or on the front end. That I will actively avoid positions that are full stack  or front end. It has also reframed the direction that I want to take my career - I would like to get into more logic based programming and CS theory - especially as related to machine learning, backend technologies, etc.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

The most important skill I will take with me is the ability to take on challenges that I don't feel comfortable with. I like to know that I can solve a problem before I take it on. However because there is so much out there, and that the field itself is so large, you can't know everything. And I have found it really enjoyable to dive into a problem that I've never encountered, break it into smaller chunks and then work on solving it piece by piece, that sense of a growth mindset. That to me, is the most important thing I go forward with.
