# Andrew Piermarini - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**
In Module 2, I set out to increase my understanding of object-oriented programming with Ruby, as well as to develop a solid foundation in the fundamentals of web application development with a focus in Rails. This included gaining an understanding of and proficiency in the HTTP request/response cycle, the MVC architecture, RESTful routing, database design, SQL, ActiveRecord, HTML/CSS and other front-end styling tools. I also sought to hone my testing skills using RSPEC and Capybara, and to explore the use of authentication, authorization, sessions and cart implementation. Moreover, Module 2 served as an opportunity for me to continue build my algorithmic thinking skills and to practice proper syntax and style.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**
I struggled most with managing my work/life balance this module. I'm not sure that I learned much from this struggle.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**
My favorite projects this module were Rails Mini and Bike Share. I enjoyed Rails Mini because I had creative control over the application and was able to exercise my knowledge in all aspects of project development, as well become better-acquainted with auth. I liked Bike Share because of the ActiveRecord queries, cart implementation and broader use of sessions.

In hindsight, if I had to choose one, I would say my least favorite project was Little Shop. I think it may have been more valuable to have gotten additional experience in Rails and to have introduced cart implementation in Rails Mini.

**What did you learn from your independent projects?**
From Rails Mini, I learned how to design a project and to take it from concept to production entirely by myself. It challenged me to consider more closely the impact of my design decisions, their impact on user experience, and allowed me to experiment with certain features as I saw fit.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?**
Paired projects provided me with the opportunity to practice Git Workflow, project management and team communication. It also gave me a better sense of what it will be like to work collaboratively on large projects and code bases.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**
My favorite Gear Up session was the student-run Mindfulness session. It was nice to speak about mindfulness, practice useful stretches, meditate, and to otherwise take a break from tech and professional development-centered material.

If I had to choose, I would say my least favorite Gear-up was group think, but I did find it to be an engaging topic.

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**
I contributed to the Turing Community by building intra- and inter-cohort connections, being supportive of my peers, and making myself available to assist those in my cohort and in Mod 1 as much as possible.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**
Next module, I would like to be more proactive in pairing. I was very passive in my approach this module and did not pair with Module 1 students nearly as much as I thought I would leading into Module 2. I would also like to try to join in on posses and lunch and learns on occasion.
