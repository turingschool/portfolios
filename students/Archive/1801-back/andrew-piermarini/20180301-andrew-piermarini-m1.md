# Andrew Piermarini - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Module 1, I set out to build a solid foundation in object-oriented programming with Ruby, as well as to gain an understanding of the development environment and development tools. I also sought to learn the basics of test-driven development and to more generally gain experience building out projects to specs. Moreover, Module 1 served as an opportunity to hone my algorithmic thinking skills and to practice proper Ruby syntax and style.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work and projects for Module 1 were as follows:

#### Perilous Journey

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/agpiermarini/perilous-journey)
* [Original Assignment] (http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/perilous_journey)

Perilous Journey was the first individual project of Module 1. The assignment was to build a wagon train (a la Oregon Trail) using a linked list data structure. The expectation was that our program could append, prepend, insert and remove nodes, while maintaining an ability to search for key information such as surname, or add supplies. It was also our introduction to test-driven development.

Evaluation Comments:
* 3 node tests, 3 failing, 31 linked_list_tests, 10 wagon_train_tests
* Some very long methods
* Be consistent with == nil and .nil, pick one and stick to it
* Only make things attr_reader and attr_accessor when necessary, no other times

Evaluation Scores:
* Ruby Syntax and Style: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/agpiermarini/http-yeah-you-know-me)
* [Original Assignment] (http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me)

HTTP Yeah You Know Me was the second individual project of Module 1. The assignment was to build an HTTP server that could handle a basic request and response cycle. Included functionality was a number guessing game, a word search mechanism and various redirects.

Evaluation Comments:
* Got through all iterations
* Talked about logic living in particular places that might want to be adjusted
* Talked about instance variables and how many is too many
* Overall, nice test coverage and SRP

Evaluation Scores:
* Ruby Syntax and Style: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Version Control: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

Group work and projects for Module 1 were as follows:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/agpiermarini/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Enigma was the first paired project of Module 1. The assignment was to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking text messages, all while supporting text file input, output, reading and writing.

Evaluation Comments:
* Crack printed out array of all keys (proper functionality required "..end.." to be in original message)
* 42 tests, all passing.
* Some violations of DRY in the code, opportunities to refactor present

Evaluation Scores:
* Ruby Syntax and Style: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Git Workflow: 3
* Functionality: 3

Partner Feedback:
Andrew, I really enjoyed working on this project with you.  I think we got a strong start and even though there were hiccups during the eval with Mike, I blame it on the vagueness of the spec, especially since a few other groups were under the same impressions as we were. One area where I think we both can improve on is the Git workflow. It’s taken me a little while to practice committing at a standard frequency, and that’s something I think would be a good habit for you to get into. I’m still a little shaky with Git, so I’m sorry if I wasn’t modeling the best practice, and it was evident that we both need to do a better job with the merge notes per the evaluation. I also appreciate all the long hours and hard work you put in to get the project done. I felt it was a success. Good Job, and great working with you!

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pollockcl/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Black Thursday was the second paired project and final project of Module 1. Groups were tasked with creating a business engine that stored customers, merchants, invoices, invoice items and transactions in respective repositories, and a sales analyst that could carry out business analytics. This project also served as an introduction to testing with fixture datasets.

## D: Professional Skills

Module 1 Professional Development topics were as follows:

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset is believing you can improve with effort and determination; that is, one's abilities, talents, etc. are not fixed traits. This session served to reinforce my perspective on learning, particularly the belief that new skills can be developed and that failure does not indicate an inability to perform a specific task, but rather highlights areas in which one should strive to improve. Similarly, one should embrace feedback and criticism. It is in this spirit that I have chosen to approach my time at Turing.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Reduce cognitive leaks wherever possible. Sierra and Coate’s material speaks to the learning process as it relates to Turing. It suggests that, when an individual attempts master too much at once, they are draining critical cognitive resources and are less likely to progress in understanding (e.g. never mastering those skills, or mastering some portion of them but in a way that is half-baked and does not support further learning). While I at times find myself pondering the universe of what I do not know in Ruby/Object-Oriented-Program, I am taking strides approach unfamiliar topics/skills by breaking them into smaller components. This can range from spending more time on exercises (katas) to simply being mindful that chipping away at a large problem is always a more effective use of time than fretting about the overall scope of the task.

#### Introvert, Extrovert and Ambivert Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

There is a common misconception that an introvert is someone who is shy, and that an extrovert is someone who is outgoing and, furthermore, that individuals are either one or the other. The reality is that the concepts surrounding introversion and extroversion relate more to the manner in which we "recharge" as individuals--whether in the presence of others, or in spending time alone. Furthermore, the two exist on a spectrum on which the vast majority of individuals fall somewhere in between the polar ends. This view has encouraged me to better understand where I and others fall on the spectrum and how it impacts working styles.

#### Managing Stress

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

There are different types of anxiety/stress. Stress is a fact of life, but understanding the types and triggers is critical to managing overall stress levels and keeping within a healthy window of ups and downs. This session has encouraged me to be mindful of what types of stress I encounter regularly and what I might do to anticipate those stressors so that I can practice healthy coping mechanisms and avoid burnout.

#### Personal Story

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

A critical component of forming a developer identity is being able to communicate your personal story. A personal story includes, among other things, how one got to where they are, the values they hold dear, the lenses through which they view the world, and how all of this impacts their goals and trajectory--where they want to be and what they want to accomplish in the future. This session drove home the importance of being able to put all of this in narrative form for when it comes time to look for jobs, as doing so will help me and prospective employers to determine where there exists a good fit.

#### (Ethics in AI)

* No URL

AI is increasingly a part of society and everyday life. As developers, we must consider the ethical and cultural implications of technological advancement in this space and go beyond the mere question of "can we build it?" to ask "_should_ we build it?," and "_how_ should we build it in a way that respects individual privacy, human dignity, etc." As I continue down the path of becoming a career developer, I will be mindful of the intersection of technology and the humanities and pause to have these conversations and consider these topics.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I contributed to the Turing Community by building intra- and inter-cohort connections, being supportive of my peers, and making myself available to assist those in my cohort as much as possible.
