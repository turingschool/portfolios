## Areas of Emphasis

* What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  - This module, I set out to not only gain an understanding of Rails, but also how to build database driven applications in general. I feel this was incredibly successful, considering that now I actually can build out a complex relational database structure and effectively traverse it using ActiveRecord.

* What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  - Effectively working in groups. Despite group members saying the contrary, I do feel like I am not pulling my weight as much as I could be. This is as easy to combat as really buckling down and working when I say I'm going to work. Taking on more than I usually would when we are dividing things up, and working to collaborate with my team members on the task at hand. Both in separate branches, or as two people at the same computer.

## Projects

* What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
   - I loved bike share. Getting the experience working in a team environment (more than just a 2 person project) was great. And the scale of the project, though large, was incredibly useful in discovering how to build out larger database driven applications that need many parts to work together.
   - Least favorite? I wouldn't say I particularly hated any project, but job tracker wasn't fantastic. Not necessarily because of the project itself or the partner I was with as a person, but it is difficult to collaborate with someone who either doesn't follow convention, or gets a bit ahead of where you're ready to be at that point. Although, I can tend to do that myself so it is nice to see it from the other perspective.

* What did you learn from your independent projects?
  - I loved the rails mini project! And I really learned how important it is to thoroughly test a product from every angle (both in specs and on a development build!) so that when it comes time to present, it actually works. That's something I could have focused on a lot more. As well, being able to effectively build database relationships to make applications open for extension in the future.

* What did you learn from your paired projects?
  - How to effectively communicate with a team, especially when you have a weird sleep/work schedule. I tend to get work done ludicrously late, so I do have to work around the rest of my team members to be able to make sure that I am getting them what they need to do their stuff.

## Community

* What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  - I loved the feedback sessions, as well as the ones about creating your story. Having a story that is unique, exciting, and interesting is so important so I LOVE the fact that there's an emphasis at Turing on working on our story as a developer and individual.

* How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  - Pairing with mod 1 students! I loved helping them tackle problems, both ones I have seen as well as new ones to me! Great to work with my friends that repeated, and make new ones.

* What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  - Even more pairing with lower mods! I loved helping when I did. I need to do more of it.
