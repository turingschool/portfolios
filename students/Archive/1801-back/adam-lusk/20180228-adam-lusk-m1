Notes: decrypt.rb file io not working, Enigma.encrypt not working in pry, ^working in tests, Only Enigma class, Tests error out in Rake, Tested different lengths of messages, nil, tested upper case, Lots of helper methods. Could have factored out into other classes

Here is my feedback from Rob:  

Working with you was a real pleasure. Our personalities, communications, and interactions went so smoothly.
Your knowledge of coding, and your ability to figure out what was needed in a given situation was fantastic.
When you find your partner is lost, it may be beneficial to see if they would like to spend time going over what they do not understand, thus giving the opportunity for mutual learning. I may have coded the key creation, but you figured out the files, encryption, and decryption. Would be happy to collaborate with you again, great job!
Rememberâ€¦YOU CAN DO IT!!!  

Black Thursday   
https://github.com/anon0mys/black_thursday  
Build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries  
against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

D: Professional Skills  
Summaries of what I took away from each Gear Up session  

Growth Mindset   
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown   
Much of the material here I've learned from being a musician. I'm never too down on myself for what I do or  
don't know, or my skill level of anything at any given time. I'm well aware that people change.  

Getting Better at Difficult Things  
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md   
I learned that cognitive resources are finite and have to be watched to be used best. I continue to categorize  
my skill sets into the three categories defined in the video. I especially find useful the skill of breaking up a  
task that is possible with effort into many pieces to move that skill into the can do with no effort category.  

Working Styles  
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown  
Nothing in this session was surprising to learn about myself. I learned a lot of intersting in ways which people  
perceive themselves. Even ambiverts have their quirks and pet peeves. It is best just to stay open minded to many   
different working styles and be willing to work outside of your comfort zone.  

Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms   
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md   
Being healthy is different for everybody, and I learned that I shouldn't feel guilty for doing  
the things that keep me healthy, like being alone for periods and going for long walks. In my own experience,  
my health doesn't improve if I focus on it. Accomplishing things and moving forward makes me feel good, so if  
I focus on the solution to a problem or can say definitively that I've learned a new concept, then I naturally  
gravitate towards healthier habits.

Community Gear Up: Mod 4 Leads From Introvert to Influential  
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_5.md  
There are many ways you can fake confidence until you have actually have it. One way I always forget is that  
by just having confident body language, you can trick others into thinking you have it. This also tricks your  
own body: changing your posture can also change your cortisol and testosterone levels.  

E: Community Participation Playing a Part  
I'm still too much of a noob to help others right now, but I do much bragging about the school. Many people  
have never heard of it.  I have been decently social and I ask others what they're working on in other mods.
