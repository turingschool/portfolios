## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  1) Build a stronger mentor/mentee network.<br>
  I made strong connections with other women developers at a weekend LadyCoders conference during this mod.  I also met two new mentors at the conference and have had a couple of informal meetings with both of them since the conference.  I feel lik I was successful in this area.
  2) Become more comfortable clearly articulating technical ideas and my personal story.<br>
  This is something that I continue to struggle with, but I have made progress this mod.  I have tried to take the time to clearly organize what I want to say internally before I express it verbally.
  3) Revisit Mod 1 projects in order to keep my Ruby skills strong.<br>
  Sadly, I didn't have time to do this.
  4) Feel confident with web development frameworks and testing.<br>
  I feel that I was ultimately successful in this area.  I struggled in the middle of the mod and then actively sought-out additional resources to help me better understand some of the pieces I was struggling to "get" - mostly ActiveRecord queries and nesting vs namespacing.
  5) Build a personal website for alternative process photography.<br>
  Sadly, I did not have time to do this.
  
What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?<br>
This module, I really struggled with memorizing some of the material and consistently recalling information without relying on examples and projects.  I learned through that struggle that I have to be more proactive about seeking out resources online that are consistent with my visual learning style.  I also learned that I needed more repetitive practice than what was being assigned to me and I needed to make time to focus solely on exercises instead of projects all the time.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?<br>
I really enjoyed working on the Little Shop project because it was the first time I was exposed to the power of a web framework.  I also gained most of my styling knowledge from that project which helped me throughout the mod.  My least favorite project was PointsBox/RailsMini because it didn't involve a large dataset and seemed less appealing to me after it was finished.

What did you learn from your independent projects?<br>
From PointsBox, I learned the basics of authentication and authorization.  It also helped to solidify Rails convention around routing, route helpers and form helpers.  I also learned that I prefer to collaborate with team mates on projects rather than work on a project entirely on my own with little feedback from others.

What did you learn from your paired projects?<br>
From Little Shop, I learned the basics of MVC web app structure and HTML/CSS.  I also learned more about my personal working style for group projects, which made it easier to describe my working style to future team mates during the rest of the mod.  From Job Tracker, I learned how to perform basic Active Record queries on a database and began to learn RAILS conventions.  Finally, from Bike Share, I learned how to seed a database from large CSV files and was apply to practice applying many types of associations between objects.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?<br>
My favorite Gear Up was the session on Empathy and Priviledge because I was able to engage in rich, thought-provoking conversation with my peers and the articles that we read in that session were very well-written.  My least favorite Gear Up was the session on Group Think because I didn't have any strong take-aways from that session.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?<br>
I volunteered to be a TA for a Try Turing weekend class and to join the student panel for that event.  It was nice to engage with potential new students and the other TAs that weekend.  I also continued to attend Joan Clarke meetings and to develop relationships within that group.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?<br>
I would like to be more intentional about reaching out to lower and upper mod students for pairing sessions.  I would also like to be more present at Turing in general so I can feel closer to the community.
