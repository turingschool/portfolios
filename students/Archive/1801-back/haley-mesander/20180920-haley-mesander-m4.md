## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I think that I performed strongly throughout all iterations of Quantified Self.  I was able to parse through documentation well enough to create functional APIs in both Node/Express and Django.  The process of working through Quantified Self has given me confidence that I can build off off my foundational knowledge of Rails and venture successfully into unknown tech stacks.  I challenged myself to deploy the Rails Quantified Self to AWS Elastic Beanstalk without using Heroku, which was a struggle but I gained a much deeper appreciation of the challenges of DevOps.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Technically, I struggled the most with trying to build upon an existing React codebase during our capstone project.  I felt largely unprepared because my knowledge of Javascript is limited and it was difficult to draw connections between Rails and React (as I did in Quantified Self).  I learned through that struggle that I need to pair more and be less afraid to ask questions about an unfamiliar technology.  I also did learn enough about the structure of the React app to be able to contribute code to the project in the end.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I've been working as an intern with Nanno, a startup on-demand childcare services app, on the side when I haven't been engrossed in Mod4 projects.  It has been a humbling experience to work on such a large Rails codebase that is deployed in production with currently about 4,000 users.  While attempting to build a feature, I learned about Trail Blazer, which is a high-level architecture that Nanno uses.  It took me three weeks, but I was finally able to make a commit to the project that is now deployed!

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Working with Javascript and React has confirmed that I strongly prefer to work with backend technologies.  However, I feel that I could contribute code to JS and React projects if my job required it.  Also, after working with a front-end developer on the capstone project, I have a much better understanding of the level of documentation that I need to provide as a back-end developer to make my API easily accessible to other developers.  Mod4 has continued to expand my understanding of the work of a software developer by introducing many new technologies.  I have a much better idea of how a company can gain business value by leveraging many different technologies that work together to create a product.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Always aim to be humble and to approach problems with curiosity rather than fear.  Turing has introduced me to the enormous world of software engineering, where extraordinary people around the world are daily developing life-changing products.  My Mod1 reaction to the quantity of content out there to learn was to doubt my intelligence and feel intimidated by everything I did not know.  However, Turing has painstakingly broken me of that mentality and now I am much less afraid to admit when I don't know something. I also have transitioned to being less intimidated by the new and unfamiliar.
