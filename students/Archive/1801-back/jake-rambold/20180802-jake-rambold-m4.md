## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Taking the time to further explore django interactions. Previously I had only used it as a backend api as it was easy to quickly create and deploy basic endpoints with any needed logic. Building out templates and multiple relationship models for a game night planning app really emphasized how files are structured, how they are meant to function together, and the quirks that make it easier and straightforward for some functions, slightly more complicated for others.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
I think my biggest struggle was probably the javascript assessment. Some of the peculiarities of the language and the way it handles execution is not as readily apparent as other languages. Mix that with a time crunch to build something makes the focus on getting it working over figuring out the best way to get it working. I probably came away with a better knowledge of javascript as well as a the priority focus to get the code running.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
With some of the focus back on coding challenges involving datastructures, bigO, and algorithms, I've been able to step back into an area I feel more confident in. Being able to identify the correct structure to use to neatly and quickly implement a solution to a problem allowed my to relearn some old material as well as try and help others understand it.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I think it mostly reinforced why I chose the backend program. It's still somewhat mystifying that someone would want take a language like javascript and want to convert it into a whole backend server with node. I think it's definitely helpful to have the layout abilities as well as the increased functionality that jquery allows. There's things simply not possible on the backend alone without the interactivity. Just if I could place myself on the spectrum of designer all the way to dba I lean far toward the backend side.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
I think it would have to be how to jump in and explore different frameworks. I feel like I came in with an understanding of the logic of code and how it functions, but turing emphasized more of standards and practices of why you would structure a program in a certain manner. It definitely shifted some of the focus for me away from the "it works and works efficiently" more toward "it's structured so the next person can understand and maintain it"
