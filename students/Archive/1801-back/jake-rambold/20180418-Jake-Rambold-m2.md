## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Learn more about databases and rails. On one hand I feel like I learned a ton about rails as well as active record with a refresher on what I already knew of sequel. I feel like I learned a lot, but at the same time skimmed the surface of so many topics it would be helpful to dive into more.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

There was a lot to memorize that isn't necessarily logical, but more shortcuts that get impressed through doing them repeatedly. Finding time to sit down and do the repetition to ingrain it into memory was a lot more helpful than trying to remember a logic of why it was done.

## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).

Looks into the consumer paid cost of giving up their data, how the data is used, and what kind of effect it has in the political realm.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Rails mini was my as it gave more freedom for what you wanted to build and to build something useful in addition to learning

Little shop as was the least favorite as it built on black friday and used sinatra rather than rails

What did you learn from your independent projects?

Quite a bit about ruby date objects and forms.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned a lot about how to divide up the work on a project and organize workflow so that everyone knows what's going on and what to work on.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

Favorite: Group Think - it had a variety of ideas on how to talk and debate to hear multiple sides

Least Favorite: Empathy and Privilege - There's so much nuance, social preferences, and policy very much of which is controversial that this is impossible to discuss at detailed level of understanding in a short period of time.
