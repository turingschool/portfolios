## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
In this module I set out to get a deep enough knowledge of rails that I could build something entirely on my own. I feel like I was successful in that I started working a personal project and have a good sense on the next steps I need to take.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
In this module I would say I struggled most with the stuff outside of the coding itself like the lightning talks and gear ups. I feel pretty confident in my public speaking ability and other extracurricular stuff but wish I could spend more energy focused on the technical side of things. I do understand that those things are important however.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project in the module was definitely the rails mini project as I had a bit more creative freedom to work on my own thing and drive the direction. There weren't any projects that I really disliked, but my least favorite project was likely Job Tracker for a few reasons. The first being that I was excited to use rails but I still didn't feel like I was capable of building anything of significance with it. The second being that my partner ended up having some life stuff happen during the project so I felt like I had to do an unfair portion of the project.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I would say the thing I learned most was being able to determine the direction to take a project without having pre-written user stories to go by.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned lots of things, but the thing I learned most was using git with more than just myself on big projects.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite Gear Up was the mindfulness class led by mod 4. It was relaxing and great to spend some time stretching and meditating. My least favorite Gear Up was the one title Empathy & Privilege. It felt like the whole class was about privilege and there was no focus on empathy. The teacher also spent time listening in on each groups personal conversations which felt *very* uncomfortable

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I contributed to the Turing community this module by helping mod 1 students with any questions they had about ruby.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Now that I'm confident in rails and am more confident in the learning process, next module I'd like to be more involved in school wide things like the code fair and code challenges.
