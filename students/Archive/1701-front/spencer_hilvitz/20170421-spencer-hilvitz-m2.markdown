## A: End of Module Assessment

In this mod I wanted to get a better understanding of JavaScript and objects. I didn't feel like I had a very good understanding of objects or Mythical Creatures type classes coming into the mod and I feel much better about objects, arrays and array prototypes now.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Game-Time

*   [GitHub URL] https://github.com/letakeane/lk-sh-gametime
*   [Original Assignment]            http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

##### Comments

For our Game-Time project we were required to create a game of our choice. Leta and I chose Snake. This project helped us to get a better understanding of classes and the HTML canvas. Snake ended up being more complicated than we thought because of the logic required to move the segments of the snake and because of the way that the animation on the canvas worked.

### Evaluation Results

Functional Expectations

3.5 Snake game is fully playable and speeds up when you eat more apples

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. instructions, new game, high scores...
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### Sorting-Sweet

*   [GitHub URL] https://github.com/hilvitzs/sorting-suite
*   [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html

#### Comments

In Sorting-Sweet we were required to write sorting algorithms. We needed to write one a Bubble Sort, an Insertion Sort, and a Merge Sort. We needed to see the efficiency of each sort type and make use of recursion.

#### Evaluation Rubric

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2. Test-Driven Development

#### Complete-Me

*   [GitHub URL] https://github.com/hilvitzs/complete-me
*   [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html


##### Comments

For the Complete-Me project, we needed to learn and understand the idea of tries. We needed to create an auto-complete trie that would suggest words from the dictionary when you typed in the first couple letters of a word. We were also required to put the most selected word in the front of the suggestions array.

#### Eval Results

1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Weathrly

*   [GitHub URL] https://github.com/hilvitzs/weatherly
*   [Original Assignment] http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

##### Comments

In the Weatherly project we needed to make use of an API and API key in order to get updated weather information. We also needed to use React, which means using components and passing props from one component to another. We needed to responsively style the page using CSS. This was a project that combined everything from the whole mod, including manipulating object and arrays.

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

// Weathrly -- make sure TenDay, Hourly, and Input are rendering // TenDay -- Pass in data, make sure ten DayItems are rendering // Hourly -- Pass in data, make sure there are seven .hourlyForecast cards rendered // Current -- Pass in data, make sure correct hi and low values are rendered

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

## C: Feedback and Community Participation

From Keji: "Working with you was very enjoyable. You are good at communicating and making sure that both parties are on the same page. I also appreciated your laid back attitude."

Giving Feedback for Leta: "Leta was a great project partner. I was really struggling with some of the major concepts in Game-Time and Leta was patient and very helpful. I would definitely not have been able to finish the project without her patience and guidance. The only suggestion that I have for her is explaining what she's working on as she does it, which we discussed in one of our feedback sessions. Thanks for being such a great project partner!"

From Leta: "I always love working with Spencer. He's diligent and persistent, and it was fun to work together. At the moments when I was banging my head against the wall, he provided 1) commiseration, and 2) determination to solve the problems. I think we both felt out of our depth with GameTime, but it was good because Spencer was there - dependable and sympathetic. I always enjoy working on projects with Spencer!"


### Playing a Part

I participated in group white-boarding sessions for the more difficult projects, including Complete-Me and Sorting-Sweet. I participated in Gear Up and Retro's and enjoyed Gear Up sessions especially the Automation Gear Up.


### Self-Assessment

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


I feel that with each project increasing in difficulty, I have achieved grades of three's starting from the beginning and progressed toward 3.5's towards the end of the mod. I feel that I have increased my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript, CSS and HTML. While still having a lot of room for improvement, I feel that I have generally continued to do better on each project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

I feel that I have gotten along well with every project partner that I have had. I also like to think that I have helped my partners understand new concepts, while not being too shy to ask for help in understanding things that they have mastered. I have never had an argument or felt like there was frustration toward me or toward my communication through any of the projects.

## D: Professional Development

3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

I have been active and involved in professional development courses. More importantly, I feel that I have actively used skills and concepts discussed in professional development, including pairing suggestions and updating information on all of my professional accounts.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond supports of the community.

I was excited and grateful to be able to lead a Sprite Spike with Leta toward the end of Mod 1. This gave me an opportunity to better teach myself a topic that had not been entirely taught in class and to ensure that I understood it enough to demonstrate to the class. I also did some organization of our Mod to discuss any frustrations that we were having in order to find some actionable steps towards the betterment of our experience.
