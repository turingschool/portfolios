# Areas of Emphasis
-	In this mod I wanted to better understand fetches and back end processes. I also wanted to get a better handle on everything we've learned in the past couple of mods. I was really happy to get to use things like Object.assign, Promises, and get reacquanited with vanilla Javascript and jQuery, and in our capstone project to use React as well. I feel like this mod did a really good job of bringing everything that we've learned together.

# Community
- Resilience Gear Up
	- I really enjoyed leading a Gear Up session. Getting the opportunity to dive into topics that we may have touched on before was really enjoyable. I think that Resiliency is a really important trait and it's one that everyone in the Turing community and the world at large can benefit from and understand better. Getting to work with Back End students that I haven't had the opportunity to work with before was a great change and the feedback from our session was generally pretty positive. I also think it's helpful for lowers mods to see upper mods leading sessions and taking on a more leadership role since it's easy to get caught up in the immense amount of work that we have to do and not participate in the community.
