CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

## Professional Development:
Date of feedback conversation: 3/22/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? Reflected on the past project and considered where both parties were coming from in each instance

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? The conversation went well for me, it was easy to talk about a project that has been run recently but it turns out it didn't really accomplish anything as the anonymous adjective' feedback I received from the partner I originally spoke with was very different then this feedback conversation

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? I used the appreciation principle of feedback in my conversation, trying to show how grateful I was to take on that project with that person and learn those challenging things together. I thought it went well but as I said I don't think the adjective feedback with fitting

Transferable Skills: As a musician I had to become good at pattern recognition and that has been very helpful in programing. Programming skills transfer IRL to being able to critically and logically think about situations and approaches to everyday on-takings.

Favorite/Most Valued Knowledge: Logic

Favorite working conditions: Working as a group or the total opposite and working remotely

Values/Goals/Mission in life: Enjoy my job and have a second home in Costa Rica

Preferred places to live: West of Denver or anywhere there is mtns and lots of trees

Preferred salary and level of responsibility: I would like to be making 70k and working as a junior dev remotely

The mentor (and alum) I contacted is Adam Jensen

Date of contact 03/31/2017 He responded and we have been chatting over slack since as he mentors me. He has given me a lot of insight about the community and how his journey has gone since leaving school as well as mentoring me on different code challenges I have come up against.

## Community:

Link to reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):
This module I tried to use as many agile practices that were suitable, I often ask for feedback and usability then try to implement those change and then ask again for more feedback. I also often like to set a sprint in less time then the project because it almost always takes longer. I also aim for half rather then half-assed if it comes down to that choice and always add features last and functionality first

Link to feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams using these guidelines
What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? I really enjoy receiving different ideas and explanations from students rather then instructors if something is confusing because if I am confused from the way something is explained then the student who does understand it can probably see where I am coming from.

How do you use your strengths as a team member? I like to work together, side by side through the most difficult programing and save the time consuming css to work on after hours making both members strong when it comes to difficult concepts. I also like to explain concepts that I understand and am patient when doing so and I think that helps make me a stronger team player.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? I would like to continue to develop a greater grasp over concepts and practices as well as become more fluent with vocabulary so communication is clearer.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate? Become better at speaking my mind when I have an idea and develop a grasp of what should be done to make something work properly

How would you like your teammates to see you? A helpful and supportive team member that has a solid understanding but can still learn a lot from other members ideas

### Feedback: Self-solicited and project pairs feedback, plus a summary of how you've contributed to the community

#### Dave Hubertus - Paired on CloudKicker - React Weather App
Adam and I have had very successful paired programming partnerships or PPPs as I like to call it. Adam has very strong and effective communication abilities, which makes working as a group effortless. He has a strong understanding of the subject matter and can guide a group project in an uncomplicated manner. The environment Adam creates makes it easy to bounce ideas off each other, which eventually leads to breakthroughs. Also guys just a savage.

#### Adam Jensen - Mentor:
I’ve been pairing with Adam for about one month. Adam has shown some excellent traits during this time:

  1. Adam and I typically communicate via slack. He has shown the ability to problem solve and multitask asynchronously. This has been very accommodating to my schedule and we are able to remain productive even during work hours. I cannot iterate enough: his communication habits are above average and this makes a BIG difference. In short, Adam makes it easier to pair(which is why we chat so often).
  2. He is receptive to feedback in the best way possible. He accepts code/technical critiques as well as pairing concerns.
  3. Has impressed me with his ability to understand new concepts quickly. I have thrown some pretty interesting code snippets at him. Things like small optimizations/alternative solutions…etc. And he usually grasps them very quickly. He is also curious enough to ask questions further his understanding.

I'm optimistic that Adam will become a strong programmer. I’ve been impressed with the points above. Although we don’t usually get the time to pair program through entire problems, I always appreciate the insight he brings to our conversations.

#### Contributions to the Turing community:
I have opened up at least one hour a day to pair with mod1 on problems and projects, I only had a couple students take me up on this time but it was always successful and productive. I have also really enjoyed taking part in the IronFE groups a few times a week, this has really strengthened my understanding and has given me an opportunity to see how more advanced programs/students take on difficult problems.
