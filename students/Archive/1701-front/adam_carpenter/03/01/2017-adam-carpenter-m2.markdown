# Adam Carpenter - Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering

This module I set out to improve my knowledge, skills and ability in html formatting and layout, css styling's and organization and all things javascript. When I entered this program I knew very little about the inner-workings, testing and functionality of JS and it was very interesting adventure to learn all that a developer could do with JS. Within the first couple weeks I also learned a huge amount about how to quickly use terminal to navigate as well as increase my working knowledge and workflow on github

#### Javascript Testing Assessment

Evaluator: Bree

Progression/Completion

* Although we did not make it very far, you handled the hiccups very well
* You still need practice in working in small incremental steps and testing your assumptions along the way
* Good job taking direction and more carefully reading the feedback from the tests
* I think you grasp the concepts of the data structures, you just need more time working with them
* You need to work on communicating with the proper terminology

#### Static Comp CSS Challenge Assessment

Evaluator: Bree

Progression/Completion
* Need to cross browswer test on safari
* Need to fix issues w/ flexbox on FireFox
* Revisit class names in markup - don't wan't to use tag names as extra adjectives in the class name ("circle-graphs-div" should be "circle-graphs"
* Refactor to remove some div tags - get more semantic, example, use `<fieldset>` in your forms to mark division of form content
* Work on the organization of your css re: idomatic & in-line/order with the markup and chunking out sections of the css( base, scaffolding, typography, etc)
* Very solid job overall
 
### Design Integrity

- 3: The comp accurately reflects the design integrity with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements. While there are areas of improvement, it is a close representation of the original design.

### Responsive Layout

- 3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 or can set their own range. The app randomly selects a number and will return 'Too high' 'Too low' or 'Boom' until the user guesses correctly.

Evaluator comments (Bree):
  Should use convention CSS class naming with lower case, not js format
  Consider using id's for all your JS hooks, it's faster
  Some repeated CSS with font-family declarations
  Refactor media queries to take out redundant properties

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Groups of two building app to specs set by evaluators.


#### Linked List

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/LinkedList)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project was to create an app for the user to build a list with. Stats as follows:
  One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
  A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
    The title of the bookmark
    The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
  A button to “Mark as Read”
  A button to “Remove” the bookmark
  
The user should be able to input a title and URL into the appropriate fields. 
When the user clicks on the button for creating the bookmark, it should be added to the bookmarks section.
When the user clicks on the “Mark as Read” button:
  A class of .read should be added to the bookmark
  If it already has the class of .read, it should be removed
When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the link should be removed from the page
If the user omits the title or the URL, the application should not create the link and should instead display an error prompt.
The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile.
The button for creating links should be disabled if there are no contents in the title or URL fields.
The application should be able to keep count of the total number of links currently on the page.
The application should be able to keep count of the total number of read and unread links currently on the page.

##### Evaluator Comments (Louisa): 
Small design errors in spacing in body, more cohesive color scheme would be nice.

##### Evaluator Scores - 
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring. 

##### Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. 

##### HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors. 

##### CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Feedback from partner: 
Dave Hubertus - "Working with Adam was a great experience. We were up front about what we both wanted to get out of the experience and decided early on how we were going to attack the project. Our ideal work times were discussed and since we both wanted a hand in every aspect of our project we essentially built each part together.  Adams skill set and ability to communicate well made our first pairing very successful even when the struggle was real."


#### IdeaBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/idea-box)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project, we be built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).
Throughout the project, one of our focuses was providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we relied on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.
This is also built responsive so users can use this app on any device! 

##### Evaluator Comments (Bree): 
Some small amounts of typology repetition in CSS, JS could be broken down into smaller, more concise pieces.

##### Evaluator Scores: 
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### JavaScript Style

##### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Collaboration

3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


#### 2DoBox - Pivot

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/2DoBox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In this project we will be refactoring a fellow students IdeaBox project into a new program with beefed up option and usability. In this app we will create greater quality settings to 2Do ideas as well as employ user filter for searching through all the items on your to do list. There is a search bar, a completed button, a delete button and 5 qualities that can be assigned to each 2Do item.  All this is stored in local storage so there is no worry if you need to refresh or lose Internet connection as it will all be save until the user deletes list items.  This is also built responsive so users can use this app on any device! 

Evaluator Comments (Louisa): Better coloring of buttons, functionality was good. Break out JS even further so each function only does one job.

### Peer Feedback

#### Jack Bevis
Positive feedback -
Great person to pair with and bounce ideas off of. We didn't pair directly on any of the projects this mod, but you were always a great person to reach out to when stuck on a problem. Whether just talking about my own ideas or checking out what you had come up with, it was super helpful and crucial to the learning process. Big help on mythical creatures too. 
Areas for improvement -
Didn't bring me breakfast once. 
But in all honesty I can't speak to any specific area of improvement.  Keep it up.

#### Zane Russell
Positive feedback -
Been a good dude with a contagiously positive attitude. You've contributed hugely to an environment that encourages open communication and a sense of being a team rather than a bunch of individuals in the same room.
Areas for improvement -
More guitar

#### Karen Kepner
Positive feedback -
Adam was a great pairing partner for our in-class exercises.  We worked together to figure out the programming challenges during the lessons and were usually able to solve the problem.
Areas for improvement -
Make sure you drink lots of water, good hydration makes us smarter. (I didn't notice any areas for improvement...)

#### Charlie Dunn
Positive feedback -
Adam is sharp and picks up on things quickly. It was a pleasure pairing with him and watching him progress over the course of the module. He's clearly hungry to learn and dedicated to his craft.
Areas for improvement -
Keep striving to be vocal while you write code and talk through each step in the problem. 

#### Devon Bull
Positive feedback -
You have a chill personality and are always a pleasure to work with. 
Areas for improvement -
You might work on dialing up the intensity when coding. From what I've seen you're crushing it, and just need to trust your instincts more. 

#### Chris Jordan
Positive feedback -
Apparently from the work I have seen, you got you shtuff together. Soo keep doing whatever it is you are doing
Areas for improvement -
Honestly couldn't say. Haven't worked with you yet or seen anything I could possibly say you ought to improve on

## E Community
Turing provided sessions to help strengthen my professional side. These were a few gear up sessions that had the greatest impact on me.
### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
[Session Overview](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The idea of growth mindset was a very new to me, although I was raised in a family that valued that ideology I didn't know it was named as such. The TEDTalk video was very interesting and it made a lot of sense to me.  I think this ideology was part of the problem I had encountered at previous jobs, or lack there of this ideology. The application of growth mindset at Turing is extremely beneficial because it's such a huge on-taking to learning something like web development in a few months with many ups and downs. Practicing a growth mindset can be very difficult, but has helped in many of my approach to difficult challenges and learning curves. I try to remind myself to view each experience as a learning opportunity rather than let frustration takeover or turn it into a competition.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
[Session Overview](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This gear up had a great video by Kathy Sierra - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM - about cognative resources. The video explains that the fuel tank we use for all of our cognative resources is drained from one large tank. Everything drains these resources and is fighting for the fuel in your brain which is finite. The video goes on to explain that breaking learning difficult things, such as new coding languages or processees, down into small chunks makes it much more attainable and will get the learner to a mastery point quicker then trying to take on the problem as a whole right off the bat. This gave me a lot of insight into how I view learning new information and that it is important for me to employ this tactic to avoid from getting ovewhelmed and depleting my cognitive fuel before I master or even get a grasp of a single part of the information trying to be learned

## Professional Development:
Date of feedback conversation: 3/22/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? Reflected on the past project and considered where both parties were coming from in each instance

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? The conversation went well for me, it was easy to talk about a project that has been run recently but it turns out it didn't really accomplish anything as the anonymous adjective' feedback I received from the partner I originally spoke with was very different then this feedback conversation

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? I used the appreciation principle of feedback in my conversation, trying to show how grateful I was to take on that project with that person and learn those challenging things together. I thought it went well but as I said I don't think the adjective feedback with fitting

Transferable Skills: As a musician I had to become good at pattern recognition and that has been very helpful in programing. Programming skills transfer IRL to being able to critically and logically think about situations and approaches to everyday on-takings.

Favorite/Most Valued Knowledge: Logic

Favorite working conditions: Working as a group or the total opposite and working remotely

Values/Goals/Mission in life: Enjoy my job and have a second home in Costa Rica

Preferred places to live: West of Denver or anywhere there is mtns and lots of trees

Preferred salary and level of responsibility: I would like to be making 70k and working as a junior dev remotely

The mentor (and alum) I contacted is Adam Jensen

Date of contact 03/31/2017 He responded and we have been chatting over slack since as he mentors me. He has given me a lot of insight about the community and how his journey has gone since leaving school as well as mentoring me on different code challenges I have come up against.

## Community:

Link to reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):
This module I tried to use as many agile practices that were suitable, I often ask for feedback and usability then try to implement those change and then ask again for more feedback. I also often like to set a sprint in less time then the project because it almost always takes longer. I also aim for half rather then half-assed if it comes down to that choice and always add features last and functionality first

Link to feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams using these guidelines
What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? I really enjoy receiving different ideas and explanations from students rather then instructors if something is confusing because if I am confused from the way something is explained then the student who does understand it can probably see where I am coming from.

How do you use your strengths as a team member? I like to work together, side by side through the most difficult programing and save the time consuming css to work on after hours making both members strong when it comes to difficult concepts. I also like to explain concepts that I understand and am patient when doing so and I think that helps make me a stronger team player.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? I would like to continue to develop a greater grasp over concepts and practices as well as become more fluent with vocabulary so communication is clearer.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate? Become better at speaking my mind when I have an idea and develop a grasp of what should be done to make something work properly

How would you like your teammates to see you? A helpful and supportive team member that has a solid understanding but can still learn a lot from other members ideas

### Feedback: Self-solicited and project pairs feedback, plus a summary of how you've contributed to the community

#### Dave Hubertus - Paired on CloudKicker - React Weather App
Adam and I have had very successful paired programming partnerships or PPPs as I like to call it. Adam has very strong and effective communication abilities, which makes working as a group effortless. He has a strong understanding of the subject matter and can guide a group project in an uncomplicated manner. The environment Adam creates makes it easy to bounce ideas off each other, which eventually leads to breakthroughs. Also guys just a savage.

#### Adam Jensen - Mentor:
I’ve been pairing with Adam for about one month. Adam has shown some excellent traits during this time:

  1. Adam and I typically communicate via slack. He has shown the ability to problem solve and multitask asynchronously. This has been very accommodating to my schedule and we are able to remain productive even during work hours. I cannot iterate enough: his communication habits are above average and this makes a BIG difference. In short, Adam makes it easier to pair(which is why we chat so often).
  2. He is receptive to feedback in the best way possible. He accepts code/technical critiques as well as pairing concerns.
  3. Has impressed me with his ability to understand new concepts quickly. I have thrown some pretty interesting code snippets at him. Things like small optimizations/alternative solutions…etc. And he usually grasps them very quickly. He is also curious enough to ask questions further his understanding.

I'm optimistic that Adam will become a strong programmer. I’ve been impressed with the points above. Although we don’t usually get the time to pair program through entire problems, I always appreciate the insight he brings to our conversations.

#### Contributions to the Turing community:
I have opened up at least one hour a day to pair with mod1 on problems and projects, I only had a couple students take me up on this time but it was always successful and productive. I have also really enjoyed taking part in the IronFE groups a few times a week, this has really strengthened my understanding and has given me an opportunity to see how more advanced programs/students take on difficult problems.
