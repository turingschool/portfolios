-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge # 1 (DOM Manipulation)

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* This is a very soft pass
* You are lacking some fundamental concepts when tracking variables and understanding how a test works with your implementation code
* You will need to work on writing more code over the intermission to level up your skills for M2

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Definitely have concerns about your structural issues in the code, but I think if you take the time to refactor, you can fix it and learn a lot in the process
* Good job on the design integrity. Keep that up!
* Keep working on the html structure, it was weaker than I'd like to see, so pay attention to organization, semantics, accessiblity

### Design Integrity

- 3: The comp accurately reflects the design integrity with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements. While there are areas of improvement, it is a close representation of the original design.

### Responsive Layout

- 3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Solo Projects

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first project of the mod and it was mostly pretty fun for me. I had a small background in javascript coming in to the program and this was something I was actually somewhat familiar with so it wasn't nearly as stressful as it could have been.

I was evaluated by Bree on this challenge and got some good feedback. She recommended I look at switch statements to replace a large if else statement that I had in my code as well as look in to media queries and font cascading in CSS.

## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes:

* Check out JS switch statement for if/else function that is kind of bulky
* Revisit your mobile size media query - open it up a bit for sizes between 320 - 400. Right now, you are essentially optimizing for a 1px range.
* Revisit the font-family properties across your CSS, as it is an inherited property and you probably don't need to repeat it across your code so much.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/tg-comp-challenge-1)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This was my first attempt at coding a static site from a comp and I feel like for my first time it was fairly successful. I really embraced flex in this one got a good feel for the box model.

I didn't really receive much feedback on this one other than my hero image at the top took up a little more real estate than it should be. My layout, sizing, and color scheme were well received.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/tg-comp-challenge-2)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For my second attempt at a static site if felt that this one was significantly more challenging but in a good way. I took the time to actually sketch this one out as well a just box it out in CSS which was a super helpful way to get going on this one.

My site looked good until it hit the big screen. In the smaller widths it seemed to work well but once it was opened up it was a different story. Louisa noted that the boxes were getting too wide in the bigger widths and that a max-width would probably have been good way to go on that to fix it.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/tg-comp-challenge-3)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

For my third and final attempt at a static site I felt that I had a much harder time getting going. Its obviously a much more robust comp and I think the size of it intimidated me some. This one was NOT fun to start but once I got cruising on it I felt a lot better and in the end the design at least worked out fairly well.

Bree evaluated my third comp and this is just a copy of the comments from the full evaluation above.

* Definitely have concerns about your structural issues in the code, but I think if you take the time to refactor, you can fix it and learn a lot in the process
* Good job on the design integrity. Keep that up!
* Keep working on the html structure, it was weaker than I'd like to see, so pay attention to organization, semantics, accessiblity

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### LinkedList

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

LinkedList was our first pair project. My partner was Zane Russell. Zane and I worked well together for the most part but we really failed to do a thorough DTR befor starting which came back to bite us in the butt. This partnership ended up being a little one sided and communication needed a lot of work. After we completed the project we had a conversation about my feelings toward our dynamic and he agreed that it did become one sided so to remedy my anxiety we went back and he essentially taught me step by step what each piece of code did and explained his thought process. This part ended up being extremely helpful in getting me up to speed on jQuery.

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 2.75: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### IdeaBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/idea-box)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was our second pair project and I worked with Jack Bevis. Jack and I had a great partnership, as a matter of fact my best pairing yet. We did an informal DTR at the start of things and realized that our goals for workflow and learning were almost exactly the same. All of these things factored in to making this project a smooth and slightly less stressful process.

## Evaluator: Robbie

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3.5:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/2DoBox-Pivot)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was our final pair project and I worked with Chris Bandrowsky. Working with Chris was the most streamlined pairing experience I've had yet. Right off the bat we did a detailed DTR and layed out our learning and workflow expectations which made our partnership very efficient. I made sure to keep the driver/navigator flow to a 50/50 split which worked well for us. At some points Chris did get a little over eager and tried to do unnecessary work but our dynamic worked in such a way that I was the person there to reel him back in and during our retro he said he appreciated that I was task driven and could keep him on task. I learned a lot from working with Chis on this one as well since he was at a better place with jQuery at the start than I was.

## Evaluator: Bree

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### HTML Style

3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

### Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### (Growth Mindset)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I came from the oil and gas industry which is a very fixed mindset place. While having a growth mindset will get you a promotion, its not always encouraged so it was hard for me to get my head in that place. I have since begun practicing having a growth mindset since being at Turing and it has made me much more comfortable with struggling at things outside of my comfort zone.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Basically I took from this to keep working at having a growth mindset and learn to prioritize the information in front of me. With soo many languages out there its easy to become frustrated and move in to a fixed mindset.

#### (Managing/Coping with Stress)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

I came up with an action plan for things I should try to do daily to keep myself de-stressed and generally leveled out.

* Check in with myself periodically throughout the day to get a feel of what my stress level is
* Talk about my stress with others
* Get outside (get a milkshake on nice days!)
* Start exercising
* Go home and play with the chitlin!

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

A lot of what I heard wasn't really surprising. The industry I was previously working in is riddled with sexism and the boys club mentality. The talks afterwards were good because I was able to come up with some actionable ways to approach the gender gap and lack of diversity in the workplace once I'm in the real world.

### PROtocol
#### Feedback 1

*   [Link to PROtocol Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit#slide=id.g1c505a3b55_0_0)

In previous careers I had recieved similar training but didn't go deeply in to triggers. I found my main trigger was my relationship with the person giving the feedbaack.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding I

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)

*   [Link to LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-gregory)

Your social media is important and if you don't have profile picture you look like a rookie.

#### Learning to Pair

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

*   [Link to DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZIX5vn5UT24zknRPFNsFNeDNe4TBxWDyoierWVJqhw/edit#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg)

I didn't take the DTR form seriously in my first pair project and it came back and bit me. In my second project I did an informal DTR which made things go a lot more smoothly and then in my third pair project we did the DTR in the link above and the project couldn't have gone more smoothly. This concept has been very helpful so far and I look forward to using it in a job setting in the future.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

From me to Chris Bandrowsky: We meshed well I thought. Our workflow was great and It seemed to me that when you wanted to stray from the rubric I was able to rein you back in which was a good dynamic. My experience was really good overall. In the future I would recommend focusing on the project rubric more also not letting the stress of getting stuck hold you back.

From me to Jack Bevis: Thanks for the great pairing experience. I felt like we meshed really well and it seemed like you and I have similar home situations which made it easy for us to come up with an action plan for our project that worked for both of us. Other than the stress of some coding hurdles our project felt seamless. In the future I would recommend just getting up and walking away from the project when you get stuck on a piece of code. It can be easy to sit in front of difficult tasks and grind through them but getting away for a few minutes is always helpful. Thanks for the great experience and I look forward to working on projects with you in the future!

### Being a Community Member

From Spencer Hilvitz to me: Travis has been a huge help to me personally throughout any and all projects that we have worked on. He has been great to bounce ideas off of and it has been really helpful to have him explain concepts that I wasn't understanding. I haven't worked directly with him on a project yet but look forward to working with him in the future. Thanks for all of your help!

From Chris Bandrowsky to me: Pleasure working with you on 2Do Box and on various other things throughout the mod. You're a super smart dude who comes up with solutions that I wouldn't have expected. You're a hard worker that knows how to take care of your work and yourself. I personally can't pick out anything right now that I would suggest improvement on, other than keep being you. You've got a great work ethic and drive to get projects done, and you know how to fend for yourself and learning what you need to. Thanks for the teamwork!

From Jack Bevis to me: Working with Travis was the best pairing experience I had during the inning. We were able to establish a good working relationship from the get go, and how our personal schedules would work for the project. I think we were able to communicate very effectively throughout the project and thus were successful in reaching our goals. Outside of the project, working with Travis is very helpful and beneficial. He’s able to articulate his thoughts well and explain problems and help you work through it.

From Nik Bornemeier: You and I did not work together on any group projects but we did work together on other projects such as Mythical Creatures, etc.  You are always quick to help and not to proud to say if you don't know something and steer someone down the wrong path.  You have a great understanding of Javascript and were gracious enough to help me on multiple occasions.  You will not only be a great developer but you are also an exceptional teammate and friend.  Thanks for all the help!

### Playing a Part

I didn't have the opportunity this mod to join any of the posses specifically but I did attend spikes hosted by most of them. In the future I'm looking forward to working with the incoming mod 1 students in pairing sessions and I'm also talking with some people about running the Turing Podcast. That was very helpful for me as an incoming student and I think it could become a great thing for the school.
