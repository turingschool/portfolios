## D: Professional Skills
Complete

### Gear Up
#### Looking Good (mod4 led gear up)

* We led a Gear Up on Nonverbal communication. It went well. I doubt it changed hearts and minds, but hopefully it helped people think about how nonverbal communication is communication. We included quizes, articles for and against some of the science, and activities to practice. It was nice having the other gear up times set aside to prepare for this. I enoyed working with a team of front and back end students. I learned a good way to stand with my hands while public speaking.
