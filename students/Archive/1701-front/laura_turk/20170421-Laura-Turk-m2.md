## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed my end of module assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lauraturk/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)
* [Evaluation Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1701/mod-2/sorting-sweet/laura.md)

Building three classic sorting algorithms: bubble sort, merge sert, and insertion sort. I enjoyed working through these three and was glad for the practice.

##### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

##### 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

##### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints


#### Complete Me

* [Evaluation Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1701/mod-2/complete-me/laura.md)

Building an autocomplete trie. This was a challenging project, though I enjoyed working through it with my fellow cohort members.

##### Comments

i liked the weighting of the nodes
great use of enumerables

##### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
#####Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lauraturk/frogger-gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)
* [Evaluation Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1701/mod-2/game-time/devin-laura.md)

Building an object oriented frogger game with HTML canvas. Cemented my understanding of object orientation and the importance of building orthogonal applications.

##### Comments

great OO design

would like to see another super class or just have frog, h20, and lilypad inherit from.
Test were solid.

would like to see more tests around the collision.
Great job making the collision agnostic.

Only glaring thing is the index.js

##### Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…
4 - Zero complaints


#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lauraturk/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)
* [Evaluation Notes](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1701/mod-2/weathrly/laura_john.md)

Introduction to React and api calls. I really enjoyed this project. React is fun. Working with APIs is exciting.

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

##### JavaScript / React Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach to design and component architecture.

##### Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
#### feedback to me
Laura is the worst. But actually Laura was awesome. She worked hard and helped us stay on task. I felt that we were an excellent match - we both contributed equally to the project. Her singing made me feel at home as my wife loves to sing to herself as well.
Emoji game was only 9/10. Actually it was perfect, her emojis and her overall communication were excellent. We never really had to resolve any conflicts because we communicated well upfront and thus did not ever get far enough to have conflicts.
Laura needs to watch more star wars. She could also branch out from singing jingles to more full on songs. Honestly though I don't have anything negative to say though I really thought hard about it. Laura helped me many times when I was stuck.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

Empathy is important. These gear up topics are challenging because often the discussion of privilege makes the participants who most could use it defensive about their own privilege and shut down, or conversely makes them think, "I'm empathetic" so they are unable or unwilling to see how their own actions may/may not be encouraging a less welcoming environment. That said, I learned a lot about my discussion group members and feel like I understand them and where they are coming from better.


### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

Grit is an interesting framework for thinking about human behavior and skill acquisition. As such, it is important to remember the limitiations any single framework has for understanding human phsycology. Just because the mainstream has latched on to grit as the pop-phsycology de jour does not mean it is the silver bullet nor does it inherently devalue it's role. What I take away from the discussion of grit is the importance of passion in persevering through difficult tasks. Passion, perhaps more accurately intrinsic motivation, is more powerful for learning than any extrinsic motivation (rewards, pressures, etc.), and intrinsic motivation can be fostered by finding meaning in what you are learning. 

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Is the eventual automation of jobs good or bad? I believe that technology has the potential to be a great equalizing force in our society, but the governmental and social framework must be radically altered for that to happen. As it currently stands, technology does more to isolate low-income, underserved and marginalized communities as jobs are inaccessible without rudimentary computer skills, and there are few opportunities for people to learn and practice those skills or access the tools to do so. Furthermore, especially in CO, we continue to underfund our education system. While I want to believe in the good of automation, I find the pessimism of the current political climate making me more cynical.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I co-lead Pahlka Posse this mod organizing Friday Spikes including a discussion on security and privacy and a haccessibility-thon. I sent out weekly reminders for the posse lunches, and unsuccessfully lead a give-help/get-help session on Monday's.

I attended weekly Joan-Clarke Society meetings and frequently attended imposter lunches.

I paired with Mod1 students on photo-finder and ideabox. Unfortunately, I was not asked to pair frequently, though I made myself available every day of the week. 

#### Community Feedback:  
Laura, I was so grateful for your attention and support during my first week at Turing. You were supportive and encouraging from the moment I walked through the doors at Turing. I was initially overwhelmed with the life change I'd just embarked upon, and I really needed to know that I'd made the correct decision. You welcomed me on my first day and explained the weird clapping thing that happened at the end of wrap up. Thanks for not leaving me in the dark. That was weird. It's still weird.
You also encouraged me to join the imposters lunch. I found a community there that I was definitely in need of. I've subsequently been back every week. I appreciate that you were attuned to my needs and were able to support me in finding resources to accommodate them.
Being able to connect with you in Turing and take advantage of your knowledge and resources has been so beneficial for me. Thank you for all the support. It's encouraged me to find the lost souls in mod1 next time and help them adjust to life at Turing. Your example is the gift that keeps on giving! -squee Mod1 BE
