# (Laura Turk) - (M1) Portfolio

## Front End

I wasn't sure what to expect from Turing. I knew it would be hard work. I knew -to use the cliche- I would be drinking from the firehose, and probably stressed out. My goals for this mod were to establish healhy habits in my life and create productive study habits to set me up for success for the length of the program, as well as keeping up with the material.

## Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

### Evaluator: Bree
### Optional Notes:

* Nice work. Marked improvement and progress.
* Keep pushing on organization in your markup and focus on semantic/accessible considerations
* Next time experiment and get comfortable with in-line svgs
* No pt's on font! Only pixels or ems or rems :)

#### Design Integrity

- 3: The comp accurately reflects the design integrity with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements. While there are areas of improvement, it is a close representation of the original design.

#### Responsive Layout

- 3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

#### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

#### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.



### B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work includes one solo project and three static comps. It is exciting to see the growth I have made these past six weeks, especially with CSS.

##### (Number Guesser)

*   [Number Guesser](https://github.com/lauraturk/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(Description) 
Laura Turk's most humble submission of the coding classic
Number Guesser
Game Rules
User guesses a number between 1 and 100. The initial range is not apparent, but a guess above or below will prompt the user to stay within the appropriate range.

User must first type a number before any of the buttons are active, and -once they have guessed- can click Clear to guess again or Reset the game to clear the input field, their previous guess, and create a new random number.

A winning guess increases the difficulty of the game by dropping the min range and raising the max range by 10.

A non-numerical guess or a guess outside of the range returns "NOPE" and prompts for a number within the range.

This game can be played on a desktop as well as on a mobile phone with a screen size larger than 320px.)

(evaluation comments)
I had too many global variables and should have put more into functions. It was instructive in my evaluation to have Bree explain how that would work.
Revisit layout for the 320 size
Revisit UX for set range and how the user understands and gets feedback about guessing a new number w/in new range
Revisit JS for refactoring around less global variables and looking into case/switch for if/else business
UX/UI Expectations

(description)
An experiment with flexbox, I enjoyed 1. finding an agreeable color palettes, and mining the depths of the Bluth Ipsum. I struggeld with handling the background image and linking to it appropriately (I used 4? to make it repsonsive).

(evaluation comments)
My color palette was good. It didn't work on the large screen, and my background image was screwy.

I set two goals for this 1. don't rely on flexbox and 2. experiment with ems. I am really happy I did not rely on flexbox as it cemented how the box model operates and set me up for success in 3.

(evaluation comments)
Color pallete was good. Font was small.

icons are filler sprites and would be further modified to provide for differentiation.
font-family: Alegreya Sans SC for all caps otherwise Alegreya Sans is used. In a broader application, it may be useful to change these fonts as google rates their load speed as SLOW.

This comp challenge was, indeed, a challenge. It was encouraging to feel like I was beginning to understand how to approach and organize a CSS challenge of this size. Despite that I still feel like my CSS is slow and I look forward to flexing this muscle more.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
I found paired projects to be more challenging than I anticipated. I've done a lot of group and committee work in the past, but it was often 'take these distinct pieces and we'll compile them all together later'. Dividing tasks and pairing on smaller projects that had less defined break points was harder on an interpersonal level. I learned how to divide those tasks, how to support my partner, how to manage my own stress and not try to manage my partner's, and how to speak up when I felt like my partner was getting ahead of me. I am proud of the work in these three projects.

(feedback to me)
February 27, 2017

Laura Turk and I paired on the Link List project.  Working with Laura was great! We got together and laid a solid foundation utilizing the DTR memo. We each communicated our expectations, areas where we wanted to grow, and how we wanted to execute this project together.  

Laura is a true professional and a great communicator.  She’s open to hearing new ideas and willing to step outside the box and implement them. Laura wasn’t afraid to tackle the  parts of the project that were new to her, she jumped in and drilled into every aspect of the project.  

I really appreciated having the opportunity to pair with her.  I think she is going to be a fantastic web developer.

(feedback to me)
I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you throughout the past mod! Whether it had been on IdeaBox, or just talking about things to try using in our code, it's been great to bounce ideas back and forth and see what we come up with.

You have incredible determination to figure out problems. Your knowledge of specific coding principles and the best way to execute them brought us to some great solutions with our project.

After debriefing with IdeaBox, you felt that you were left behind on the coding. While I personally felt otherwise, I think it would be great for you to actively speak up about these things and take a stand for yourself. You're great at speaking what's on your mind already. Personally for me, I would have had a better idea of what was going on if you mentioned that you wanted to double back and refocus on a topic to get a better understanding. You've got an incredible mind to offer to any pairing session, don't be afraid to speak out about something that you want to understand better and try taking over. In the future when we are working together, please, feel free to slow me down or stop me or insist that you want to try something. I'm going to try to not take over in the future.

(feedback to me)
I thought that our partnership went very well and I can't wait to work with you on other projects! You're very receptive to new ideas and made me feel at ease about the deadline. You weren't afraid to assert yourself which is so important and such a great quality to have. You work hard and want to make sure that the people you're around feel included and appreciated, and it shows!
Positivity, support, overall awesomeness.
I think just being less apprehensive to speaking your mind is the only thing that I can suggest working on.

## D: Professional Skills

Finding the work of Carol Dweck on growth mindset and Paul Tough's work on grit brought me to Turing. It was nice to have the opportunity to revisit these topics along with ways to manage stress, how best to learn difficult subjects, discussing the role of gender in programming and our individual strengths. Many of these topics were welcome reminders in the face of new stress learning unfamiliar information. 

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

As a kid there were many topics in school that I was easily successful at and when I wuold struggle (namely, math didn't come easily) I assumed I was inherently not good at it and gave up quickly. Learning about the growth mindset has allowed me to push beyond that mindset and frame difficult things as "Not yet". Triggers for fixed mindset are condecension from those around me, mansplaining, and feeling completely stuck without knowing where to start my research.

### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better At Difficult Things)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Practice practice practice. Break difficult things into smaller distinct things that you can master.

### Gear Up
#### (Managing Personal Stress)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

I have had very stressful situations in my past, and no matter how hard -and differently stressing- Turing may be it will never be as stressful as those. It is important to remember what coping mechanisms worked for me at that point in my life and how I can apply them now. Be aware of when I am getting overly stressed and find 'off ramps' for my stress. My coping mechanisms are gettting enough sleep and walking my dogs while listening to podcasts.

### Gear Up
#### (Personal Narratives)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)

My values continue to be curiosity, critical thinking, fairness and social justice. I have to learn how to apply those things to this new career, how to harness the similarities and differences between my cohort brethern and to keep what is important to me.

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the gender gap)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This is a conversation I've been involved with for a few years now, and I was really pleased to see Turing bring it up. What is missing from the conversation is a broader discussion of how -as a society- we devalue the work women do, and how beyond the 'pipeline' can tech be more welcoming to women. In light of this last week's news around Uber, it is clear that for too long the narrative is that women need to shift their communication styles towards men's instead of finding what is valuable in both styles and building on the shared contributions of all.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Personal Goal Setting)

*   [Workshop URL](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/personal-goal-setting.html)
  
  My personal goals for the module were: I want to give back, so I will find opportunities to volunteer. I want to gain     fluency with these skills, so I will practice, practice, practice. I want a job so I will network and participate in the Turing and Tech community, and I want to keep a school-life balance so I will practice having a 'sabbath' day to recharge.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
##### To Kristi Green
Kristi, working with you on Linked List was a wonderful learning experience and a pleasure. While it was more challenging to pair on a project at Turing than I anticipated -the time pressure, the difficulty of dividing tasks on a project of this size, and my general trepidatious understanding of the material- working with you made a difficult thing inherently less challenging.

Our greatest strength as a team was your proactive approach to communication. I appreciated that you kept the lines of communication open, that you reached out for us to work together, jumped to get us very necessary help, and tried new ways to communicate! I also appreciated your patience with my ‘throw it at the wall and see what sticks’ method of doing css. While it may have (ha! definitely) slowed us down, it was a useful learning experience for me to be more measured and thoughtful in my approach.

I am drawing a blank on any feedback I could give you to improve future partnerships. The only thing would be that we could have both benefited from increased optimization of the git and github workflow, and again, your patience as we figured out how to use that tool was incredible. 

Thank you and I hope to work with you again soon!

#####To Kenia Faris
Pairing with Kenia was a breakthrough for my partner and I. She did an excellent job walking us through the problem and sharing her knowledge with out directly feeding us the code. After just an hour I left feeling much more comfortable with our project and the concepts that we were learning. I would highly recommend people seek her out for pairing!

### Being a Community Member
#####Overall, how was it working with me as a project partner and a human?
You are a great human. I hope we get to do a project together someday.
I never officially partnered with you but I find you to be a delightful human and I enjoy our discussions!
As a human, it was throughly a pleasure. Very kind, but direct.

#####What strengths did I bring to our group?

We were not official project partners, but you provided me a lot of moral support. I enjoyed our conversations and I think we talked about coding some of the time.
Honesty, strong educational background, cute dog pictures
Clear thinking and not afraid to voice any questions.

#####What areas (technical or interpersonal) should I work on?

Don't get a "thicker skin". Find a place to work that you can be you.
I can't think of any. I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful! I do think you did a rad job tackling the pairing conflict you had earlier this mod :)
Believe in yo' self girl. If people you meet wish to talk about coding and its over your head at the time, then make it a moment as a lesson to expand on your knowledge, or just say fuck this, Ima meet people who aren't lame.

I had a great experience pairing with Laura. She had a good understanding of her code an was able to talk me through the problems that they wanted to fix. It was very easy to jump into her code and follow the logic. She is a great problem solver and it was easy for me to guide her to the answer. It was a great pairing and she was very open to receiving feedback and asking questions when something I said didn't make sense. 


### Playing a Part

This mod I focused on participating. I initiated communication among my lunch roulette groups. I joined the Pahlka posse and took advantage of Iron FE.
