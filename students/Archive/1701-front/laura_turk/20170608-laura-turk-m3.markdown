## C: Group Work & Projects

### HeadCount 2.0
### SwapiBox
### MovieTracker
### UI/UX Project

#### (HeadCount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/Headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a DistrictRepository class. After you finish iteration 1 you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the create-react-app boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through the documentation, and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.

#### evaluation comments
##### Students: Laura & Adam
##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
##### Notes:

##### Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

##### Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

##### PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### CSS/Design
- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

##### Testing
- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

##### Feedback
Laura was a great partner to work with on Headcount. She has a solid grasp of JS, React and all the fundamentals necessary to make the project run very smooth. Any difficult challenges we came up against we were able to work together on to conquer and made sure that both members knew what was needed to fix those situations. Not much in way of constructive feedback as the project went very smoothly. 

#### (SWAPI Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
(feedback to me)

#### Feedback
Laura, I learnt a lot while working with you. I especially appreciated how you guided me in writing tests for our application. I think that our communication has been great throughout the entire time. I think you work very hard and have great structure. I think we both need to work on managing stress, when working on new and complex problems under pressure of time. But overall this pairing experience has been great, and I would not mind working with you again. 

#### (UX/UI Project)

* [GitHub URL - Design](https://github.com/jennPeavler/UI-UX-Project)
* [Github URL - Build](https://github.com/lauraturk/UX-UI-project-build)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ultimate-ux-ui-team-challenge.html)

This is a 3-week project broken into three phases. You will be asked to work through the life cycle of a project brief: design, build, and client review/critique.

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

### Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### JavaScript Style

* 2.5: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Testing

* 2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

* 3.5: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

### feedback to me
Laura was an amazing partner for the Movie Tracker project. She attacked all the challenges we encountered, sang while doing it, and consistently made sure her two partners were up to speed. She worked autonomously on some features and then collaboratively while the whole group was together. This sort of multi-pronged approach gave me a lot of confidence that the project would get done and be in good shape. Going forward Laura can continue to improve her prioritzation of addressing issues. There were times when we'd get side-tracked while working to solve specific issues. I think this is a unversal challenge with coding: focusing on the MVP. - Anders

Laura was really quick to jump in to the project and had a good understanding of the material going in. She was able to speak to her decisions and explain to me what was happening when I was stuck. The thing I would most recommend she work on is her awareness of when someone in her group is struggling with the material. This did eventually happen later in our project and Lauras help was greatly appreciated. That help was instrumental in getting me to a point of better understanding of React and Redux. Laura was also really positive even when we were stuck and as a result lowered my stress level. - Travis

## Final Review

### Notes

- Work on working with people who aren't as strong as you 
    - building up this skillset will help you 
    - you're proficient so you'll be intimidating. but thats tyte.
