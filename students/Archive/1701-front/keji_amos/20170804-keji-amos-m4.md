### Instructor Feedback (Brittany)

#### Specification Adherence

* **45 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* **15 points**: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Data Persistence with SQL Database

* **20 points**: The application persists data in a SQL database with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

#### Testing

* **10 points**: Lorem ipsum dolor set amet

#### JavaScript Style

* **12 points:** Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

#### Workflow

* **15 points**: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


### BYOB

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamos1/byob)
* [Heroku URL](https://sensationnel-croissant-26998.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

### Instructor Feedback (Robbie)

#### Documentation

* **7 points** -  The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can easily follow the documentation for using the API.

#### Feature Completion

* **60 points** - Developer has implemented all 10 endpoints, 4 are secured via JWTs and one is a custom endpoint that filters data based on query params. The database is seeded with at least two tables and one relationship.

#### Testing & Linting & Error Handling

* **25 points** - Project has a running test suite that covers most happy and sad paths for each endpoint. Error handling has been implemented but does not cover all possible scenarios or is unhelpful for the end-user. Linter has some errors that need fixing.

#### JavaScript Style

* **30 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### House of Vars

* [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@keji.amos/im-a-front-end-engineering-student-at-turing-school-and-we-were-given-the-task-of-contributing-to-4612f0a7327c)

## C: Community 
### Participation
I served as the leader to Lovelace Posse and attended IronFE. Also, helped other students on projects.

### Gear-up
Planning a gear-up was alright. It's nice working in groups. I would rather have done some sort of class like a spike. If there were an option to do that I think it'd be good.
