## A: End of Module Assessment

#### Code Challenge 1
###### Evaluator: Bree
###### Optional Notes:

* Excellent communication skills! I always knew where you were headed and what you were thinking.
* Good balance of reading the problem and working in small, logical, incremental steps and testing your assumptions along the way.
* Got stuck on the disabled state, but you quickly understood the orders of operations issue at play, as well as took good direction to validate and rule out all the other possible small problems - so good job!

__Progression/Completion__
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

__JavaScript Style__
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

__Workflow__

#### Static Comp 3
###### Evaluator: Louisa
###### Optional Notes:

Nicely done!

__Design Integrity__
* 4: The comp beautifully articulates the original design intent and there are no areas where an instructor would make changes with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements.

__Responsive Layout__
* 3: The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

__HTML Style__
* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

__CSS Style__
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The various projects throughout the mod enabled me to grow and think more like a developer. Starting from a first solo project and jumping into more complicated group works greatly allowed me to envision how to accomplish a goal as a developer.

#### (Number Guesser)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This first project was created to get our feet wet using functional Javascript. Since the project was an individual project, we bore the complete weight of our design and logical decisions for each part of the project.

###### Evaluator: Louisa

* Make sure to pay close attention to the comp and focus on maintaining the size of each element.
* Work on the CSS. Look at reordering the code and restructuring properties to be more easily readable.
* Look at removing spans, rather, try to make sure the styling you're making on whatever with the span can be added with a class.
* Too many media queries.

##### Evaluation Scores:
* *UX/UI Expectations 3*: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

* *Functional Expectations 3.5*: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

* *Fundamental HTML 3.5*: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

* *Fundamental CSS 3*: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

* *Fundamental JavaScript 3.5*: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

#### (Static Comp 1)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/cb-comp-challenge-1)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was the first in a series to recreate the image of a website, but with code. This first one focused on using flexbox to create the grid image and then resize it as the screen gets smaller.

###### Evaluator: Louisa

* Colors look awesome, good job of looking at small elements of the greater image and bringing it into the comp.
* Buttons tend to drop down into main section on page resizing, so this needs work.
* Icons on each

#### (Static Comp 2)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/cb-comp-challenge-2)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This was the second project in the static comp series. This one focused on using a card based layout and rearranging the cards based on a mobile vs desktop form.

###### Evaluator: Louisa

* Be cautious of colors, they're not contrasty enough.
* The top navigation on mobile is too compact. There needs to be bigger buttons because people have fat fingers.

#### (Static Comp 3)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/cb-comp-challenge-3)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This third and final static comp was the most technical and challenging of the bunch. This project resembled sites that one may see on a large scale enterprise platform, or some sort of social media navigational site. The project proved difficult due to the amount of moving parts, but the end outcome closely resembled the comp.

###### Evaluator: Louisa
* Work on refactoring CSS.
* Focus on breaking apart CSS chains, rather than continually adding more onto each other. Think about changing these to classes.
* Watch your margins! Make sure your margins based on the comp match their margins. There is a lot of visual symmetry.
* Work on aligning sections to more utilize visual space.
* Watch out for divs. Sometimes the messiness is needed for some elements, but very much try to make it as clean as possible.

###### Evaluation Scores

*See final assessment above*

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

After starting with a solo project and only every working solo on code in the past, it was an engaging and enlightening experience to work on a project side-by-side with another human being. It was great to use these projects as a means to understand GitHub and Git workflow, in addition to practicing our Javascript and other coding skills.

#### (Linked List)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a project focused on creating a bookmark list. If you found a page you wanted to save for the future, one can enter the title of the page and it's url into an input field and the information is displayed on the side of the page. You can then delete or mark as read each individual bookmark to keep track of what you've wanted to checkout, or things you need to checkout.

###### Evaluator: Robbie

* Workflow needs improvement. Work on making small commits frequently, and make branches for each new feature.
* Missing tally option to add up read bookmarks.

##### Evaluation Scores:
* *Functional Expectations 3.5*: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
Fundamental

* *JavaScript Style 3.5*: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

* *Workflow 2.5*: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

* *HTML Style 4*: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

* *CSS Style 3*: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### (IdeaBox)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/ideabox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was a project focused on storing your brilliant ideas. Ideas were created to be stored in the browser, so that your ideas may persist upon subsequent website visits. Ideas could be marked with a quality level, to mark that your ideas could be Genius, Plausible, or Swill. Additionally, users could search for old ideas as well.

###### Evaluator: Robbie

* HTML looks great, it's clear and concise.
* CSS looks good, but it is overly commented. Keep it simple and concise.

##### Evaluation Scores:
* *Specification Adherence 3* - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* *HTML Style 4*: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

* *CSS Style 3.5*: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

* *JavaScript Style 3*- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* *Workflow 3*- The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

* *Collaboration 3* - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

#### (2Do Box Pivot)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/2DoBox-Pivot)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2Do Box was a pivot on IdeaBox. Instead of storing ideas in local storage, the goal was to refactor and change the code to store ideas into a new 2Do Box. Functionality mostly remained the same from last project, except for a few modifications. We were to have an option to "complete" each 2Do. Additionally, filtering options were increased which focused on having us search 2Do's based on priority. Additionally, there was a focus on creating a Selenium test suite for DOM testing.

###### Evaluator: Bree

* Good try on the testing suite, just make sure to change tests as you change the base code.
* Color scheme is a bit... odd. Looks bad on bigger screens. Test for everything you can in terms of colors.
* Rather than using JS switch statements, why not using an array to get the right priority?
* There can be some refactoring in the JS.
* Instead of filtering by radio buttons, it could be worth investigating the use of check boxes to add up filters. So one could select low priority or critical priority and see both options.

##### Evaluation Scores:

* *Specification Adherence 3* - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* *User Interface 3* - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* *HTML Style 3* - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

* *JavaScript Style 3* - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* *Testing 3*- Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

* *Workflow 3* - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills
Turing has done an excellent job in teaching me interpersonal skills that can apply across the industry and across professional developer interactions. Through Gear Ups, casual conversation, guest speakers, and otherwise, I've learned a great deal about functioning as a Developer in the work world.

### DTR

Defining the Relationship was an invaluable step for ensuring our pairing success in projects throughout the module. DTR's are useful for determining how my partner and I could be the best partners possible.

*   [DTR 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YC89tSP8TDqRxG2YslTk3NKPMezhAxMQEq_0-vS82d0/edit?usp=sharing)
*   [DTR 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZIX5vn5UT24zknRPFNsFNeDNe4TBxWDyoierWVJqhw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth mindset has become something that I think about in my coding interactions. Through this session, I began to think of failure as not necessarily something bad, but rather as the signs of improvement telling me "not yet." A big element for me to be cautious of is comparing myself to other's in regards to success and coding understanding. I should remain positive that I will grow into the skills I am learning, rather than view my shortcomings as definitive facts.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This session very much fit nicely with the concept of Growth Mindset. It isn't difficult to feel put off by the struggles and problems of being a developer. But the successes and the triumphs, no matter how small or large become something worth looking forward to and something to focus on. More than practice makes perfect, practicing the small things, makes permanent. It's better to focus on splitting larger tasks into smaller, easier to handle challenges.

#### Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Stress sucks. Especially when you have 2 projects due, and you have to work on Mythical Creatures, and you're working and your boss wants you to design things for him at a last minute basis. What do you do? Well you've got to manage the stress. Take care of yourself, it is what matters most. For me, getting out of the class and going to do something that gives me personal joy, like taking photos, calling my girlfriend or my best friend, and just removing my mind from thinking about the stress is a good way to put my mind at ease.


### PROtocol

*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit#slide=id.g1c505a3b55_0_161)

### Professional Development Workshops
#### StrengthsFinder

*   [Workshop URL](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/document/d/1cxVCsip9tWlPGMoevt7abtcxZeZZAH25j9rZ9i9gZxM/edit?usp=sharing)

StrengthsFinder was super helpful for understanding my role within our cohort. Talking with Allison and comprehending my strengths of Responsibility, Connectedness, Communication, Individuality, and Adaptability very much helped understand my strengths. The subsequent workshop with other StrengthsFinder takers from my cohort helped understand my friend's strength.

#### Personal Branding

*   [GitHub](https://github.com/cbandrow)
*   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbandrowsky/)
*   [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7004092/cbandrow)
*   [Twitter](www.twitter.com/bnxsy)

The biggest takeaway from this session was an understanding of the value of maintaining an online presence. It is important as a developer to be in contact with a community of developers. It is additionally important to begin branding yourself as a front-end developer, rather than what we were prior.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
###### Feedback for Devon Bull

What can I improve?
* Get some sleep dude. You're a super hard worker and that's amazing, but it doesn't matter much if you haven't gotten enough sleep to operate correctly. Take care of yourself!

What went Well?
* We haven't paired on a project yet, but I've appreciated your advice every time I get it. I appreciate your JS tidbits you give to myself and the rest of the mod.

Would you want to work together again?
* Yes

Is there a way to communicate that you prefer?
* Face to face. Or Slack. Those work well.

###### Feedback for Laura

Overall, how was it working with me as a project partner and a human?

* I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you throughout the past mod! Whether it had been on IdeaBox, or just talking about things to try using in our code, it's been great to bounce ideas back and forth and see what we come up with.

What strengths did I bring to our group?

* You have incredible determination to figure out problems. Your knowledge of specific coding principles and the best way to execute them brought us to some great solutions with our project.

What areas (technical or interpersonal) should I work on?
* After debriefing with IdeaBox, you felt that you were left behind on the coding. While I personally felt otherwise, I think it would be great for you to actively speak up about these things and take a stand for yourself. You're great at speaking what's on your mind already. Personally for me, I would have had a better idea of what was going on if you mentioned that you wanted to double back and refocus on a topic to get a better understanding. You've got an incredible mind to offer to any pairing session, don't be afraid to speak out about something that you want to understand better and try taking over.

### Being a Community Member

###### Feedback from Zane
How have our interactions throughout the mod helped with your understanding of code, or the development of you as a programmer?

* Casually throwing ideas back and forth have opened some doors for on ways to approach problems. It's been helpful throughout the mod.

What are some things I could work on in future mods?
* The biggest impediment you seem to have is yourself. You're a smart dude with a solid grasp of all the material we've covered, but need to stop and breathe when the pressure starts.

Anything else you'd like to tell me?
* Brews?

All things considered, wanna grab a beer?
* Yes, of course!

###### Feedback from Leta
How have our interactions throughout the mod helped with your understanding of code, or the development of you as a programmer?

* I think just casually talking about codes and concepts has helped me really lock in and solidify stuff!

Have our interactions as a whole affected your experience as a Turing student?
* I appreciate that you are also a design nerd who is just as invested in inside jokes as I am :) FOAT FOREVER

What are some things I could work on in future mods?
* Be a little more forgiving of yourself. Don't compare yourself to others so much - it seems like that's a really big stressor for you. Let you be wherever you are, and just work to improve or refine from there - don't try to make someone else's baseline your baseline! I think you'll be happier and more productive.


### Playing a Part

Nothing out of the ordinary. However, I found that some members of our cohort weren't pleased with the headshots taken for our profile pictures. So on portfolio review day, I'm bringing my camera gear and taking some headshots with a better backdrop.
