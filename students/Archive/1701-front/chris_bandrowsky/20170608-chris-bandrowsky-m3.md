## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed(as far as I am aware of)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Car-Tographer is an application that allows upload of an image. The image is then sent to Google Cloud Vision API and identified as several potential possibilities. The data is filtered and matched behind the scenes to accurately convey one or a few possiblities of vehicle makes and models. Clicking the results bring up semi-detailed info from Edmunds about the car. 

#### (Car-Tographer (Personal Project))

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/personal-project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Car-Tographer was built (sort of as a joke, but not really) to allow partners of car-nerds identify the weird car that their partner is gawking at across the street. It evolved into more of a full fledged research application that allows users to get more information about the car. It is a project I would love to continue to refine and build in the future.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects this mod included some intense attempts at API calls, nested API calls, promises, React magic, Redux magic, and other trickery. Definitely, without quesiton, these projects were some of the most difficult concepts we've come across at Turing.


#### (HeadCount 2.0)
HeadCount 2.0 was a project which we took in a data set containing the enrollment percentages of kindergarteners per district in the state of Colorado. We took the data and mapped them out on individual cards. Cards could then be selected and then compared.

#### (SWApi Box)
SWApi Box was a project which focused on displaying Star Wars data based on categories. It focused on doing several api calls to get accurate data. User's could click cards from varying categories

#### (MovieTracker)
MovieTracker is an app built in React, using Redux, Router, Postgress and a backend server. MovieTracker functioned by making an API call to get the recent list of movies from Movie Database. Each movie card contained general important information about the film. Movie's could be selected and saved for reviewing later.
However, the tricky part of the project was that we needed to create an authentication system using a back-end to store users, user login data, and users favorite movies.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Parable of The Polygons
The Parable of the Polygons, or more commonly known as the tragedy of the commons was an intriguing conversation to have. My biggest takeaway is that small individual biases can lead to a large collective bias. These collective bias create unfair situations and segregate a level of society. Creating equality takes work at the barebones level. We need to work and the unit level to make qualified change.  

#### (MicroAggressions)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

The MicroAggressions Gear-Up was probably one of the more effective and interesting gear-ups we've had. My biggest takeway from the session very much encouraged me to think about myself and my words towards others. All the tiny remarks about someone based on their background or their sex or their sexual preference really add up. The saying goes, 'The straw that broke the camel's back' really rings true to the nature of microaggressions and their compounded negative effect that they have on individuals. 

#### (Edward Snowden and Privacy)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

My biggest takeaway from the Privacy gear-up was that despite Edward Snowden having the best interests of the American people at heart, it's difficult to understand all the factors that he could have anticipated or likewise into making the decision to leak NSA documents. Is he a traitor to the US? Not at all, he did what he had to do. But his actions at least had short-term immediate negative consequences on the US and its allies. For me, I think back to the nature of Social Contracts described by Locke and Hobbs throughout their political-philisophical discussions. The Government and its constituents enter a social contract in which the government protects and serves its people in return for power, taxes, and governing ability. Was what the NSA was doing wrong? Sure, but was their use of technology to watch over us within the realm of the social contract? That is the big question still debated today. My take away is that their isn't a right or wrong answer and the nature of such moral dilemmas need to be discussed fully before labeling individuals as traitors or as heros. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I contributed to Turing's community by helping out Mod2 students informally whenever necessary, taking part in Iron FE, helping build Pahlka Posse's community project, and taking part in Demo Night and the Code Fair. 

### Feedback for Me from Colleagues
From Dave Hubertus: Working on movie tracker with a group of four was a great experience. Things came along pretty quickly and communication was plentiful, specially when running into issues or frustrating sections of the project. When we found ourselves frustrated with a topic we could have done a better job of stepping back and getting on the same page, however easier said then done on the 4th hour of trying to send a fetch call to a server when you have never used one before. Overall enjoyable experience and was great to be able to bounce ideas of of multiple people.

### Feedback from Self to Colleagues
To John Binning: You’ve been a super awesome person to sit next to for 3 mods. It’s been great bouncing ideas off of each other, and having each other explain difficult concepts to each other. You are low key the champion of this mod, you stealthily crush it every time and are tremendous support unit for our team. Our mod would be wildly different without you around. You handle challenge and stress with dignity and poise and you hold yourself high during any difficult situation.
