# Chris Jordan - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a better understanding of the other side of the web concerning servers and back-end technologies. I also wanted to expand on my React, Redux, testing, Javascript, and CSS skills. I feel that, besides JavaScript, I have failed miserably. This feeling though only excites and pushes me to do better everyday through working hard every hour towards becoming the best programmer I can be for any web-development outfit.

## Individual Assessment

This module brought me to a understanding of what gaps between where I am and where I want/should be that I wish to fill, quickly. I have been humbled by my experience here during this mod, but I will become a better programmer through sheer grit, through individual, daily study sessions, and by becoming a very active member within the programming community. I have learned a lot these last weeks, but there is much more to learn for me to feel comfortable saying I am a Front End Engineer.

* [Heroku URL](https://sleepy-anchorage-74386.herokuapp.com/)

#### Description

This project consisted of mongo.db, express, knex, react, redux, websockets, and modern javascript. It attempted to make coding a competitive sport by having users face coding challenges against other users in real time. Eventually, I want to expand to allow solo play, tutorials, pair-sessions, and team matches). Users also can create coding questions to challenge each other with.

#### Description

This project brought great insight in how a modern, complex open source code works amongst their many contributors. It was awe inspiring seeing what technologies were being used and how well organized and formatted it all was, as well as readable enough for most to approach comfortably. It also was great to see the extreme detail being put into the steps to updating code through posting issues, assigning those issues, and debating the level of success for the update concerning those issues. It was great to see how detailed commits and prs ought to be for the betterment of everyone contributing towards better code. The project we worked with concerned providing a wonderful user experience of seeing condensed bites of crime data.

## Community

I was a poor participant of the community. I attended almost every morning Iron Man FE and would assist those that reached out to me, but I didn't seek help or give help when not sought.  What I understand now was it takes to be a true community member for the betterment of all was something I was far from being.

The Gear Up group I was involved with was great to work with. Actually learned a lot about how next to tackle learning a new programming language/framework/library. It was nice to see all mod-1, mod-2, and mod-3 students involved with this gear up was engaged and happy with the experience after reading their comments.
