### Module 4 (Front-end)

* **Areas of Emphasis** - briefly describe the goals you had for this mod and if/how you accomplished them

My goal was to get a high level understanding of many advanced concepts, and to learn more about the basic structure of backend development.  I felt that I learned a lot, but the only thig I can truly say that I have a somewhat deep understanding of is how to set up an express app.  It was nice to get a basic understanding of things though, especially web sockets and CI.

* **Rubric scores** - Fill in how YOU would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:
  * End-of-Module Assessment 3 - It worked with a few bugs that I fixed.
  * Individual Work & Projects 3 - BYOB was fun but brutal.  I actually got a 4 on it I think, but it was difficult to give as much polish as I perhaps would have liked to the homeworks with burnout and time constraints.
  * Group Work & Projects 3 - I had a great time working with everyone.  I do find myself wishing I had gotten an opportunity to work with the people I was never paired with, but I did have some great pairings this mod.
  * Professional Development 3 - I completed all PD requirements with a pass
  * Feedback & Community Participation 3 - see below
* **Individual Assessment:** - (Pass)
* **Required Projects** -

* **Community**
  * Summary of how you've contributed to the community
  
  I came in early to pair with mod 1 students.  I also paired with mod 3 students.  I took time during out posse meetings to mentor Mod 1-2 students, giving general advice and leading coding challenges.
  I participated in hosting Iron FE and contributed to the new repo.  I also am in the process of contributing to open source documentation.
  I helped to lead a gear up detailing the importance of contributing to the community and outlining ways to do so.
  I also attended several meet ups.
  
  * A recap of reflections from Gear Up
  
 I found planning the gear up to be of more value than gear ups usually are by themselves.  I got to work with/get familiar with backend students, and I was instantly very invested in the material as I would be helping to present it.  We did our session on giving back to the community.  I was set to lead a session on open source contributions, so that turned house of vars
 into a two birds one stone situation.  I did a live demo of submitting a pr to a turing projects repo, and also pushed myself to contribute to the react-google-maps docs, and am currently in an ongoing conversation with the maintainers about how to structure their docs.  I'm not sure how much the attendees got out of the session, but I found
 it to be my most valuable gear up to date.
