# Dave Hubertus - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I came into Mod 2 with the intentions increasing my skills in javascript, getting comfortable with ES6, and gaining skills with data structures and array/object/string prototypes. After having made my way through Mod 2, I feel comfortable with my ability to assess a problem and find a solution in an orangized matter.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

Front End Module Two Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, ES6, React, JSON, Local Storage, and Enzyme/Jest.


### Sorting Suite

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/dh-sorting-suite)

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. They give us an opportunity to focus on algorithms of various complexity all solving a relatively simple problem.

In this project, you are challenged to implement three fundamental sorting algorithms being bubble sort, insert sort, and merge sort.

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints


### Complete-Me

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/dh-complete-me)

Everybody uses auto complete.You can love it or you can hate it but ultimately you’re going to use it. Sometimes it’s helpful and sometimes it’s just annoying. In this project you are going to be building a low level version of an auto complete system in javascript.

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints



## B: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Front End Module Two Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, ES6, React, JSON, Local Storage, and Enzyme/Jest.


### Game Time

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DBULL7/breakout)

Build a game that is playable in the browser. Use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code. Separate business-logic code from view-related code. Use test-driven design to build a client-side application.

#### Functional Expectations
3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints


### Weatherly

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/CloudKicker-WeatherForecast-ReactProject)

As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api.  Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript / React Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints


### Peer Reivews
Krisit Green - Thanks Dave for pairing with me on mythical creatures, the session was really a big help for me.  We were able to work through a few issues I had with one of the creatures and I left with a better understanding of how to solve it.

Adam Carpenter - Dave and I have paired on two projects now and the projects we have partnered on have gone the smoothest out of any projects I have worked on at Turing. He has a strong grasp of fundamentals, functional programming and the logic behind it that makes working on hard problems with him a lot more enjoyable. He is also great at explaining techniques that I don’t yet have a grasp on and that is why I learn so much when I work on projects with him.


### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turing’s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
