# Dave Hubertus - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I came into Mod 4 with the intentions of gaining a deeper understanding of server side development. I enjoyed building out front and back end portions of our applications as it began to solidify how the two depend upon each other. Hosting our applications also forced me to take a deep dive into understanding configuration files. After having made my way through Mod 4, I feel comfortable with my ability to assess a problem and find a solution in an orangized matter.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects


### BYOB

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/byob)

#### Feature Delivery
##### Documentation
9 points: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can follow the documentation for using the API but has to do some parsing.

##### Feature Completion
50 points: Completed almost all features, but lacking a relationship between the two data tables.

##### Testing Linting Error Handling
30 points: Project has a running test suite that covers happy and sad paths for each endpoint. Error handling has been implemented and linter is passing.

##### JavaScript Style
20 points: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


## B: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### Jet Fuel

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/jet-fuel)

#### Specification Adherence
50 points: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface
15 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Data Persistence with SQL Database
20 points - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

#### Testing
10 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. Tests are commented out/failing currently (CircleCI) - need these to be passing

#### JavaScript Style
12 points - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing. Need more RESTful routes.

#### Workflow
20 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### House of Vars

*   [GitHub URL](https://medium.com/@dhubertus/first-dive-into-an-open-source-project-56cc4635369f)

### Capstone
PASSING



### Peer Reivews
Jack Bevis - “Working with Dave was great. Our goals and work styles gel very well, and from that we are able to communicate very effectively and get things done. Our combined love of Jeopardy only made working on Capstone all the more enjoyable. I totally think we should be able to do technical interviews as a team, it would hilarious.”

Gear Up Feedback - 
1) I liked it, it is nice to get the perspective of people who are going through the same learning process.
2) As I assume this is a mandatory event that mod 4 students must put on...they all felt very engaged and enthusiastic about the topic.
3) Discussions, movies, small groups were well-timed, the mod-4 students were active in the discussion. 

### Gear UP

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1706-inning/group_two.md)

* Gear up was good experience in public speaking and allowed myself to share intrest and knowledge on a topic I enjoyed. I found working with my group during our gear up session enjoyable as it was nice to actually hang out with some mod 4 BE.

### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. Additionaly I have participated in Iron Fe on a regular basis since the end of Mod 1.
