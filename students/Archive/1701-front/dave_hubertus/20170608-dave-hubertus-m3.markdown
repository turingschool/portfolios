# Dave Hubertus - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I came into Mod 3 with the intentions increasing my skills in javascript, getting comfortable with React, Redux, and Router while improving data manipulation skills and javascript async skills. After having made my way through Mod 3, I feel comfortable with my ability to assess a problem and find a solution in an orangized matter.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects


### UFO-Tracker

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/ufo-sighting-google-maps)

#### Feature Delivery
##### Completion
3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.
##### Organization
3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

#### Technical Quality
##### Test-Driven Development
3.5: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
##### Code Quality
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

#### Product Experience
##### User Experience
3.5: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
##### Performance
3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.


## B: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### HeadCount2.0

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/headCount2.0)

#### Specification Adherence
3: The application completes 5 iterations.

#### Code Quality
3: Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation
Pass: Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design
3.5: Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing
3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.


### SWAPI Box

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/SWAPI-Box)


#### Specification Adherence
3: The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality
3: Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design
4: Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing
3.5: Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Movie Tracker

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamos1/movie-tracker)

#### Redux Architecture
3 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing
3 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

#### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing
2.5 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

#### Workflow
3.5 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.



### Peer Reivews
Jack Bevis - Working with you on Headcount went really well. We have a pretty strong rapport to begin with and brought the same attitude to the project. As such we were able to accomplish the goals for the project, and burn through some tough challenges in order to do so. I also want to say thanks again for shouldering a brunt of the project over the weekend while I was out of town. That was not ideal, but we were able to get it done. Great pairing, and looking forward to more collaboration.

Jenn Peavler - Dave communicates expectation and roles clearly.  He is approachable and adaptable.  He has a solid understanding of the subject manner and is able to express his thought process clearly.  He works relentlessly to get the job done, and takes pride in his work.  In order to grow as a developer, it is my recommendation that Dave keep up the good work, but perhaps sometimes, take a step back from the project and look at the flow of the application as a whole.  This will enable Dave to be able to understand how to break up the whole project into smaller, more attackable functionality problems.  Can’t wait to work with Dave again, as he most definitely rocks.

Chris Bandrowski - Working with Dave was a great experience, especially in a group setting. It was enjoyable to constantly bounce ideas off of each other to see where we could go with the project. Although the project was stressful, it was great to work with Dave and the others as they were great supportive team mates.

Keji Amos - You are a great teammate. You are good at staying on top of todos and making sure if there are questions they get answered.

### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turing’s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
