# Dave Hubertus - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  Entering Turing, I had little to no experience with programming. I was unsure what to expect or even how to set a goal for a topic I knew little about. Understanding the fast pace of the program Id have to say my goals were to be able to comprehend the subject matter in a quick manner and keep pace with the guidelines set forth by Turing and its curriculum. Now, having completed module one, I am pleased with the progress I have made as an individual and as team.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mind Set

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Growth Mind Set is a valuable mental state which should be more widely practiced throughout education systems. Growth mind set is something Ive unknowingly practiced throughout many aspects of life, however not as much when it comes to education. Having this mind set and applying it to my education with Turing has been very helpful as there are many times through out each project where its easy to feel lost or unaccomplished.

#### Debugging Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

Debugging the gender gap brings up a very interesting and very valuable concept while identifying a cultural imbalance of men and women in programming. The concept of perspective is addressed heavily in the film and is something Ive practiced a good portion of my life. Having grown up in a diverse area and gone to college in a not diverse state it was eye opening how perspective can be lost. Throughout my first module with Turing, I believe this has been the most valuable gear up session. Perspective should be practiced and exposure to issues and problems that don’t typically effect ones life is highly beneficial.

### PROtocol
#### Giving Good Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback is a learned skill that can only be improved through practice. When giving feedback, its important to practice empathy and have perspective. Communication is key whether there is and issue that needs to be addressed or everything is great. When receiving feedback its important to curb emotions and extract all valuable information while passing over criticism that may otherwise cause friction. Again having frequent communication is highly important to a functional partnership.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To: Adam Carpenter

Working with Adam was a great experience. We were up front about what we both wanted to get out of the experience and decided early on how we were going to attack the project. Our ideal work times were discussed and since we both wanted a hand in every aspect of our project we essentially built each part together.  Adams skill set and ability to communicate well made our first pairing very successful even when the struggle was real.

To: Jenn Peavler

Working with Jenn was a solid experience. We communicated fairly well and often enough that we were typically on the same page.  We struggled on a few aspects of the project, but it was Jenn who would take the first step back to break the problem down into much more simple tasks. This proved to be the most valuable part of the experience as I have a tendency to take on too much at once.

Gave Ciara feedback through a google form.

### Being a Community Member

From: Adam Carpenter

Dave was a great teammate to work with. Together we were able to battle some very difficult bugs we came across in a very short amount of time. Some of the problems we faced, mod 2 pairing and instructors were not able to figure out what was going on, yet we prevailed. His work ethic is strong and his comprehension of Javascript, HTML and CSS is very well rounded and made building an app with him a lot of fun. Let’s go!

From: Jenn Peavler

Dave communicates expectation and roles clearly.  He is approachable and adaptable.  He has a solid understanding of the subject manner and is able to express his thought process clearly.  He works relentlessly to get the job done, and takes pride in his work.  In order to grow as a developer, it is my recommendation that Dave keep up the good work, but perhaps sometimes, take a step back from the project and look at the flow of the application as a whole.  This will enable Dave to be able to understand how to break up the whole project into smaller, more attackable functionality problems.  Can’t wait to work with Dave again, as he most definitely rocks.

From: Ciara Bujanos

I felt like our project was successful because we  had really good communication the whole time. It was helpful for me to work with you because you were good at articulating your thoughts and breaking down the problems. You were also really good at Googling to help find solutions!  In terms of constructive feedback I'd say that it's great you like to figure all the solutions out between the team, but if we are spending too much time on something to start asking around to the others sooner to see how they solved it.

### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turing’s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
