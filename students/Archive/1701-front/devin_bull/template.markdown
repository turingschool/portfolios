-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge # 1 (DOM Manipulation)

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Optional Notes:

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* good communication skills! bravo!
* great job assessing the problem to solve piece by piece, especially in identifying the connection between mermaid and sailor
* be cognizant of balancing research with trying things out. you show signs of potential "churn" in your research, when if you would experiment a bit more, you could rule out options faster + learn a bit more about how things are working. :)

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Design needs to be polished for a passing score.
* At the same time, revisit your markup and css to refactor and improve upon the code base before submission

### Design Integrity

- 2:  The comp is missing major design elements and/or incorrectly applies design with respect to any number of major deviations across color, layout, sizing, imagery, graphical spatial relationships.

### Responsive Layout

- 2:  The comp fails to employ multiple breakpoints and the design is severely compromised at either extreme of small (mobile) or large (flat screen) size.

### HTML Style

- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Collection of assignments and challenges over the course of the mod.

#### Number Guesser

*   [Project Github](https://github.com/DBULL7/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/number-guesser.md)

Number Guesser was our first Javascript project. We took basic input and checked if it was within a range. Based on how close they were to the randomly generated number, the game would give the user feedback in the form of messages, color changes, etc. 

######Assessment Feedback and Scores
Address alignment issues at the larger screen sizes
Adress colors for enabled/disabled state on buttons
Address redundant and overwriting CSS
Consider putting back the focus on inputs for accessibility, but you can change the color to match your project palette
See if you can refactor that if/else statement. Check out JS switch statements.

UX/UI Expectations
3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


#### Static Comp 1

*   [Project Github](https://github.com/DBULL7/static-challenge-1)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/m1-static-comp-1.md)

We were asked to make a simple project to improve our CSS skills. Our project was shown and evaluated in front of the class.
 
Feedback: Incomplete. 


#### Static Comp 2

*   [Project Github](https://github.com/DBULL7/static-comp-2)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/m1-static-comp-2.md)

More complicated CSS project to learn/test Flexbox if we so chose. 
 

Evaluation Comments: Make the height equal to the page on large screen sizes. Add polish.


#### Static Comp 3

*   [Project Github](https://github.com/DBULL7/db-comp-challenge-3)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/m1-static-comp-3.md)

Final CSS project. Builds upon the previous static comps. We were scored on this as part of the finals week assessments.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Paired projects 

#### Linked List

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DBULL7/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/linked-list.md)

First Pair project, and first project to utilize Github on a team project. We utilized jQuery to take user input and generate html cards to the DOM which the user could then mark as read or delete the card. Fun bonus: we made two Regex statements to verify the user was inputing a 'real' link.

Assessment:

Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

2DoBox-Pivot took fellow students code repository of ideabox and refactored it into a new project. Several new features were added, mostly about retrieving items from local storage based on certain search criteria. We also created Selenium tests to test page functionality.

Evaluator: Louisa

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things


*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This Gear Up really helped accelerate my learning of a few key things. Using the idea of directing focus to quickly go from "A to C" in learning/mastering subjects I was able to learn Selenium in 3 days and Unit Testing in 10hrs.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Let Zane know that sometimes he can overwhelm people who ask him for help due to his speed.

Encouraged Chris Jordan to become more active in the community.

### Being a Community Member

A healthy dialogue about coding problems, the future of the cohort, and an earnest and good natured disposition make you easily approachable a pleasure to hang out with. Just don't die from lack of sleep. - Zane

You're very easy to talk to and are always willing to help. - Kristi

Work on time management so some projects aren't last min - Chris Jordan

Communication throughout the project was very good. Using the tools on Github allowed us to work more in sync because there was a clear list of todos for each of us to get done. - Keji

I think we worked really well together. We were able to establish what we hoped to accomplish in the project from the get go, and we understood that no matter what the project had to get done. - Jack

Get some sleep dude. You're a super hard worker and that's amazing, but it doesn't matter much if you haven't gotten enough sleep to operate correctly. Take care of yourself! - Chris Bandrowsky

### Playing a Part

Held a Spike session on [Selenium testing](https://github.com/DBULL7/selenium-spike)
