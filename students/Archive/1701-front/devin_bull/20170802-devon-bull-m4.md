 ## Community
 
 I contributed to the community in the following ways:
 
 To my cohort:  
 
 * Assisted my classmates with Heroku, Express, Database Schema setup through in-person/Slack/ScreenHero. I really felt that this mod
 was one where I bonded the most with my classmates and really earned their trust to help on problems. 

 To the community:
 
 * Ran a posse: had Ian Douglas come and answer our questions. Helped my posse explore/begin a personal site. Provided an warm environment to help each other.
 
 * Helped Backend M4 with jQuery, JS, Express and React(!!!). 
 
 * Helped M1 FE with jQuery/localstorage.
 
 * Created a cool capstone that may be used by students in the future for practice/fun.
 
 
 ## Feedback
 
 Devon was a tremendous source of knowledge while I was building my first React project. 
 He was able to speak to React programming paterns to help design my application. 
 Additionaly, he was able to jump in my code and recognize snippets that were 
 prime for refactoring to improve code readability and quality.

 ## Gear up
 
 The repo for our group can be found [here](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language/blob/master/administrative/m4-gear-up-outline.md)
 
 Leading the gear up was very rewarding. Our group led the session about when and how to learn a new programming language or technology.  
 In the gearup I led a group that explored Java: sytax, pros and cons. The group created a new Turing Slack channel and invited all the participating students. We also made a repo for anyone to drop in resources 
 they have found useful for new programming languages. A kind of Rosetta stone for code.

 ## Additional Notes
 
 Turing has been fantastic and M4 was a firehose of new and old concepts. I really enjoyed the lectures and all the time
 and thought the staff/instructors put into every aspect of the curriculum. This mod really made clear that there is so much to learn and so much to improve.
 I'm thankful for everything.
