# Ciara Bujanos - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I set out to build on my fundamental HTML and CSS skills and develop working knowledge of JavaScript. JavaScript was entirely new to me coming into the program so I knew I would need to spend majority of my time focusing on it. A few weeks into the module it was apparent I needed a better understanding of it and how it ties in with HTML and CSS so I tried seeking out as much help as possible.

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/buji405/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description: Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

Evaluator: Robbie

Evaluation comments: refactor project to practice javascript fundamentals.

Scores: 
UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations

2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

Fundamental CSS

2.5: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript

2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/buji405/linked-list)
*   [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description: With two input fields and a button add a bookmark to the page with a title and url section. Should also have buttons to mark as read and also to remove the bookmark. 

Evaluator: Robbie

Evaluation comments: Don't use clone, use append. Be more consistent with choosing jQuery or vanilla JS. Could use some refactoring and also group together CSS that has same styling to reduce repetition.

Scores: 
Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Definitely some refactoring here (overwriting variables not needed...)

Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Idea Box

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/buji405/idea-box)
*   [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description: With two input fields and a button add a bookmark to the page with a title and url section. Should also have buttons to mark as read and also to remove the bookmark. 

Evaluator: Bree

Optional Notes:

Gave them until Tuesday after Prez day to finish up for re-scoring.  *I did add in the missing elements but we did not ever meet back up to re-score.

Scores:
Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

JavaScript Style

2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

Workflow

2.5 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

Collaboration

2.5 - Team members shared equitably in the workload, however there are only a few pull requests, which are not labeled or documented very well.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot
[DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7J3gk6gBuHhzh4tQsk6u0JtrY1HhdoxlonxTnUJ5p8/edit?usp=sharing)

Description: Refactor IdeaBox adding in new features and use selenium testing.

Evaluator: Louisa

Scores:
Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite. The test suite covers all aspects of the application.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The idea of a growth mindset was completely new to me but makes perfect sense. In an environment like Turing it's very easy to compare yourself to others and put yourself in a specific category. Practicing a growth mindset has really helped keep me going in Turing. Remembering to keep a growth mindset can be hard, but I tried to keep taking frustrating situations as a learning experience rather than letting frustrations take over.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Dave:

- I felt like our project was successful because we solid communication the whole time. It was helpful for me to work with you because you were good at articulating your thoughts and breaking down the problems. You were also really good at Googling to help find solutions!  

- In terms of constructive feedback I'd say that it's great you like to figure all the solutions out between the team, but if we are spending too much time on something then start asking around to the others sooner to see how they solved it. I also think learning some keyboard and Atom shortcuts will help with speeding up workflow.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Bucket:

- Well, there was that one time way back in the day, when we were young reckless, when you and I paired together. I found that you were intuitive, interested, and keen to learn. I was grateful to have been paired with you and enjoyed our time together. You've got a relaxed attitude and I think that in particular is a very important trait to keep up. 

- The most noticeable area for improvement that I noticed was your code 'handwriting'. I'd urge you to continue to be sure that your syntax and style are consistent from top to bottom. 

Feedback from Dave: 

- Partnering on the 2dobox pivot was very successful. It felt like we both knew the direction we were headed the entire time, and when we didnt we made sure to pause until we were both on the same page. Personally thought there was solid communication the entire way.

- We probably should have searched for help a little sooner on certain areas we were stuck on, but thats mostly on me since I just keep heading down rabbit holes. 

Feedback from Casey Cross:

- Ciara demonstrates an eagerness to learn.  She is always willing to seek help and constructive feedback on her code.  She does not give up, even when things get tough and thus she has grown significantly in her skills this module.

- I would recommend to spend some extra time studying up on core JavaScript principles to further solidify your understanding.  Maybe spend some time over the break doing some CodeSchool or other online interactive tutorials. 

### Playing a Part

This module I joined the Verou Posse, which proved to be interesting and fun. It was cool to get some exposure to more advanced javascript and meet people from other mods. I also participated in a few of the lunch roulette sessions which was another nice way to meet people in the turing community.
