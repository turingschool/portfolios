# Anders Wood - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I made a lot of progress this mod getting comfortable with React and Redux and manipulating information in javascript in general. It was fun to learn a new framework and start to feel like a full-fledged front-end developer.

#### Goals For Mod-4 And Beyond
* Focus on the learning and not on far we get with the projects.
* Get comfortable with back-end pieces and deploying projects.
* Take more advantage of Turing resources such as mentoring and pairing
* Provide pairing to earlier Mods going forward
* Explore jobs/industries that I want to pursue and network with meetups and other events
* Continue to improve maintaining balance between Turing and life (e.g. exercise, sleep, family time etc.) even in the middle of challenging projects and periods.

## Rubric Scores
Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass

## Projects

### HeadCount 2.0

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danielbucket/headcount2.0)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 challenged our skills for manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. We pulled stubbed educational data and organized the information in a way that a user could digest and compare it.

###### Group Members: Anders, Bucket
###### Evaluators: Meeka, Nate, Taylor

#### Notes:
* Team felt that project went well. Worked up to the deadline but steady the entire time.
* Extremely clean interface, really great work there!
* Need to use lifecycle methods / passing callbacks - setting global variables in app instead of using state updating correctly. Look into batch updating state and passing callbacks.
* In tests, mock functions not being used successfully yet - make sure to spend some time on wrapping your head around this problem.
* Recommendation for Rest of the Morning:
- Getting mock jest function test passing
- Try to remove global variables in the App component but using callbacks to setting state or different lifecycle methods

#### Scores

##### Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

##### Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

##### PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### CSS/Design
- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

##### Testing
- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### SwapiBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/SWAPIbox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SwapiBox was our introduction to lots of fetch calls and promises. We hit the [Star Wars API](http://swapi.co/) many, many times to collect information about characters, planets and vehicles. We then displayed all this information with React.js.

###### Group Members: Anders, Zane
###### Evaluators: Meeka

#### Scores

##### Specification Adherence
4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality
3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design
3.5 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


### Movie-Tracker

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/movie-tracker)
*   [Production Site](https://themovietracker.herokuapp.com/)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This was our first Redux project. We used redux and routers as well as a pre-packaged backend to display movie information using an API that pulls from The Movie DB site.

###### Group Members: Anders, Travis, Laura
###### Evaluators: Meeka

#### Scores

##### Specification Adherence  
* 3: Fixed missing features that needed to be finished. Squad.
* // 2.5: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

##### Redux Architecture
* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

##### Routing
* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

##### JavaScript Style
* 2.5: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

##### Testing
* 2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

##### Workflow
* 3.5: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

### Personal Project: Stash Tracker

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/stash-tracker)

I built a site to track back country skiing routes and zones using React/Redux. The app incorporates google maps API to track the information. I'm happy with the product, I think I did a good job achieving the MVP. I was frustrated that I couldn't get Redux to work well with the google maps data.

###### Group Members: Anders
###### Evaluator: Taylor

#### Scores

##### Feature Delivery
**1. Completion**
* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**
* 3.5: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

##### Technical Quality

## Gear-Ups

### Tragedy of the Commons
This was an awesome discussion about how the amount of bias affects the environment around us. The animation illustrated how small shifts in our levels of bias can have a large impact on the level of diversity and inclusivity around us. This is both powerful and scary- we can have a large positive impact by lowering our bias, and adversely, a large negative impact by raising it a small amount. I shared this 'Parable of the Polygons' animation with my partner who is a middle school teacher as I think it's a great way to visualize this concept.

### Microagressions
We read several articles and discussed what microagressions are. I think these are really interesting. As a straight, white, male I don't experience microagressions directly very much. It was powerful to see how affected some of my classmates are by microagressions though. This cemented for me the importance of being an ally and supporting those affected directly by microagressions. As I saw directly during this session, it can be exhausting to constantly be on the receiving end of microagressions. My goal is to stand in solidarity with those being directly affected and help point out to those carrying out microagressions (oftentimes unknowingly) how they can refine their comments/behavior.

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)
This was a really interesting discussion led by the Mod-4 group. We learned that UBI is providing a set amount of money to everyone with no strings attached. One economic theory is that a UBI will be necessary if the middle class continues to go away. I think this concept makes a lot of sense and definitely warrants more study. Part the large appeal to me is that it seems like it's a concept that could appeal to both liberal and conservative folks- a bipartisan solution to wage inequality and the disappearing middle class?


## Feedback and Community Participation

### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Travis:
Working with Anders on MovieTracker and the UX/UI project was a great learning experience. Listening to him work through problems helped me come to a better understanding of how Redux works. At times though I did find his process to be a little confusing and hard to keep up with as we worked in our group. My biggest recommendation would be to be more empathetic/aware of when teammates are struggling with project material. There were times during our project that I felt somewhat dismissed because of my shaky understanding but in the end though, post project, Anders took the time to really go through Redux and help me come to a better understanding of the flow of data. Without that pairing time I doubt I would have the understanding I now have of Redux. If he has time in mod 4 I think it would be to my benefit to pair with him more. Anders is a very organized, driven, developer and I look forward to working with him in the future.

#### Feedback from Laura:
Anders, I am so glad we got to work together. I felt like our strengths complemented each other extremely well. Your methodical approach and understanding of JS and react helped move our project forward, and you kept me from diving down unnecessary rabbit holes (sometimes). While we were all learning Redux, it was instructive to see how you tackle learning new things and working through problems. Furthermore, your communication is excellent. You are a conscientious communicator; making sure to involve your partners, value everyone's input, and drive us towards the MVP.  The challenge of this project -besides the technical challenges- was the disparate levels of our group, and I would encourage you to find ways to balance the needs of the project with the needs of your partners, remain encouraging, and communicate expectations for others without taking on too much responsibility for yourself.

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Laura:
Laura was an amazing partner for the Movie Tracker project. She attacked all the challenges we encountered, sang while doing it, and consistently made sure her two partners were up to speed. She worked autonomously on some features and then collaboratively while the whole group was together. This sort of multi-pronged approach gave me a lot of confidence that the project would get done and be in good shape. Going forward Laura can continue to improve her prioritization of addressing issues. There were times when we'd get side-tracked while working to solve specific issues. I think this is a universal challenge with coding: focusing on the MVP.

#### Feedback for Travis
Working with Travis on the movie tracker project was a great experience- he was always upbeat and fun to work with- which is critical during a hard project. If I got frustrated with the project or hangry, it was always nice when Travis would crack a joke to lighten things up. Redux didn't click with Travis at first but he stuck with it, doing tutorials in his own time to help the concepts stick. I really admire this perseverance and doggedness- I think it will serve him well in his developer career. I'm looking forward to working with Travisv going forward.

### Playing a Part
I've tried to support and help build community within our mod by engaging in the discussions and gear up sessions- sometimes this is exhausting but I think it's worthwhile to help me grow personally and help our community gel more. Per some of my feedback, I think I can do a better job of being cognizant of how well the people in my cohort and groups are learning rather than how far along we are with the project itself. I've tried to be aware of this, but can do better. Lastly, I served as our student advisory board representative.
