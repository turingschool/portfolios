# Anders Wood - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

This Module my primary goal was to advance to Module 2. Additionally I sought to get familiar with Turing and the Turing community to understand how to succeed and get the most out of my time here. Skill-wise I wanted to establish a solid foundation in HTML, CSS and Javascript so that going forward I can learn new skills quickly.

I entered the program feeling well prepared: I completed all the pre-work and had a technical background that included some coding experience. I think this preparation and background served me fairly well during the first Mod: I completed all the required parts of all the projects and felt like I learned a LOT. However, I did still experience the "drinking-from-a-firehouse" feeling a lot of the time.

Goals For Mod-2 And Beyond
-Take more advantage of Turing resources such as mentoring and pairing
-Provide pairing to earlier Mods going forward
-Explore jobs/industries that I want to pursue and network more
-Improve maintaining balance between Turing and life (e.g. exercise, sleep, family time etc.) even in the middle of challenging projects and periods

Below are projects I completed without a partner.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

## Evaluator: Robbie

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/apw-comp-challenge-3)
*   [GitHub Pages](https://anderswood.github.io/apw-comp-challenge-3/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

I used most of the same content as the comp with some updated colors. Donald Drumpf is the user in the comp.

Notes/Comments/Feedback:
-Pay attention to the proportions of space between elements as the window changes size: e.g. increasing the space between menu items with flexbox doesn't alway look good. It may be better to apply a max width and center menus/items with auto margins.

### Scores
3s in all categories

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

###Description
Recreate the static comp specified below as a responsive webpage that works across Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/apw-comp-challenge-2)
*   [GitHub Pages](https://anderswood.github.io/apw-comp-challenge-2/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I created a Zoolander themed page.

Notes/Comments/Feedback:
-Pay attention to the spacing between elements at different browser sizes. This can be easy to miss if I get hung up other details such as colors or aligning elements.
-Don't overdue the box-shadow, a little bit of shadow goes a long way- use lighter colors and smaller border sizes.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

###Description
Recreate the static comp specified below as a responsive webpage that works across Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/apw-comp-challenge-1)
*   [GitHub Pages](https://anderswood.github.io/apw-comp-challenge-1/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

I created a Morgan Freeman themed page.

Notes/Comments/Feedback:
-Putting the image in the "Background" property in CSS is an effective way to implement an image as wallpaper/background.
-Flexbox is powerful and useful and implements a lot of functionality with limited CSS code.
-Avoid hard widths and heights! Use "min" or "max" widths and heights and percentages.


#### Number Guesser

## Evaluator: Robbie

###Description
Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

My partner Keji and I inherited someoneâ€™s previous IdeaBox and pivoted it over to 2DoBox. We implemented acceptance tests using selenium webdriver.

## Evaluator: Bree

### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### HTML Style
3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

### Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


#### Idea-Box

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/idea-box)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

My partner Justyna and I built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas. The application updated the DOM and stored the ideas in local storage.

-Key: repetition and breaking skills into small skills
-Do HIGH quality examples

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####Feedback for Pam:
Pairing with Pam was great. Pam provided helpful guidance without giving us the answer. She did this by looking at our code and seeing the direction we were moving so that her guidance was specific to our work. Pam's support was helpful because she had the expertise in general and specifically she was familiar with our project. She is also nice and friendly, so that was awesome.

####Feedback for Keji:
Working with Keji on the 2DoBox-Pivot was awesome- we made quick progress and did well on the project. We hit one snag where we couldn't agree on the approach to solving a problem: we were coming at the problem from opposite sides. Eventually we resolved it by just marching forward with one of the possible solutions. Keji had the wherewithal to address the frustration after the fact, saying something like "we should have communicated better there". I think this showed a strong awareness of what makes group work go well. Keji is  also nice and fun, so that's awesome to boot.

### Being a Community Member

####Feedback from Pam:
Pairing with Anders on LinkedList was a great experience. He is very open to feedback and is very quick to take the initiative when it comes to his own learning. Per my suggestion, he was ready and willing to implement jQuery into his project - despite only being introduced to it the day before. There wasn't a moment when Anders was simply waiting for me to just hand him the answer - he was very engaged throughout the whole pairing. I have no doubt that his initiative and positive attitude will serve him well in future mods.

####Feedback from Justyna:
I had a good pairing experience with Anders. We planned our work schedule right away. Most of the time we worked together, going though challenges and discussing solutions. We had some minor scheduling differences and had to work separately. We communicated on the code even when we were not working sitting next to each other. We always made sure we walked each other through any changes made and everything was clear to each one of us. Our communication was very good. I learned a lot while pairing with Anders.

####Feedback from Amanda:
Thanks for being such a fantastic partner on LinkedList. I found our pairing to be particularly useful to my understanding of the material, and I really appreciated your positivity (it gave me confidence when I needed it most). You worked hard to help me understand the technical aspects that weren't yet solidified by speaking though the code clearly, and asking me for my input. Not only are you knowledgable about the material, but you can explain it in multiple ways. When we had a question about a next step, you were very thoughtful about the advice we received. I have no doubts about you being an amazing addition to any team - or individual project - because you have technical skills, drive, compassion, and can communicate very effectively.


### Playing a Part

I've tried to support and help build community within our mod by engaging in the discussions and gear up sessions- sometimes this is exhausting but I think it's worthwhile to help me grow personally and help our community gel more. I have also tried to help others in our mod when I'm not feeling totally underwater myself.
