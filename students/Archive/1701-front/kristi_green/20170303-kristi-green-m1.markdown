-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1

## Evaluator: Bree
## Optional Notes:

* Still struggling with fundamentals in constructing functions and targeting elements
* It is clear you can grasp the concepts, just need more and regular practice writing code

### Progression/Completion

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process)

# Pentathlon: Mermaid Mythical Creature Assessment

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Struggled with logic and JS syntax, had difficulty understanding how to make forward progress on solving the problem without a fair amount of handholding/support.

### Progression/Completion
* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Problem Solving
* 2: Developer requires step by step instruction to write effective code and struggles with researching and applying documentation

### Workflow
* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process.


### Static Comp Challenge 3

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Needs refactoring. At desktop sizes, this is a good match for the comp. It needs polish and work, and the code itself needs to be revisited, refactored and tightened up.

### Design Integrity

- 2: AT DESKTOP SIZE ONLY: The comp begins to reflect the design integrity with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements. While there are areas of improvement, it is a close representation of the original design.

### Responsive Layout

- 1:  The comp is not responsive at any size.

### HTML Style

- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

### CSS Style

- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (NumberGuesserProject)

*   [https://github.com/kristing40/NumberGuesserProject]()
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]()

(This project utilizes HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
 The idea is to guess the number that the computer has guessed.
 The user will receive one of three predetermined messages based on their guess.
 The project incorporated fundamental javascript programming to obtain the value from input fields and use that information to determine the output. We disabled and enabled buttons at certain states, by providing inline attributes to disable the buttons and incorporating javascript to later enable them.)

(evaluation comments and evaluation scores)

## Evaluator Louisa

UX/UI Expectations

Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

3.5: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

(feedback to me)


#### (IdeaBox)

*   [https://github.com/Adamj1232/idea-box]()
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]()

(This project involved the use of HTML5, CSS, and responsive design for the interface.
We utilized javascript and JQuery to apply interactivity to the interface.)

## Evaluator: Bree

(evaluation comments and evaluation scores)

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### (2DoBoxPivot)

*   [https://github.com/kristing40/2DoBox-Pivot]()
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html]()

(The idea behind the 2DoProject is to utilize local storage and persistence, dynamically add classes to
show and hide data, and create acceptance test for existing functionality from a previous project.
We refactored the existing codebase and created additional acceptance tests for new functionality.
And modified the existing interface to include new features)

## Evaluator: Robbie

Specification Adherence and evaluation scores

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.)

Project: _____Linked List________________________________________________________
Group Member Names: ___Kristi Green and Laura Turk__________________________
Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? Goals and expectations:

Schedule Expectations: When are we available to work together and individually?
@ Turing till 5 at latest, break till 6:30/7 and then available at home after.
Kristi @ Turing by 8 (Laura tries to arrive by 8, not always successful)
Communication Expectations: How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?
Communicate frequently
Prefer written (slack) or in person.
Haven’t tried screenhero, but are open to it.
Abilities Expectations: Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement:
Not sure about git workflow
Strengths (for both): collaborative (explaining concepts) and communicative
Workload Expectations: What features do we each want to work on?
Divide tasks:
Phase One
The user should be able to input a title and URL into the appropriate fields
(Kristi)When the user clicks on the button for creating the bookmark, it should be added to the bookmarks section
(Laura)When the user clicks on the “Mark as Read” button:
                A class of .read should be added to the bookmark
              If it already has the class of .read, it should be removed
(Kristi) When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the link should be removed from the page
Phase Two
(Laura) If the user omits the title or the URL, the application should not create the link and should instead display an error.ADD THE CSSS LAURA S
The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile. (Flexbox is your friend here.)
Phase Three
(Laura)The button for creating links should be disabled if there are no contents in the title or URL fields.
(Laura)The application should be able to keep count of the total number of links currently on the page.
(*)The application should be able to keep count of the total number of read and unread links currently on the page.
Phase Four: The Project Strikes Back
Add a “Clear Read Bookmarks” button which clears all the read bookmarks when clicked.
The user should not to be able to add a URL that isn’t valid.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##To Laura Turk
Laura Turk and I paired on the Link List project.  Working with Laura was great! We got together and laid a solid foundation utilizing the DTR memo. We each communicated our expectations, areas where we wanted to grow, and how we wanted to execute this project together.  

Laura is a true professional and a great communicator.  She’s open to hearing new ideas and willing to step outside the box and implement them. Laura wasn’t afraid to tackle the  parts of the project that were new to her, she jumped in and drilled into every aspect of the project.  

I really appreciated having the opportunity to pair with her.  I think she is going to be a fantastic web developer.

##To Nik Bornemeier
Nik, I am so happy to have met you!  You are a very kind person who is always willing to help.  Although, we never paired on a project, we have paired during exercises in class and I have often asked you for help with tasks while we were learning different aspects of front end development and you offered very constructive help.  I say continue on on this journey, as web development definitely has a place for you in it.

##To Karen Kepner
Karen you are a great designer, I really like the way you plan out your comps before executing them and I see the difference that extra step makes in the final outcome of the project, a world of difference!  We were never paired together on a project but we have collaborated on in class assignments and thank you for helping me figure some tasks out.

### Being a Community Member
I've attended a student led spike in addition to a guest speaker spike every Friday.

##From Laura Turk
Kristi, working with you on Linked List was a wonderful learning experience and a pleasure. While it was more challenging to pair on a project at Turing than I anticipated -the time pressure, the difficulty of dividing tasks on a project of this size, and my general trepidatious understanding of the material- working with you made a difficult thing inherently less challenging.

Our greatest strength as a team was your proactive approach to communication. I appreciated that you kept the lines of communication open, that you reached out for us to work together, jumped to get us very necessary help, and tried new ways to communicate! I also appreciated your patience with my ‘throw it at the wall and see what sticks’ method of doing css. While it may have (ha! definitely) slowed us down, it was a useful learning experience for me to be more measured and thoughtful in my approach.

I am drawing a blank on any feedback I could give you to improve future partnerships. The only thing would be that we could have both benefited from increased optimization of the git and github workflow, and again, your patience as we figured out how to use that tool was incredible.

Thank you and I hope to work with you again soon!

##From Karen Kepner
How was it working with Kristi? *
Great!  Kristi is friendly and very easy to work with.
Any recommendations for Kristi
Keep getting better everyday.


##From Nik Bornemeier
How was it working with Kristi?

Great. We didn't work together on a project, but I sat next to Kristi during class and we solved many problems together.
Great! Kristi is friendly and very easy to work with.

Any recommendations for Kristi

Keep on working hard!
Keep getting better everyday.

### Playing a Part

(I attended various student led spikes and guest speaker spikes.  I tried to participate with lunch roulette. I was always the one initiating getting together but many didn't respond.)
