# Kelly Miller - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
 1. Become more comfortable working with objects and array prototypes. Get familiar with react.
 2. Ask questions/ask for help when I need it and work on communication while pairing.

## A: End of Module Assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects went really well this mod. It was wonderful getting to collaborate with many members from my cohort. 

#### Sorting Suite

*   [](https://github.com/kellymiller6/sorting-suite)
*   [](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

This project was an introduction to three different sorting algorithms. The three I completed are bubble sort, 
insertion sort, and merge sort.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### CompleteMe

*   [](https://github.com/kellymiller6/completeMe)
*   [](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Create an auto complete using a prefix trie.


# Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me

# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.25:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects taught me a lot about myself and were overall a good experience.
I thought this mod my group projects went smoother than last mod. I was better able to navigate and communicate with 
my partners.


#### game-time

Create a game using html5Canvas and object oriented programming in javascript.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

- from a high level the objects where structured well.
  - I liked the helper functions
- Tests could be more verbose
- UI is a little sparce
- Would like more lanes?

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 2.5 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints
 

#### Weathrly

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kellymiller6/weathrly)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Create a weather app using react, making an api call from weather underground.
# Instructor Evaluation Points: weathrly

# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.


## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

3 - Five or fewer complaints

2 - Six to ten complaints

1 - More than ten complaints

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

See Keji. 

### Being a Community Member

From Keji Amos:
I appreciated that we had similar backgrounds, coming from education. I think that was very useful in allowing us to work well 
together. You're organized, a good planner, and you're a quick study.

From Mentor: 
I have enjoyed working with Kelly on small problems and the occasionally project. She is enthusiastic about working on the 
fundamentals of javascript. We are working on her being more comfortable communicating her thought process as she works. 

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Once I became a little more comfortable in the community I made efforts especially during retros and other cohort specific
times to become an active participant in the community. In addition I participated in a couple of pairings and joined the
Pahlka spikes most weeks. I really enjoyed being a member of ironFe this mod and hope to contribute more in the future.
