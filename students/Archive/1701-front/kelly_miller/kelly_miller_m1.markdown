## B: Individual Work & Projects

Working individually on the first project was a challenge but a welcomed one. 
It was a good experience being responsible for the entire project.

#### Numberguesser

*   [](https://github.com/kellymiller6/numberguessergame)
*   [](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number guesser game where the user inputs a number between 1-100. The game alerts the user if their guess
is too high or too low and when they get it right. The game then generates a new random number to guess. 

UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects taught me a lot about myself and were overall a good experience.
My first group project, Linked List, I felt like I was unable to contribute as much to the javascript as I would have liked.
This motivated me to really push myself in javascript and become much more confident in manipulating the dom.
In my last two projects I realized I am not as good at navigating as I need/want to be so this has become my main
goal for mod 2. 

#### Linked List

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kamos1/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A webpage where you add and save a URL and a URL title into two inputs. You click on submit to save the bookmark to your webpage.

Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Use back ticks in prepend statement. 
Look for opportunities to refactor javascript.

#### IdeaBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karenkepner/idea-box)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

A webpage where you add and save an idea title and body into two inputs. You click on submit to save the bookmark to your 
webpage. This webpage uses local storage in order for ideas to persist. Each idea has a quality that changes on an upvote 
or down vote. This change persists on refresh. 

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In this project we took another groups ideabox project, wrote and ran acceptance tests through selenium.
After testing the code was refactored and pivoted from an ideabox to a to-do list application. 
Quality was changed to importance and included five different levels. 
Additional added features include: completed tasks, limiting cards on page to 10 and showing more on button click, 
filtering to-dos by importance level.

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Pay a little more attention to CSS specifics to match the comp.
Refactor javascript to pull out redundant code especially around local storage. 


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Throughout our educational careers we are often taught to believe that we are either good at something or we are not. 
This belief is that of a fixed mindset. If instead we are taught to believe that we are capable of learning anything
we work dilegently at - then it becomes a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy and we can accomplish amazing this. 
This is was we call a growth mindset. During our time at Turing it is important that we watch for times when we fall into
fixed mindset beliefs. Such as I'm just not good at x,y, or z. And have a support system in place to remind us that we 
might not feel we are good at that yet, but with work we can become good at it. 

### Gear Up
#### Getting better at difficult things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

There is a common sequence to becoming good at difficult things. You can visualize it as starting with a bunch of item in
group A (can't do, but need to do), overtime as we gain some skills you start to move items from group A to group B (can do 
with effort), and eventually to group C (mastery). Problems occur when you start to build up skills in groups A and B. One 
way you can move them along is to chunck them out, and move bits and pieces to C as quickly as possible. This really spoke to
me especially at a time when I felt like we were learning many new things at a time and hadn't really been able to move them
from A to B or B to C before we were learning the next thing. 
We also talked about leaning into and embracing the discomfort that comes from learning something new and foreign. 

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

In this professional development we watched a movie on the gender gap in computer programming fields and discussed our
experiences at Turing and ways to improve them. This movie really showed me the roles media and advertising has had on the
field. It was exciting to learn how much women contributed in the early days and discourgaging to know that in the early 
80s the field was almost 50% women. Media played a huge role in making it a 'mens' or 'bros' profession. Forward thinking
bootcamps - such as Turing, and companies like Etsy are making great strides towards leveling the demographics of incoming
developers. Beyond just getting more women started in the field there also need to be improvements in workplace culture and
promotional opportunities to improve retention as well.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

Different ways to pair - driver/navigator, ping pong, remote.
DTR - define the relationship before beginning a project and then return to it throughout. Provides clear expectations from
both parties both in the work that is done, and the hows (scheduling, division of labor, etc). Can be used to clear the air
if there are any conflicts that come up.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Feedback 1

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md)

We all have different defense triggers that can come up while receiving feedback. It is important to understand these triggers
so that we can be open and receptive to feedback. There are different types of feedback, appreciation, coaching and 
evaluation. In this program we will mostly be giving and receiving appreciation and coaching feedback to/from our peers. When
giving feedback, especially if there are any points of contention it is important to plan beforehand when/where we give it
so as to come of non-threatening and also what we want to say/gain from the time. 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

See Keji and Karens. 

### Being a Community Member

From Keji Amos:
I appreciated that we had similar backgrounds, coming from education. I think that was very useful in allowing us to work well 
together. You're organized, a good planner, and you're a quick study.

From Karen Kepner:
Kelly is driven to learn coding. She seeks to understand how the code works after it is finally working. While working as a 
pairing partner she was good about making sure our schedules worked out.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Once I became a little more comfortable in the community I made efforts especially during retros and other cohort specific
times to become an active participant in the community. I attended a couple of lunch roulettes even though mine never worked
out, so that I could get to know those outside our mod. In addition I participated in a couple of pairings and joined the
Pahlka spikes most weeks. This is an area I want to continue to improve in by actively trying to get to know those from other
mods and attending events such as Joan Clarke.
