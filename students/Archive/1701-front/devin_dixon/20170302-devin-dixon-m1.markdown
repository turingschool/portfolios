## B: Individual Work & Projects

  During mod 1, I got to work on two projects individually : Number Guesser & Linked List.

#### Number Guesser

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

There were two projects that I got to pair on in this module : IdeaBox & 2DoBox Pivot.

#### IdeaBox

*   [https://github.com/devthehuman/idea-box](IdeaBox)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html](Original Assignment)

Build a site that stores a user's important ideas, using local storage to have ideas persist on page refresh.

## Evaluator: Robbie

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

##### Feedback from Chris
  * Very knowledgeable concerning all aspects we have touched upon so far this module, can maintain organized, readable code with ease, and quite clever with Javascript/jQuery.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

*   [https://github.com/devthehuman/2dobox-pivot](2DoBox)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html](Original Assignment)

Take an existing IdeaBox repo, refactor the current code as it stands, test that code using Selenium, and add new features to complete.

## Evaluator: Bree

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from phases 1 through 4 that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Feedback from Laura
  * Devin, I cannot overstate how awesome it was for us to have a difficult conversation and have it turn things around so quickly and thoroughly. It is an awesome strength and demonstrates a certain amount of humility and empathy to hear someone out, recognize how your actions might have been perceived despite your intentions, and act on it. Our partnership after that moment was great and you helped restore some of my confidence that had been lagging. I also appreciate how you've stepped up to get our cohort to practice javascript problems! On the more technical side, your javascript skills are killer, and your suggestion to fork the repos of paired projects, push practice to github, and join code wars are totally awesome and appreciated! Keep at it!


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms

The main thing I took away from this session is there are many healthy ways to deal
with stress, and ultimately dealing with stress in unhealthy ways causes more stress.
It was interesting to see how other people handled stressful situations, and how they
choose to vent their emotions without getting overwhelmed by them.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#####Feedback to Laura
 * I thought that our partnership went very well and I can't wait to work with you on other projects! You're very receptive to new ideas and made me feel at ease about the deadline. You weren't afraid to assert yourself which is so important and such a great quality to have. You work hard and want to make sure that the people you're around feel included and appreciated, and it shows!

### Being a Community Member

#####Feedback from John
 * I really appreciated it when you spoke up the other week about how repeating isn't something to be ashamed of. You seem to have good insight when you speak up, so if you feel like you have something that the rest of us should know, don't be afraid to tell us.

### Playing a Part

Attending iron-fe, lunch roulettes, and offering my help whenever someone needed it.
