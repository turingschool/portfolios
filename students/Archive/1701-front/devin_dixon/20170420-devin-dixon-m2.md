## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

  During mod 2, I got to work on two projects individually : Sorting Suite & Complete Me.

#### Number Guesser

*   [https://github.com/devthehuman/sorting-sweet](Sorting Suite)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html](Original Assignment)

Write out three algorithms for sorting: Bubble, Insert and Merge.

## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Complete Me

*   [https://github.com/devthehuman/complete-me](Complete Me)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html](Original Assignment)

Build a simple autocomplete system using a prefix tree.

## Evaluator: Jhun

# Comments:

- loved the cache'ing of the word! so good!
- great job testing I would love to see some automation.

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were two projects that I got to pair on in this module : Game-Time & Weathrly.

#### Game-Time

*   [https://github.com/devthehuman/frogger-gametime](Game-Time)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html](Original Assignment)

Build a game using HTML5 canvas, javascript, and unit testing.

## Evaluator: Jhun

# Comments:
- great OO design
  - would like to see another super class or just have frog, h20, and lilypad inherit from.

- Test were solid.
  - would like to see more tests around the collision.

- Great job making the collision agnostic.

- Only glaring thing is the index.js

## Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

*   [https://github.com/kellymiller6/weathrly](Weathrly)
*   [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html](Original Assignment)

Build a weather app using the WeatherUnderground API, React, Enzyme, Jest, and Sinon.

## Evaluator: Jhun

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* I found this gear up to be particularly interesting because I hadn't really thought about the future of automation before. I was amazed at how far technology has progressed in terms of automation and thought it was really neat just how many jobs could be automated. It sparked an awesome discussion on the pros and cons of it all and it was great to hear people's opinions on the subject.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#####Feedback to Mike
 * I think it's incredible impressive and something to admire how much work you put into your craft. The hours you put in and the standards you set for yourself really convey just how much being a great programmer means to you. I find myself always looking up to you as a role model and as a motivator to do better and be better. It's been awesome getting to hang with you since we started out in mod 1 and I can't wait to see what you accomplish post-Turing. You da man!

### Being a Community Member

#####Feedback from Mike
 * As before, your ability to learn and pick things up. I can tell from your attendance at Iron FE how quickly you can pick up the trickier parts of JS. The proof is how you've picked up Regex. I don't know many people that can write Regex with docs, but you can. Keep this momentum going, embrace React and Redux and sail through Mod 3!

### Playing a Part

Attending/running IronFE and offering my help whenever someone needed it.
