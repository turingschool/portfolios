## Module 4 - 1701FE

**Areas of Emphasis**
* I set out to crush it!

**Rubric Scores**
* End-of-Module Assessment: 3. I felt like I got a pretty decent product up and 
running in the time allotted, but would have liked to have styled the site better and 
fixed a few of the UI bugs. Overall, I thought it went well.

* Individual Work & Projects: 3ish. There were a lot of assignments given to us this mod
and I definitely could've done better on some of them. This mod was a grind and I let that
affect the quality of my work in certain areas.

* Group Work & Projects: 3.5. I feel like I did my part in each of the group projects, and
everyone I got the chance to work with was great. We produced some pretty great final products
and I'm happy with the outcome of each project.

* Professional Development: 3. I have a few interviews lined up in the first few weeks post-Turing,
so I think it went well.

* Feedback & Community Participation: 3.

**Individual Assessment:** - Pass

**Required Projects**
* [Jet Fuel](https://github.com/devthehuman/jet-fuel): 110/150

* [Capstone](https://github.com/devthehuman/etude-part-deux): Pass

**Community**
* Summary of how you've contributed to the community
  * This mod I had the pleasure of pairing with a lot of my fellow cohort-mates and with some people in lower
  mods and being able to help them through a problem was immensely satisfying. I also moderated IronFE from behind the
  scenes during this inning. I set up the repo to hold all the challenges from each day, coordinated who took each day,
  and set up a private channel for the hosts to communicate.
  
* A recap of reflections from Gear Up
  * I had a great time leading a Gear Up this inning. It was great to see how engaged people got in the conversations
  surrounding our topic (code-schools) and I enjoyed hearing everyone's stories about how they arrived at the decision
  to come to Turing. We got pretty much all good reviews from the students who attended our session and the whole experience
  gave me a lot of insight into how instructors decide on and run Gear Ups.
