## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Shindig

* [Github](https://github.com/devthehuman/shindig)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Scores](https://gist.github.com/devthehuman/d5effada1a75bdc81300b601574e2494)

I wanted to build an app that allows users to track concerts in any given city across the user, add an event to a calendar
in their account, and then be able to communicate with other users who are attending the same shows. To accomplish this, I
utilized the Express boilerplate, React, Redux, Router, Knex, Jest and Enzyme.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built three projects as a pair/group during this mod: Headcount, SWapibox, and Movie-Tracker

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub](https://github.com/kamos1/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* [Scores](https://gist.github.com/devthehuman/ef9f9ddcbab8bdb49aa014fc5e1b172a)

HeadCount 2.0 was an app to test our ability to manipulate data from an API. It was definitely a challenge figuring out how to 
render the correct data where we wanted to render it. It was built using the create-react-app boilerplate.

#### SWapi Box

* [GitHub](https://github.com/DBULL7/SWapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [Scores](https://gist.github.com/devthehuman/aeb42078083db2f0db2d14c04ad7610c)


This project was definitely the hardest out of all the projects this mod. Making nested api calls and rendering data based
on certain conditions was extremely challenging and it pushed me quite a bit. I took a lot of knowledge away from that and
grew as a developer because of that. 

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/devthehuman/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Scores](https://gist.github.com/devthehuman/7c8ddb515b9f1d72d685663e9957f53f)

Movie Tracker was the first project in which we got to use React Redux and React Router, as well as work with a backend built
out by Taylor. It was a lot to take in and absorb, but I learned so much from struggling through the project. Also, working with an actual team of devs instead of just pairing was an awesome experience. It gave me a peek into what my actual job will be like.

## D: Professional Skills
During this mod I got to put together a pretty decent resume, track jobs using Trello (which I had never used before), 
actually spent time really thinking about what I want out of a job (flower exercise), and did a bit of cold outreach.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons
I thought the site presented to us in this gear up was really well done and illustrated their point well. I didn't realize that even the smallest biases and prejudices could have such a large effect on society as a whole. And what I really took away from that is that once these things are in place, it doesn't just take neutrality to remove them, but active counter efforts.

#### MicroAggressions
This is something that I think about quite often and it was cool to have a gear up on the subject. I try to observe, as much as I can, the subtleties in people's interactions and the way they reveal how they feel about things. This doesn't come from a judgmental place at all, more for my own personal understanding. I think people in tech definitely experience these things and it's important to be aware of how our interactions may cause someone to feel uncomfortable.

#### Snowden Leaks
This topic brings up so many good points from all sides, it's hard to know where I stand. On the one side, it feels like he's a hero for leaking what he did, and I'd like to think I'd do the same. On the other side, people brought up that he could have handled it a bit better and maybe not have leaked the info in China. I think this is a sensitive topic because we as citizens didn't want to admit that maybe our government was spying on us or collecting our data. Even with all the things that have changed because of his actions, I know it's not over yet and I'll be paying more attention now so I can observe how it unfolds.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I ran IronFe on Wednesday mornings this module, and did my best to be available for screenhero pairing or in person help
whenever anybody needed it. 

## F: Feedback
* Feedback from Keji: No more getting sick, but seriously it was good working with you. You’re very clever and a good communicator.  Something to keep in mind for next time we work together, I’m not a rapper.
* Feedback from Devon: Devin has grit, is highly motived to write good Javascript, and is easy to communicate with.
* Feedback from Leta: Devin really carried Movie Tracker. He wrote our reducers and actions and got us launched into Redux. It was great having him on the team and I think we all gelled well!
