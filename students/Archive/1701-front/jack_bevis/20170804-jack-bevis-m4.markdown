# Jack Bevis - M4 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering

### Area of Emphasis

My goals coming into Mod 4 were to really solidify my understanding of front end engineering as well as gain a strong understanding of building out backend progams using Node. Additionally, my goal was to ramp up the job hunt, but felt that by the end of week two that I really needed to focus on finishing the program strong. I felt that I wouldn't be able to put my best work forward if I was too preoccupied with the job hunt. I committed to this program, and I fully intended to finish it strong. I feel I was able to accomplish these goals in a relative way. I definitely feel confident in my use of Express, Knex and postgreSQL in building out a database and server. However, I feel that what mod 4 also did was reiterate that there is still a lot that I need to revisit and solidify to feel truly confident in a technical interview. This is specifically in regard to a lot of our interview jeopardy questions. Overall though, I feel that I accomplished my goals for mod 4.

### Instructor Feedback: PASS

## Community Participation

This module I was very excited to take on a leadership role in running the morning JavaScript review group Iron-FE. Iron-FE is a group that I've been participating in since mod 1 and I know how much I benefitted and learned from attending, especially in mod 2. As such, I was very exciting to take ownership of the group in a way and give back to the lower mods in a way, that I hope, was similar to all the help I received from 1608, 1610 and 1611. In leading the group, I also feel that my understanding of some fundamental JS aspects were solidified in my own mind, and I grew more comfortable teaching and public speaking. In addition to Iron-FE, I wrote my first blog post about contributing to open source code. While I know this was a requirement for a project, I found the process to be very encouraging, and I plan to write more in the weeks to come as a way of giving more to tech community as a whole. Finally, I was able to give back to the Turing community through the revamped posse structure. I was necessarily an official posse lead for Hamilton Posse, but I do feel that I moved into a kind of psuedo-mentor role for the members in the lower mods. I felt I was able to help them all through pairing and general talks about how to balance the demands of Turing.

## Gear Up Reflection

I helped lead the Gear Up focusing on the role of coding schools vs traditional education, where coding schools are headed as an institution as a whole, and how Turing is preparing students for lives as developers. I was drawn to this topic because of my own process in deciding to come to Turing versus pursuing a masters degree in a related field, and how places like Turing are having an impact on higher education. Preparing for the Gear Up went very well, the group (all 1701-FE peeps) worked very well together in researching topics and bringing thougtful insight to our subjects and good questions to ask the group. What I really enjoyed from the mod4 Gear Up I attended when I was in Mod3 was how the leaders asked great follow up questions that really drove and stimulated thoughtful conversation. I tried to bring some of this to our group. I found that in most cases I was playing the devil's advocate on a lot of our discussion topics in order to try to drive a better conversation. Overall, I found the whole experience to very rewarding and I got the sense that the majority of people that attended found the topic and discussion worth while.

## Feedback

### Receiving:

* "Working with Jack has been a good time. He communicates well and has a good attitude when it comes to tackling unexpected issues which makes project enjoyable. Other then that heâ€™s boring af and likes to warm up with jep for wheel which is obnoxious." - Dave Hubertus (Capstone partner).

* Feedback from Gear Up:
- "I thought the session went great. The Mod 4 students were able to slightly change the format of the session on the fly in order to adapt to the direction the conversation was taking, which was great." 
- "The Mod 4 people who led our gear up were absolutely awesome.  They put thought into our topics, and they asked really great questions and led great discussions."
- "Each Mod-4 leader had a topic to introduce and pose three discussion points. The topics were engaging, but the introductions were repetitive and somewhat convoluted. Also, the topics were relatable enough to the whole group that the conversation was good, and sustained, however not enough time was allotted to discuss each topic."

### Giving:

* "Working with Dave was great. Our goals and work styles gel very well, and from that we are able to communicate very effectively and get things done. Our combined love of Jeopardy only made working on Capstone all the more enjoyable. I totally think we should be able to do technical interviews as a team, it would be hilarious."
