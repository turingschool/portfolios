# Jack Bevis - M3 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering

Coming into Mod 3, my goals were primarily to solidify my understanding of React while also improving my testing capabilities. I also wanted to absorb as much new information as possible, and get workflow speed and level to that of a junior developer. Finally, I was excited for the personal project and the opportunity is work in and explore new libraries / frameworks.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Get Out There
# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.


### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Below is a recap of my paired projects and scores from Mod 3.

#### Headcount 2.0

*  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/headcount-2.0)
*  [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Students: Jack & Dave
## Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
## Notes:

## Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design
- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

## Testing
- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## Students: Leta & Jack
## Evaluator: Taylor
## Notes: Great project, break out helper functions to there own file. Try to break logic from the return. Also take out redundant code

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

4 - Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

## Students: Jack, Adam, Breanna
## Evaluator: Meeka
## Notes:

### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture

Shouldn't have functions live in actions that don't need to be there.

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

Score could be ammended but recommendation was to focus on good refactoring and unit testing in personal project instead.

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

* 3: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.


## D: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Dave Hubertus (Headcount 2.0):
  Working with you on Headcount went really well. We have a pretty strong rapport to begin with and brought the same attitude to the project. As such we were able to accomplish the goals for the project, and burn through some tough challenges in order to do so. I also want to say thanks again for shouldering a brunt of the project over the weekend while I was out of town. That was not ideal, but we were able to get it done. Great pairing, and looking forward to more collaboration.

##### To Leta Keane (partner for SWAPI-Box):
  Working with you on Swapi-Box was a very good pairing. As was most of the work for this mod, we had to tackle some pretty tricky concepts in relatively short period of time. Although the testing was a beast of a challenge, I’m proud that we were able to get the project finished in its entirety, did someone say grit? At times I felt we both had a tendency to internalize our thoughts, which made it difficult to know where we were on how to tackle a particular problem. Overall, great working with you, and hope we pair again in the future.

##### To Adam Carpenter (partner for MovieTracker ):
  Working with you on Movie Tracker I felt went very well. It was a challenging project for too many reasons, but I felt we both did a great job of trying to pick up Redux and pull each other along to get the project done. Also, huge ups for staying late on a Friday so we could get the mvp essentially done. I think there were some communication challenges that stemmed from a 3 person project, but overall nothing we couldn’t get through. Overall a great pairing

##### To John Binning (partner for UX/UI Challenge ):
  Right off the bat, the success of Mass Cultiv8r would not have happened without you. Working with you on the UX/UI was great. We brought the same sense of humor to the project, while also maintaining the work ethic to get it done well. Also, pairing on general class assignments was great, you provided me with a lot of help and insight and I appreciate that. Hope we get a chance to work together again.

#### Receiving Feedback

  I appreciated your dedication. The long evenings were a grind, man. But having to wrestle with testing for SWAPIbox was at least bearable working with you :) - Leta Keane

  Working on redux/router project with Jack was really productive and was a great partnering. We were able to crack tough problems together and the work ethic was similar so we were able to get a lot of work done. Jack, didn't bring any dinner for the group while we were working on the project, but I can let that slide. Solid work ethic, grasp of JS/React and great teamworking skills. - Adam Carpenter

  Working on headcount was as smooth as pairing as I have had to date. Communication was strong which allowed us to attack issues efficiently. We could have improved handling our stress levels when crunch time brolled around but overall teamwork and brollaboration was strong. - Dave Hubertus

### Gear Up

#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

  I found the Parable of the Polygons to be an extremely effective visual representation of how diversity is hampered in society by implicit biases. While we can hope for a world where one day we won't have to think about the issue, we're not there yet. As such it is incumbent upon all of us to actively seek out people with lived experiences that differ from our own. Doing this allows for an increased perspective on the world and will promote an increased exchange of ideas. The smallest biases can have huge impacts, be aware, and be willing to act to make change.

#### (MicroAggresions)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

  My takeaways from this session included being aware of how stereotypes are being perpetuated in professional settings via microaggressions. It's important to be aware that even the smallest, seemingly harmless comment can have seriously negative connotations attached. It's important to meet people on an even level, and not presume to know their story. Have a conversation and learn.

#### (Universal Basic Income I)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

  The issue of Universal Basic Income is woefully complicated, philosophically speaking, from a policy standpoint, to implementation. I found it interesting that at the beginning of the session, many people moved to the extremes of the spectrum, either very pro, or very con. By the end of the discussion it seemed that most people had moved to the middle due to the fact that there is no easy solution. The general takeaway is that UBI is inevitable, because automation is increasing at such a drastic rate. I feel that the UBI conversation is premature until the issue of Automation is fully understood. I still found the discussion to be engaging, and the mod 4 peeps did a great job facilitating that.


### Playing a Part

  Honestly, my community participation took a bit of a hit this inning. I contributed to the Pahlka Posse project Food4All during the first half of the inning, but that took a back seat as I fell behind on Movie Tracker and the Personal Project. I plan on resetting and taking a more active role in Mod 4. Iron-FE also tapered off a little this inning, which I find to be a bit of shame. It was difficult to engage on  a daily basis, as a lot of us and mod 4 students were buried in work. I would like to get a group of us from 1701 to get on the same page and kick start it again next inning. My thought is to do a lot of outreach to 1705. Getting mod 2 and maybe even mod 1 in the latter half would be key. I think it's difficult for mod 3 students to find the time with the work load.
