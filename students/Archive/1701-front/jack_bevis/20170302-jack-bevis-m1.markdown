# Jack Bevis - M1 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering

I decided to come to Turing because I wanted to gain a valuable new skill set and attempt to gain a career in front-end development. Prior to arriving at Turing I had some limited professional work in HTML, and had done some self teaching in CSS and Javascript, but very limited. My goals for this mod were to really improve fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as start to develop better design principles. The end goal being to establish a strong base for beginning pursuing a career in front end development.

### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box allows users to keep track of all their "great" ideas. Users can enter the name and description of their idea, and upon submitting will create a new card of that idea. The idea is also stored in local storage so it can be referenced after refreshing the page. Users can rate their ideas, and delete them from the DOM and local storage.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

### 2Do-Box-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In 2Do-Box-Pivot we took an unfamiliar code base for Idea Box, and refactored the code into a 2Do Box. In 2Do Box the user can list out all the things they need to do. Tasks can be rated by level of priority and categorized as complete or incomplete. We also created a working Selenium testing suite for the code base prior to refactoring.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

#### Specification Adherence

  3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

  I found this Gear Up session to be very helpful. I think for awhile before coming to Turing, I was very much stuck in a fixed mindset. I had been stuck in a job I didn't enjoy, and some other failures really had me thinking that maybe I wasn't capable of changing my direction in life. Carol Dweck's TED talk that we watched and the following discussion really helped me realize the importance of maintaining a growth mindset.

#### Managing Stress

* [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

  This session was helpful in that it allowed me to take some personal reflection time to really address what has caused me stress in the past, and how I managed it. This was also a chance for me to reset at right about the mid mod point. From here I recognized what stress management tactics work best for me, and how to use those through the remaining three weeks of the mod.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender

* [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

  I found the documentary to be very interesting and resonating. What I came away with after the film is that myself, as a white, straight, male I kind of fit into the mold of who's expected to be seen in the tech industry. As such, I have a responsibility to stay aware of how my peers are experiencing it differently. Be an ally and advocate for female peers, and have the courage to say something something is happening. The airbag development piece was also startling to me. I had not known that something so prevalent in today's society was developed and tested without considering the specifications of more than half of the population.

### PROtocol
#### Learning to Pair

* [DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pu8PdqdM_7Aavzm7C37_1E9PP5is8Qz4tPJpMHnbpmg/edit)

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Identity Essentials

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/professional_development/module_one/identity_essentials.markdown)

  For our professional development we were asked to establish our online profiles across a series of professional sites.

Professional Links:
* [GitHub](https://github.com/jbevis)
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-bevis-884073138/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-bevis-884073138/)

My takeaways from the session were the importance of establishing a clear, concise online presence in the tech world.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Devon Bull (partner on Linked List):
  "Working with Devon on the Linked List was a very productive experience. We both brought a similar attitude to the project and set our expectations on how to complete it. My only suggestion to him is to remember to keep the project as a whole in mind, not just one aspect."

##### To Travis Gregory (partner for Idea Box):
  "Working with Travis was the best pairing experience I had during the inning. We were able to establish a good working relationship from the get go, and how our personal schedules would work for the project. I think we were able to communicate very effectively throughout the project and thus were successful in reaching our goals. Outside of the project, working with Travis is very helpful and beneficial. He’s able to articulate his thoughts well and explain problems and help you work through it."

##### To Amanda Chavez (partner for 2Do-Box-Pivot):
  "Amanda was a great partner to pair with for the 2Do-Box-Pivot. We had a lot of rewarding successes on the project as well as some serious roadblocks. She was great at keeping things in perspective and advocating for breaks so we could clear our heads and come back to it later, refreshed and energized."

### Being a Community Member

#### Receiving Feedback

  "Dude working with you was great,  we were on the same page and able to help each other through the rough parts using driver/navigator. Your ability to reason through things and explain them is invaluable. I started that project with no idea how we would make it work and by the end was really proud of what we made." - Devon Bull

  "You understanding and explanations of Javascript, especially testing has been very helpful, not only were you able to inform and point me in the right direction but also not give the answer up without letting me think through the question. This same approach with other students has been very beneficial. And you are drummer and thats dope. Rhythm sections are king!" - Adam Carpenter

  "Thanks for the great pairing experience. I felt like we meshed really well and it seemed like you and I have similar home situations which made it easy for us to come up with an action plan for our project that worked for both of us. Other than the stress of some coding hurdles our project felt seamless. In the future I would recommend just getting up and walking away from the project when you get stuck. It can be easy to sit in front of difficult tasks and grind through them but getting away for a few minutes is always helpful. Thanks for the great experience and I look forward to working on projects with you in the future!" - Travis Gregory

  "You were a great partner to have on the To-Do project. It was really tough, and we had to adjust our thinking, but we finished! There were some moments of frustration, but you gave our project urgency and I could see how much you cared about getting things done - and done well. I'm confident you'll be awesome when it comes to writing with the best practices because you already have that mindset. It was also very helpful to talk through every aspect of the code, even though we'd been over it thousands of times." - Amanda Chavez


### Playing a Part

This mod my focus was to get acclimated to the Turing environment and get a sense of what the work load and stress level would be. I attended the Friday speaker series this mod, and really enjoyed them as a whole. Scott Davies in particular was a really great talk. I also attended a few Iron-FE sessions in the morning, and hope to be a more regular attendee next inning. I also plan on joining a posse next mod, I'm thinking the Pahlka Posse as I'd love to get more involved in Civic Tech. I'd like to find a topic for lightning talk as well.
