# Jack Bevis - M2 Portfolio

## Front-End Engineering

My goals for mod 2 were to really build a better foundation of fundamental javascript skills, and set myself up for success in Mod 3 in using different frameworks and libraries.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Complete Me

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Below is a recap of my paired projects and scores from Mod 2.

#### Game Time

*  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

- Game is functional.

- Would like to see more integration tests ( tests that communicate what is actually going on. Not just pulse checks but you replicating situations in the game and asserting you are getting the output you want.)
  - loved the one test that was automated.

- Game knows too much
  - Should probably move collision detection to the ball (for its collisions), and move to board (detecting sides and so forth)
  - If that doesn't make sense you could theoretically move all the collisions to another class to handle the specific collisions like to happen. ( I think the prior suggestion is better...)


## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbevis/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

# Instructor Evaluation Points: weathrly
# Instructor: Nathaniel Foster
# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

## HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript / React Style

3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

## Testing
// jest test
2.5 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints


## D: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Keji Amos (general pairing):
  You were a great person to pair with and white board with. We worked together a lot at Iron-FE, which was incredibly valuable. I also really appreciate all the help you gave me on sorting-suite, especially white boarding out the merge sort at least 10 times to be sure we understood what was going on.

##### To Justyna Field (partner for Weatherly):
  Working with you was really enjoyable. Weatherly was by far the hardest thing we've been asked to tackle at Turing thus far, in my opinion. You maintained a very cool head throughout the whole project, and we're really good at keeping us on track when we were about to go down the rabbit-hole. It was really rewarding to finally get components to render on the page. I hope we get to work together again in the future.

##### To Jenn Peavler(partner for Game Time ):
  Working with you on Game Time went really well. You came into the project with a lot of energy and it was nice to be able to hit the ground running. We had to pivot the project a few times, and you were super adaptable, which made the abrupt change not that challenging. You're also a very competent coder. Overall, solid experience.

#### Receiving Feedback

  You were great at communicating what you needed and what you were thinking throughout the protect. You were hard-working. Great at adapting in an unusual jury situation and stepping up for the eval. Thanks! Great working with ya. - Jenn Peavler

  Jack, you were the best. First of all, it was really nice of you to not give me all the answers upfront. Making me work from them was extremely valuable for me to understand core concepts. Its also important to note that you have excellent intuition of deciding whether the answer would help me or not. In some cases I found, it helped to give me the answer to analyze and understand. You were able to figure out if that was more helpful than not. Thank you again. We'll definitely pair again in the future. - Evan Miller (1703-FE)

  It was great working with Jack. I appreciate how we approached the new subject and patiently worked through challenges together. I like how we discussed code problems and tried new solutions. I feel like we’ve learnt a lot while working together. Jack was very dependable and respectful. I would like to work with Jack again in the future. - Justyna Field


### Playing a Part

My goal this mod was to start playing a bigger part in the Turing community as a whole. I attended Iron-FE almost every morning this inning which I found was very crucial developing my white boarding and my familiarity with manipulating arrays and objects in javascript. I also joined Pahlka Posse at the beginning of the inning. I helped to plan the posse's 'hack-sessibility-athon' spike for week 4. I'm looking forward to further involvement in the coming mods.
