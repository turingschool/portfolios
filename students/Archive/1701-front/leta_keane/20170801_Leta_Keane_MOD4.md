### Module 4 (Front-end)

* **Areas of Emphasis** - I wanted to just learn a lot of new stuff, and not stress too much about mastering every aspect of them.
* **Rubric scores** - Fill in how YOU would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:
  * End-of-Module Assessment: 3.5; it worked well - it was just kind of ugly. I sometimes open the app and enjoy my own hilarity. Barry is the best shark.
  * Individual Work & Projects: 3; This mod did not contain my best individual work, but I think it was solidly Acceptable.
  * Group Work & Projects: 3.5; I like working in groups. I thought I didn't, but it turns out I do. It's so much nicer debugging with multiple pairs of eyes on the problem.
  * Professional Development: 3.5
  * Feedback & Community Participation: 4; See below.
  
* **Individual Assessment:** - (Pass)
* **Required Projects**
    * [Capstone Project](https://github.com/letakeane/mentr): Pass
    * [House of Vars (blog post)](https://medium.com/@letakeane/contributing-to-open-source-the-sharks-are-photoshopped-47e22db1ab86)
    * [Jet Fuel](https://github.com/JohnBinning/jetFuel): 130/150
    * [BYOB](https://github.com/letakeane/faceEmotionAPI): 128/150
    
* **Community**
  * Summary of how you've contributed to the community
    * I took a lead in Iron-FE, my posse, and organizing the be-fe-crosspolinate channel/group.
    * I've been pairing with mods 2 and 3, both formally and informally (dropping by the classrooms).
  * A recap of reflections from Gear Up
    * It was nice to work with Laura, Stephanie, Jonathan, and Nick - everyone was interested, everyone was happy to jump in, everyone pulled their weight. Our group was engaged and seemed to find the lesson takeaways useful.
    * I still feel very strongly about the importance of nonverbal communication. Something Robbie wouldn't understand since he talks very loudly all the time.
