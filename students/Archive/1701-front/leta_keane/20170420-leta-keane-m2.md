# Leta Keane - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Mod 2 were:
*  To strengthen algorithmic thinking
*  To get started in React
*  To make it to Mod 3
*  To develop a better idea of the kind of job I want

## Rubric Scores - self evaluation

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: X
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3.5

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Weathrly:

## Evaluator: Jhun

### Spec Adherence: 3

### User Interface: 3.5

### HTML Style: 3

### CSS: 3.5

### JS/React style: 3

### Testing: 2 (pending a 3)


# Assessment: PENDING

## Evaluator: Jhun

## Optional Notes:

* Mixing up the parameter object and the instance of the object (this.name vs. options.name)
* More practice with array prototypes

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Solo projects!

### Sorting Suite

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/lk-sorting-suite)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

I LOVED Sorting Suite. Whiteboarding with everyone, the almost daily "a ha!" moments. It was fun.

#### Evaluator: Jhun

#### Notes:

*  Tests were A1 only issue was the helper functions
*  bubble wasn't super efficient
*  loved the destructuring

#### Fundamental Javascript & Style

- 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints



-------------
### CompleteMe

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/CompleteMe)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

I super enjoyed CompleteMe, too - for pretty much the same reasons as Sorting Suite.

#### Evaluator: Nathaniel

#### Notes:

#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


----------------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### GameTime

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/lk-sh-gametime)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Back in the far off mists of history, we had a project called Game Time. Spencer and I were paired up again (dream teammmmm), and we struggled spectacularly. I wasn't sure we were going to pull off the project, but eventually we did, with weird bugs that made our snake flash different colors, but that's TOTALLY a feature. Totally.

## Evaluator: Nathaniel

##33 Functional Expectations

3.5
Snake game is fully playable and speeds up when you eat more apples

##3# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
instructions, new game, high scores...

##3# Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#3 ## JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##3# Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#3 ## Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

From me to Christie Lynam:
Thank you Christie! It was a blast working with you, too - it was clear you had a good handle on JavaScript and single responsibility programming. You asked great questions and helped me learn, too. You're going to crush it in mod 2!

From me to Bucket:
I was impressed by your determination to see the project through, and your patience in dealing with my frantic steamrolling. You continued to work hard despite feeling super lousy, and kept showing up, which I really appreciated.




### Being a Community Member

From Christie Lynam to me:
Pairing with you for number guesser was a great experience. It was my first pairing at Turing. You were super helpful in explaining some of the foundational concepts I was trying to wrap my head around in those first few weeks. I really appreciated you asking someone else from your cohort to help us when we having trouble figuring something out. Thank you again!! Good luck in mod 3!!

From Bucket to me:
You have the virtue some would refer to as patience. As a project partner, you held up your own and then some. You not held up your end of the fair responsibility, but you took a large bit of mine also. You were understanding of my ‘condition’ and were willing to help out. I appreciated that very much.


### Playing a Part

Anders and I headed up a D3 study group and will continue that into Mod 3.

I have also been active in Try Turing events as a TA and speaking on the Q&A panel.

I joined Hamilton posse and teamed up with some Mod2BE-ers to build a Wellness Tracker app.

This Thursday, I'm participating in Demo Night, showing my prefix trie.

## Final Review
