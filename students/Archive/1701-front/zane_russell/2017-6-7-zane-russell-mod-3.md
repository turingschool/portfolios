## B: Individual Work & Projects

### On Tour

[On Tour Github](https://github.com/zanedr/On-Tour)

[Original Concept Deliverable](https://github.com/zanedr/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1701/mod-3/self-directed/zane-russell/1-checkin.md)

Work in progress. On Tour is an aid for musicians planning tours. Built with React and Redux, On Tour projects total travel cost based on current, location-specific gas prices, MPG, and distance between locations.  Users will be able to print a map and iteneray, as well as save their work and reload it later.

API calls, including locations, distances, and current gas prices are working and successfuly integrated into all calulations for cost and distance.
Need to finish graphic map locations and routes, printing, and saving.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Movie Tracker

[Completed Movie Tracker](https://github.com/DBULL7/movie_tracker)

[Original Movie Tracker assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Group project that required Redux and React Router in addition to React.  Utilized a commercial API to create a robust character building experience.

### SWAPI-box

[Compeleted SWAPI-box](https://github.com/anderswood/SWAPIbox)

[Original SWAPI-box assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Group project that introduced API calls for the first time. The API itself was pretty janky, so it became an introduction to in-depth data scrubbing as well.

### HeadCount 2.0

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### For Chris Jordan:
Chris is an incredibly creative and capable programmer, and the project went out without a hitch.  He’s a laid back and intelligent fella, which make communication and pairing easy. Anytime I was at a loss for how to approach a problem he would deliver a solution that worked pretty much flawlessly. Pretty sure it’s voodoo.  Would definitely pair again.

### Being a Community Member

##### From Chris Jordan
Zane was a awesome partner to have. If there were things I was lacking, Zane was the answer. Willing to burn the midnight oil and be able to work well on a group project side by side or remotely. Very creative when it comes to css and a strong grasp of react and api calls. Would work with this fella again

very patient and very capable
