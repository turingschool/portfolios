## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Dog Party
[https://github.com/zanedr/dogparty](Completed Dog Party)

Sometimes there's a dog party. Sometimes it needs a website.

### Static-Comp-1
[https://github.com/zanedr/zr-comp-challenge-1](Static-Comp-1)
[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html](Original Static-Comp-1 outline)

A tribute to a great piece of American cinema. First experience with
designing for different screen sizes.

### Static-Comp-2
[https://github.com/zanedr/zr-comp-challenge-2](Static-Comp-2)
[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html](Original Static-Comp-2 outline)

Had to learn to apply CSS to multiple HTML element simultaneously. Really
digging creative license.

### Static-Comp-3
[https://github.com/zanedr/zr-comp-challenge-3](Static-Comp-3)
[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html](Original Static-Comp-3 outline)

By far the most complex of the static comps. Definitely ran into some CSS
headaches, and still a lot to learn, but all in all a great challenge.

### Number-Guesser
[https://github.com/zanedr/number-guesser](Number-Guesser)
[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html](Original Number-Guesser outline)

The first assignment using more than the most rudimentary Javascript. It
was a challenge, but we overcame, and now can share with the world
the child-like joy of guessing numbers.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

#### Notes:

#### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

#### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

#### Fundamental HTML

- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

#### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

### Rubric

#### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

#### Workflow

- 2.75: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

#### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

To me, the most beneficial part of the Gear Up sessions was getting to know
the other members of the cohort. There will be a point when we go separate
ways, but as long as we're sharing our time in Turing we need to work as a
team. Input from others can frame a problem that wasn't translating in such
a way as to make it understandable. The more minds invested in the team means
more diversity of thought, and a stronger approach as a whole.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback



### Being a Community Member

###Keji Amos
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
The interactions we've had have been great. They're really beneficial and improve my ability to get things done. I've appreciated your willingness to answer and try to answer a lot of questions I've had. You also help me stay on top of my game.

###Travis Gregory
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
I felt like we had a good partnership. Communication lines were always open and when I didn't understand something you didn't take any issue with explaining it.
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
Your help and input on projects and such has been very helpful throughout this mod and I would say has helped me learn a lot that I wasn't able to get on my own.
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
Just make sure to talk more with partners on projects so that they know what you are thinking as you are doing it rather than after you've done the work.

###Adam Carpenter
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
Never partnered...damn shame.
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
Our interactions have greatly helped me and my team understand the coding messes we got ourselves into. The class as a whole would have been in a much rougher area without you, as you possess the strongest understanding for javascript in our mod.
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
Don't graduate or get a job too early or our mod will be lostttttt
####Any comments or brutally honest truths I should know?
bass is better then treble.

###John Binning
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
I felt good about the pairing.  Zane was a bit more advanced in his Javascript than I was, but he took time to slow down and explain his thought process.  
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
Zane has been encouraging and helpful.  He always has a positive attitude and is willing to share what he knows.
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
Maybe your knowledge of technical terms?  It's still not bad but you mentioned you didn't feel confident in it.
####Any comments or brutally honest truths I should know?
Sometimes it seems things come a bit faster to you and you think they are easy.  They don't necessarily come easy for everyone else though, and when you say "oh that's easy" it sometimes makes me feel like I'm behind because it isn't easy for me.  However, overall it's been great working with you this mod.

###Leta
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
I felt POSITIVELY about the experience! Working on 2DoBox with you was great. I felt like I learned a lot about Javascript, and it was fun to solve problems together.
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
It's nice to get to know the back row more, haha
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
I think our partnership was good. I did know that my Javascript skills were not as strong as yours, so I made it a point to mention that I wanted to drive - which you were very open to, of course! So no real suggestion for improvement - just wanted to provide insight from my perspective!
####Any comments or brutally honest truths I should know?
You're killing it! :)

###Devin Dixon
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
n/a
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
You've been an awesome addition to the cohort. Always supportive and light-hearted, with an open-mind towards new ideas both in programming and life in general.
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
I'd say just keep doing what you're doing.
####Any comments or brutally honest truths I should know?
You're a cool dude, dude.

###Devon Bull
####If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about the experience? Any highlights or criticism?
I noticed your speed was occasionally significantly faster than another person's who you were helping. One of your partners would come back with a look complete and utter confusion.
####How have our interactions affected your experience in class, if at all?
Always gave me something to think on. It is super fun to try and keep up with you.
####What should I improve or work on over the upcoming mods?
Nothing.
####Any comments or brutally honest truths I should know?
Oklahoma < Texas
