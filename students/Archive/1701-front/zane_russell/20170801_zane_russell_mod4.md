### Module 4 - 1701 FE

**Areas of Emphasis**

At the beginning of this mod my main goal was to hone the skills I've gained thusfar at Turing.  By week two the goal switched to simply keeping up with the large amount of information.  The huge range of topics this mod was great, and though I can't claim to have mastered any, being familiar with the subjects was beneficial.
 
 **Rubric scores** - Fill in how YOU would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:
 
 * End-of-Module Assessment: 3.  It ended up working, but I spent so much time trying to get React integrated that I didn't have time to polish and design it.  In hindsight, trying something new on an eval was a mistake.  I wish I'd jumped in with what I already knew and could have spent that time polishing the project.

 * Individual Work & Projects: 3. There was a lot covered this mod.  As much as I don't want to admit it, this was the first point at Turing where I really began to feel burned out, and my work suffered because of it.
 
 * Group Work & Projects: 3.5. Working in groups was great, and everyone I was paired with was very competent and communicative.  My best work was done in a team environment, due both to the benefit of different minds, and the natural motivation that comes with working with good people.
 
 * Professional Development: 3.

 * Feedback & Community Participation: 3.

	* Summary of how you've contributed to the community

		I began the mod leading Iron-Fe every Thursday, but unfortunately that seems to be a high pressure day for all mods.  After the third week of no one attending I made the executive decision to cancel the Thursday session. I paired with a few mod-3ers whenever they reached out and tried to be a generally encouraging presence for the folks around me. 

	* A recap of reflections from Gear Up
	
      I really enjoyed leading the gear up.  The subject we tackled, fake news, is broad and ill-defined, and we had a great conversation with those who attended. Everyone was engaged and had great thoughts and points to contribute.  There's no way to truly solve a problem as complicated as misinformation, but, somewhat poetically, simply thinking critically is a start.
