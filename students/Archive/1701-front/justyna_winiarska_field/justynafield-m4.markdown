# Justyna Winiarska-Field - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
**What did you set out to accomplish this module?**

I wanted to learn how backend works and how it works in relation to front end. I have learnt a lot during this module. I got a pretty good understanding of Node, Express, Knex, Postgres and backend testing. It was interesting to learn about security. I also appreciate learning SASS. It felt nice to go back to coding in jQuery.

## Gear up
Our group lead the session on UX/UI. We discussed the differences between the two, provided examples of good and bad UX/UI, we also talked about Design Thinking. We created a slack channel for our gear-up group and invited participating students. It was an interesting experience running a GearUp, it allowed me to see it from a different perspective.
