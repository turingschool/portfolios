# Justyna Winiarska-Field - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module?**

My goal for this module was to get to the point where I feel comfortable writing code in React. I wanted to learn to make API calls and get more practice manipulating large data sets. I also wanted to develop logical thinking and strengthen fundamental JavaScript.

Passing Scores


## B: Individual Work & Projects

## Sailing Club App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/Self-Directed-Project)

The project I chose to build is a web appliaction for a sailing/ racing club at Union Reservoir, CO. It is a site where user can check wind conditions on the lake: wind speed, direction and gust, like also general weather conditions (visibility and temp). User is also able to record their sailing/racing logs (date/ boat name / distance / time / details). That information can be added and persists on page after refresh. I am plannig to keep working on this project. I would like to add login/logout functionality, routing, have other data come in via api (photographs, or racing results).

### Evaluator: Meeka

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.


## C: Group Work & Projects

## HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/headcount2.0)

### Evaluator: Meeka
### Project Partner: Travis Gregory


#### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

#### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing

Not expected to update this project, teammates should focus on next testing in SwapiBox.

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


## SWAPIbox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

### Evaluator: Taylor
### Project Partner: Laura Turk


#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing



## Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

### Evaluator: Jhun
### Partners on the Project: Leta Keane, Kelly Miller, Devin Dixon


#### Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## Gear Up

#### Automation
It was an interesting session for me because I have never given it enough thought before. I really liked how students had to stand on either side of the classrooom to show how much they are for or against automation. It was also a very interesting discussion with other students becasue there were very good arguments made on both sides. I like how Mod4 students facilitated the group discussions and how this particular session had a quite different structure.  

#### Tragedy of the Commons
An interesting comment was made by one of the students, which was that by nature people try to surround themselves with those who are like them. It is sometimes very difficult to avoid bias, because subconsciously we make subjective judgements about other people. If management selects 1/3 of workers who are like them, those people might dominate the entire work environment and create a specific culture at work. 


## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Leta:
It was nice to get to work on a group project with you! Your ideas are good and I think you are stronger than you think you are. Your CSS was killer for MovieTracker. I think the only thing I'd suggest is to just be bolder in taking the lead. You did specifically ask to drive a few times; that was great! Your skillz are good - trust in them :)

#### Feedback from Travis:
Working with Justyna was a great experience. She is very organized and driven when working with her projects. I learned a lot about testing from working with her. Justyna also did a great job at bringing me back from the edge when I would get stressed out about parts of the project. The biggest thing I would recommend Justyna work on would be her confidence in her abilities. During or project she would quickly get anxious when we came across a problem we couldn’t quickly solve but in the end we made it work. I think Justyna is highly capable developer despite what she may think sometimes and look forward to pairing with her in the future.

#### Feedback from Laura:
Justyna, I really enjoyed working with you. We communicated well and you are indefatigable partner. I appreciated how, when we were getting down to the wire, you were willing to divide and conquer and take on specific aspects of the project. This was a challenging project and I don't think either one of us managed our stress particularly well in the middle days. I would encourage you to show more confidence in pairing. There were moments when I felt I was rushing you or pressuring you, and would have been happy to hear , "stop!" or "i got this!". Overall, partnering with you was a success, and I'm glad you were my partner for what turned out to be one of the more difficult projects this mod.


### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for Laura:
Laura, I learnt a lot while working with you. I especially appreciated how you guided me in writing tests for our application. I think that our communication has been great throughout the entire time. I think you work very hard and have great structure. I think we both need to work on managing stress, when working on new and complex problems under pressure of time. But overall this pairing experience has been great, and I would not mind working with you again.

#### Feedback for Leta:
Leta, I appreciated working with you on Movie Tracker. It was a great group experience. You are a very helpful partner and very dependable. I like how we brainstormed ideas and worked on problems together. I also really like how you’ve always made sure to appreciate our partners when they did something well. It really built up good supportive atmosphere in the group. It was a very difficult project, and I think we all need to work on being more bold when faced with such a big challenge. Our entire Movie Tracker team has been great though. There were absolutely no problems within the team that I would observe. Communication was great.

#### Feedback for Travis:
What I really admire about Travis is his very strong perseverance in working through the project and making sure that none of the iterations stays incomplete. Travis was a huge support for me when I felt stressed and overwhelmed by the project. He maintained a cool head throughout the entire time, and was really good about keeping us on track. Travis is always available and eager to work. I enjoyed working together with Travis.


### Playing a Part

I have been trying to be involved in the Turing community as much as I could. I participated in Iron FE. 
I have also developed some good relationships with other students.
