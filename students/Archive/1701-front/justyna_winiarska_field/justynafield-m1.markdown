# Justyna Winiarska-Field - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to set solid foundations in css, html and javascript, that I could build on going forward. I also wanted to go through the first module and see how I deal with fast-paced working environment and if an intensive program like Turing works well for me. Being exposed to the coding community was an important part. All of that gave me confirmation that I want to keep studing hard and complete this program as a Front-End Developer.

### Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

####Evaluator: Bree

Notes:
* I really appreciate your attention and care where accessibility is concerned. Keep it up!
* Solid design eye
* While we discussed areas of improvement in markup and CSS, it was overall well structured and organized

Design Integrity
- 4: The comp beautifully articulates the original design intent and there are no areas where an instructor would make changes with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements.

Responsive Layout
- 3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

HTML Style
- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

CSS Style
- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I appreciate that Turing teaches us to undertake the growth, rather than fixed, approach to learning. It's most important when learning a new field. I constantly remind myself and try to develop growth mindset so I can engage more deeply into the studies.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

Interesting outlook on learning - mastering few subjects at a time, rather than burning your cognitive resources at all  times. I didn't fully understand this concept at first, but after some time it made a lot of sense to me how it can be a very helpful learning technique. 

#### Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Great team work, it was good to talk with other students about how they deal with stress.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I found this session very interesting. It was good to learn about some problems in the industry. Discussion following the movie was engaging and brought up some interesting points.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for John: I really enjoyed working with John. We determined our working relationship right away with great respect of each other’s working habits and schedule differences. During our work process we exchanged clarifying questions. If there was any part of the project that one of us did not fully understand we would stop and take time to walk each other through the problem and make sure that we both fully understand that topic. I feel like we both equally contributed into the project, it was a very good pairing experience.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from John B:  Working with Justyna was great.  We had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind.  I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started.  I would be happy to work with her again.

### Playing a Part

I tried to be involved as much as I could. I participated in Turing events and took part in lunch roulette several times. I tried to establish many good relationships with other students in the school. I feel good being a part of this community.
