# Ben Pepper - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I'll be honest, I had no idea what to expect this mod. I wanted to work with Javascript and some React. I got to touch both so there's that. Outside of that I was hoping to solidify my Rails knowledge and got to do that with some more advanced database things like delegations.

### End of Module Assessment

Didn't finish. Doing the retake.

### Work

## Team

#### Quantified Self

* [Quantified Self](https://github.com/bfpepper/quantify-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

This was our first project done in Javascript. It involved working with local storage, JQuery, and multiple pages. This was a daunting project at first but Thankfully Ali knew what she was doing and was able to help me understand the project better by the end.

* 17 tests, all feature tests, all passing.
* Would like to have seen some sad path testing
* Opportunity to refactor with code duplication in Diary.
* Fully functional, no bugs.

### Functional Expectations
3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

### HTML/CSS/UI
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.
### JS syntax and Style
3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

### Git Workflow
3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### MentorShIP

* [MentorSHIP](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/MentorSHIP)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

MentorSHIP is intended (when fully developed) to help students connect with mentors who are available. This is done as a full Rails app with the react-rails gem working on the front end.

### Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

### Completion & Pace
3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

### Implementation Quality
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

### Application of Techniques
3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

### Documentation
3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

#### First Unitarian Society of Denver app

* [FUSD App](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/fusdIJC)

This is an app thought up by Kris Foss of 1603.  We attend the same church and the messaging system for the Immigration Justice group is appalling and confusing. They are currently using Google forums. This leads to email chains that are long, confusing and lack any real ability to comprehend the needs of the community. She and I have been working on making a site which can be easier to user and navigate. Our hope is to make this the hub for all communications so the community can better understand its own needs.

##### Instructor Feedback
- Glad you're able to apply some of the security we've taught you
- Glad you're working on a project for a real use
- Seems like you've at least thought a little about security
- Are the old people ok with that UI? Maybe Forums are natural for old people, because forums are old

## Community

### Personal Development Deliverables
[The delieverable gist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1608-b/ben_pepper.md)

###Gear Up

[Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This is always a tricky subject for me. partly because in economic terms the Tragedy of the Commons is more about over using public resources, not how to make an inclusive society.  That being said, helping people understand one another is critical for any society to work properly. And I think showing the Parable of the Polygons was an important step in this mission.

[Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I mean who doesn't love free money. This was actually my senior thesis in undergrad so being able to discuss it was a joy for me. The one thing I learned was that people don't seem to understand how the money gets there. We can tax the rich, sure, but that then disincentivise them to work more after a certain point, thus reducing the size of the economic pie. Basic income seems more to be a stop gap in the march towards the next economic system then a permenant thing we will always have.

[Turing Career Development: Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Well we're all screwed. Not really but that was the general feeling. Either it being that no one makes money and because of that no one can afford anything to machines are going to take over everything. Neither is true but thats whatever. Machines do one thing very well (whatever that is). and if no one is making money then everything will cost $0. thats just basic economics. It was fun to see the world from other people's perspectives given that I work for Tesla and have seen Auto Pilot grow up in the last 2 years.

### PROtocol

* Lead two spike sessions
* Paired with three Mod 1 students
* Helped a Mod 3 group understand why serializers are better.
* Did a Tuesday Lightning Talk

### Giving Feedback

To: Ali Schlereth
Ali is an amazing partner. Her grasp of JQuery and Javascript is stunning. She made Quantified Self far more tolerable and her enthusiasm when something finally worked was refreshing. Ali is more than capable as a programer and as a member of any team that she has been or will be a part of.

Ali, don't burn yourself out. Turing and the job can be draining and there will be times that things don't get done in time. Just roll with the punches and don't let it stress you. I know it's a tautological statement but the cards will fall where they will. There are a few things you can do to affect them but with any project there are too many moving parts to control. Just do you and you'll be fine.

To: Megan Talbot
It was a pleasure working with Megan again. Her dedication to the project and making things work is inspiring. Her ability to get thrown into a new situation and then fully grasp the concept was stunning and something I hope to emulate soon.

Megan, You always produce amazing apps with stunning code. You should always be proud of what you produce no matter what it is. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked in MentorSHIP but the code we produced was good and sets up 1610 for a strong start. The work you put into the front end made the site easily navigable and easy to look at.

To: Jon Kimble
It was my first time work with Jon. I couldn't have asked for a better team member. He constantly beings enthusiasm and enjoyment into whatever he is doing. Jon constantly amazes me with his outgoing nature and that he always has a smile on his face. His drive to learn more each day is something I hope to emulate as I get into the industry.

Jon, You guys did a hell of a job getting React to work with MentorSHIP. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked with the app but the codebase we are leaving for 1610 is far better than we were handed. Thats part of brown field, can we leave this better then we found it? We did. Thats a lot and will only serve to set up 1610 for quick success. You did a lot to help that and they will have you to thank for it.

To: Vido Seaver
This was the first project I worked on with Vido. His ability to understand a problem and tackle it is wonderful. He has an ability to look at a problem and see a solution. Several times we paired trying to figure out what the next step was and Vido was able to articulate the solution and navigate through all the issues.

Vido, I know it can be frustrating taking steps back in a project. Its shitty to re-do something several times and have to wait for other things to complete. Its part of the job. Getting stressed hurts you and your team. Try to take a step back and just roll with the punches when they come. You know what you're doing and can accomplish a lot. Just control what you can and let the other things fall by the way side.

### Being a Community Member

From Ali Schlereth:

Ben was a great partner. Coming in to Quantified Self, he was eager to learn all about JavaScript. We quickly hit an onboarding pattern of setting out a prototype (not the JS kind) and then he recreated it to help himself solidify the knowledge. Ben was determined to find solutions and a diligent worker. I think he would benefit from giving himself a bit more time to figure things out before seeking outside help. He was a great collaborator who listened as much as he spoke. Ben made for a great learning partner!  

From Vido Seaver:

Ben you're strong developer. You picks your cards and get it done. I’m shocked that you are being told to retake the final. It makes me think the whole thing is predetermined. You’re also great at giving feedback and you get the shit done you say he will. Your energy is a little frenetic  and I think you'd do well to slow down a little. I didn’t get to pair with you that much but when we did you was sharp, quick and on point.  I got a little frustrated with you in regards to the database design but that is water under bridge and you handled that quite well. I had a good time working with you and would gladly do it again.

From Jon Kimble

Ben it was great getting a chance to work with you during mod4, you were a stong teammate willing to take on hard techinical challenges and manage a signifigant portion of project.  Even when things got tough you kept working and moving our teams forward.  Thanks for all the great experiences and staying strong in mod4, I hope we get the chance to work together again in the future!

From Megan Talbot:

Ben was a great partner this module. We have worked together in the past, and I have always appreciated how easygoing he is. Ben is always eager to help and pitch in, which is such a great way to be. I know he felt a little burned out at times this module, but he always stayed committed to our group and project. I think he will be very successful in his career and I wish him all the best!
