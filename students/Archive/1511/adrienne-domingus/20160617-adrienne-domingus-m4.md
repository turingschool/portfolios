# Adrienne Domingus - M4 Portfolio

## Mission and Goals

I went into M4 with some confidence that I had a preference for back-end/server-side work, but wanted to approach JavaScript with an open mind, and make a strong effort to learn the skills I would need to develop in JavaScript, as it seems likely that no matter where I end up working, there will be some expectation of that. While I do feel that my JavaScript ability improved greatly, it did reiterate my preference for back-end work.

My other main goal in M4 was to write clean and well tested code, with less emphasis on rolling out features rapidly. Module 4 did seem to provide a unique opportunity to do this, and while I did have to sacrifice this at times to complete features on a specified deadline, I feel like I struck a reasonable balance that I hope to carry forward into the workplace.

#### Peer Feedback

"I will miss your big smile and kind attitude! You have taught me a lot (more than you can imagine) throughout this cohort! Your approach to the projects, the admiration that everyone has for you (including Jeff and his amazing Twitter post about you), and all the amazing inputs you brought to be table during our SAB meetings. I have no doubt in my mind that whatever you choose to do in this life, you will be great at it! Can't wait to hear what the future holds for you, and again! Thank you so much for being you!" -** Raphael Barbo **

"There is no other way to describe Adrienne except that she is a BOSS (I definitely don't say this lightly). Her work habits are clockwork and she works at a crushing pace; I regularly went to bed having finished a pull request and woke up expecting to have comments and new code to look at. I have no idea what she wants out of her programming career, but she will certainly accomplish anything she puts her mind to. I look forward to continuing our pairings and hope that I will get to be involved in anything cool she works on." - ** Erinna Chen**

“Adrienne and I haven’t had the chance to pair during any of our modules, and it makes me sad as I feel I would have learned a lot.  We are in the Brin Posse together where the objective is to finish as many exercisms as possible before graduation.  Adrienne has blown everyone out of the water.  Not only is she a brilliant programmer, but she’s also great at building people up.  She is very genuine and her words of encouragement have made my day a few times throughout the modules.  I can’t wait to see where she ends up.  I know she’s bound for big things!" - ** David Whitaker **

"Adrienne could be one of greatest assets that our module has coming out of Turing. I say that because all of us will be able to say we knew her way back when, as she will probably be in a C level position in the next 10 years. Not only is her programming ability second to none, but her drive and leadership is impeccable. She is destined for greatness. Working with Adrienne on classwork and specifically endpoints for Exercism.io is always a learning experience for me. I always come away from the interactions with a piece of knowledge that I didn’t have before. I’m excited to see how she will become a female force to be reckoned with in the tech world and hope to stay in touch with her after Turing." - ** Adam Hundley **

#### Feedback For Others

** Erinna Chen: ** "Working with Erinna was a highlight of Turing pairing experiences. Not only is she a talented developer, but she shows an impressive commitment to clean code, refactoring, and testing at all phases of her work. Doing this early and often was invaluable to our ability to be successful at later stages of the project. She also shows a willingness to help others, and is fun to be around to boot!"

** David Whitaker: ** "I never actually paired with David during any of our modules, so I'm pretty sure I missed out there, but nonetheless, David had a consistently positive impact on our cohort culture. He always had an encouraging word for anyone who needed it, and showed a dedication to producing high quality work and learning as much as he could. I'm confident he'll be a great addition to any company he joins, both for his attitude and programming abilities."

** Raphael Barbo: ** "While I didn't work with Raphael on any programming this module, I was continually impressed by his approach to his work throughout the module. He showed an understanding of the bigger picture, a positive attitude even when things were tough, and an openness to new experiences and ways of thinking. He's a positive addition to the Turing community, and I'm confident he'll be successful moving forward!"

** Adam Hundley: ** "Working with Adam throughout our time at Turing has been a highlight of pairing experiences, both through assigned projects and mutual work on open source. He thinks quickly on his feet whether working on something we've been taught or something entirely new, and is committed not just to getting things done, but to getting things done the right way. His dedication both do honing his craft and becoming an awesome developer and to building the community is a powerful combination, and I know it will take him far. it's been a fun ride!"

### Notes

Enjoyed taking time to really write clean code and meet personal goal. 

Adrienne is always paying close attention, something Jeff always notices as an active participant and listener. Great as a student, but also something that peers notice.
