# Adrienne Domingus - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission at the beginning of the module was simply to learn the skills necessary to become an employable software developer, and to immerse myself daily in something that would provide interesting intellectual challenges.

That has expanded over the past six weeks to include additional goals around community and soft skills. Turing is an incredible community of people looking not only to help each other develop their skills, but to make the world a better place, and I hope to engage more in that moving forward. I also hope to improve on my soft skills to be a better partner for team projects and build stronger relationships.

### Attendance

I did not miss any classes.

### Work

The following projects were completed individually during weeks 2 and 3 of module 1.

#### Jungle Beats

**Assessed by**: Andrew Carmer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

**Description**: Make a drum machine that's backed by a linked list.

**Comments**:
"All around a good showing of code. I liked most of what I saw but there was some inappropriate use SRP. The list class didn't instantiate node and had some weird functionality. Everything worked, but some bad practices. I liked where it was heading though. While we spoke she showed a clear understanding of things."

**Scores**:
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic Into Components: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Enigma

**Assessed by**: Tess Griffin

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

**Description**: Build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

No comments were provided.

**Scores**:
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3

## Team

### Projects

The following projects were completed in weeks 4-6 of module 1.
Partners were:
Nate Venn for HTTP Yeah You Know Me
Matt Packer for Headcount

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

**Assessed by**: Josh Cheek

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

**Description**: Introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and build a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

**Sample of Comments**:
* Rename your things (earlier). It's not that hard, and the amount of mental overhead it will save you will make up for the mental overhead you put in to do the change.
* Many tests are unit tests (can be run without making web requests)
* Decouple body generation from request counting
* The decision of where to combine the command-line output with the server stuff is absolutely correct!

**Scores**:
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Headcount

**Assessed by:** Horace Williams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

**Description**: Build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation. What can we learn about education across the state?

**Comments**:
* implements expected iterations
* good job tackling vaguely defined result set / result entry stuff in I6
* tests are numerous and effective, relying on a trimmed data set to support easy testing and anticipation of results
* would have liked to see some means of overriding the data set from tests without having to edit the data files
* connections between the analyst and the various repositories are clear and easy to follow; however it does place the Analyst in a privileged position at the top of the hierarchy
* discovered a somewhat rigid dependency on the file structure with harcoded paths in a few places
* analysis methods are well-written and easy to follow; using appropriate enumerables and data helpers to filter down the data set as needed

**Scores**:
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

**Nate Venn**: "Pairing with Nate on HTTP Yeah You Know Me was a very positive experience. He has a great attitude and remains calm under pressure. He asks good questions and took extra time outside of our pairing sessions to go back and understand things he didn't initially, and wrote most of our test suite! If there is one thing he could work on, it would be to have more confidence in his abilities - he knows more than he thinks."

**Deborah Hamel**: "Deb has a wonderful positive impact on group dynamics. She gives people positive feedback unsolicited, and builds others up around her. My advice to her would be to be patient with herself, give herself the time she needs without worrying so much about comparing herself to others. The growth that she has shown over the past weeks has been incredible, as is the effort she's put in and I know she'll continue on that trajectory."

**Nick Weiland** "Nick not only shows strong programming skills, but also shows a passion for the work. He gets engrossed in the problems and continues to look for better solutions. We had fun when we had opportunities to pair together, as we could explore and bounce ideas off of each other. He maintains a fun and low stress attitude that is easy to be around!"

### Being a Community Member

“Adrienne’s dedication to getting the most out of her time at Turing serves as a daily motivator to improve. Her eagerness to learn new concepts along with a habit reflecting on the quality of her code not only leads to impressive results, but also an awesome pairing experience." **-Nick Weiland**

"Adrienne might be one of the most talented programmers in our cohort. I got to experience her strong technical skill set while pairing with her on HTTP Yeah you know me. She is able to quickly grasp concepts and almost immediately implement solutions. Like most of us she lacks confidence in her abilities and holds on to her anxieties. Once she builds up her confidence and lets her anxieties go she will dominate! Adrienne as a person  was a pleasure to work with and I look forward to collaborating with her in the future " **-Nate Venn**

"Adrienne is one of the most caring and disciplined people in our cohort. This is a powerful combination. I don't think she fully appreciates the strength and beauty in her vulnerable side. I hope she knows how much it has meant to me to see someone so successful be vulnerable too. She inspires me to keep doing my best and has been a cheerleader whispering in my ear when I most needed it." **-Deb Hamel**

### Playing a Part

I have regularly participated in both Kay Posse events and the Joan Clarke Society. There are numerous other opportunities that looked both useful and interesting that I would have liked to take advantage of, but felt like I didn't have time. I hope to prioritize this next module.
