# Adrienne Domingus - M3 Portfolio

## Mission and Goals
My main goal coming into module 3 was to create projects not just that met the spec requirements, but that I was proud of. Additional goals included increasing my ability to immerse myself quickly in existing code bases and contribute to them, and to be able to work effectively with documentation to implement features that weren't taught in classes.

### Rails Engine

* **Completion**: 4

**Technical Quality**

* **Test-Driven Development**: 4
* **Code Quality**: 4
* **API Design**: 3
* **Queries**: 4

#### Notes

* Controller organization is obvious: think about how to reduce some of the duplication
* Use serializers instead of built in Rails JSON functions to maintain data integrity, reduce formatting in model methods - move view functionality out of the model
* Good use of ActiveRecord instead of SQL

### Self-Directed Project

### Final Assessment

Assessed by: Josh Mejia

#### Scores

* **Ruby Style**: 3
* **Rails Syntax & API**: 4
* **Testing**: 3
* **Progress/Completion**: 3
* **Workflow**: 4

#### Notes

* Looks like the initial implementation of the service was using "search" instead of "longDescription"
* Good understanding of all key learning points from the module even though the final implementation wasn't quite working. Git history shows a good process.

### Community

## Peer Feedback

"Working with Adrienne was an absolute pleasure. She epitomizes the ideal teammate: hard-working, collaborative, deeply intelligent, and with a positive attitude. She was never afraid to tackle difficult features, integrating javascript and other extensions while helping to teach her teammates along the way. She is so incredibly hard-working that I fear she may eventually suffer burnout, but assuming it continues to bring her joy, Adrienne will be an awesome developer." **-Scott Firestone**  

"Adrienne is a coding machine with a sense of humor to boot. I can honestly say that she is the most driven developer I have paired with and has the smarts to compliment her work ethic. Her red green refactor coding habits are excellent. She does not get caught up in ambivalence when writing tests or making them pass the first time around and has the refactoring skills to compliment her aptitude for production. My suggestion for Adrienne is to maintain her tenacity but exercise patience to write robust tests before diving in." **-Brian Rippeto**

## Feedback For Others

**Brian Rippeto** "Great pairing experience with Brian. He showed an impressive commitment to learning throughout the project, actively seeking to take on parts of the project he wasn't sure he knew how to do and asking questions, and showed a lot of growth. Brian was also very responsive to all communication and generous with his time to make sure everyone on the team had what they needed to move forward. One thing he could work on is his comfort in researching and finding what he is looking for in documentation, and being willing to try brand new things independently, even if we hadn't been taught."

**Scott Firestone** "Scott was fun to pair with. He showed a lot of dedication to creating a high quality product and and awesome UX, and has strong technical and problem solving abilities. He was very thorough and observant both in the work that he produced, and in reviewing others' work, and saved us some headaches because of it! One thing Scott could work on (which he is already conscious of and working on), is his work habits and ability to focus on the task at hand without getting distracted."

## Participation

* Participated in weekly Joan Clarke Society events
* Paired weekly with Kris Sparks, 1603
* Hosted Edward Loveall

## Posse
As a member of Brin posse I:
* Contributed to the posse app, including creating a new API endpoint for exercism.io to make completion data accessible automatically
* Valuable takeaway: accountability to maintain my Ruby skills, and to experiment with other languages, and to keep looking for a better solution to a problem, instead of just settling for the first thing that works. 

## Attendance

I didn't miss any classes.

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.


### Instructor Scores

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 4
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
