# Adrienne Domingus - M2 Portfolio

## Mission and Goals
* Write cleaner code from the start
* Regularly pair with 1602 students
* Pair more collaboratively, be comfortable with different skill levels and paces.

## Evaluation Notes

### Rush Hour
[Project Repo](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/rush_hour)  
[Original Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

#### Scores
**Functional Expectations:** 3  
**Test-Driven Development:** 3.5  
**Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3.5  
**Fundamental Ruby & Style:** 3  
**Sinatra/Web and Business Logic:** 3.5  
**View Layer:** 3

#### Notes
* Functionality: we had a small bug in the hour-by-hour event breakdown, but fixed it quickly after the evaluation
* Testing: Like how payloads are broken out into their own module, but consider how much data you actually need to test the functionality - you don't need 15 payloads. Also - separate integration tests into their own folder.
* Views: we had a couple small bits of logic leaking into the Views
* Liked how much of the server responsibility was broken out into objects with a single responsibility, and had recommendations for how we could implement something similar for paths that included redirects

### Little Shop

#### Scores  
**Feature Completeness:** 4  
**Views:** 3  
**Controllers:** 4  
**Models:** 4  
**Testing:** 4  
**Usability:** 4  
**Workflow:** 4  

#### Notes
* UI is great. Very intuitive. Only suggestion is to add link to login or create user if in opposite page  
* Extensions were great. JavaScript - Calendar - Reddit API
* Had one custom action - could have pulled it out into a sub-controller

### Community

## Peer Feedback
"Adrienne did an amazing job of driving our team to complete deliverables in a timely manner. She grasped active record at a lightening pace and fixed bugs that plagued the project when we turned it in because she passionately cared about the team and project. She could treat herself to more of a break in the evenings/weekends in order to have a better school life balance." **-Adam Hundley**

"Adrienne did a good job with taking charge of the project, asking good questions, and being a hard worker because she is a very driven and dedicated person. I think she could be more welcoming and relaxed in order to promote a lighter team environment." **-July Tran**

"Pairing with Adrienne on a weekend Rails project was a bright spot in Turing pairing opportunities. Even if she didn’t have such a strong technical approach and ability to step through new code challenges, I felt like we would’ve been successful due to her methodical completeness and debugging aptitude. Interactions were enjoyable and comfortable because she’s so even-keeled and and patient. I enjoyed both the process and the output. Because she is so well-balanced it’s hard to find an avenue of critique to offer, but I would recommend that she be more forceful when she knows something absolutely, as to give her partners clues to her very stoic input." **-Heidi Hoopes**

"Adrienne is the full package: strong organization, algorithmic thinking, and creativity. This was demonstrated by her leadership role in the Little Shop Project were we successfully completed base functionality several days ahead of schedule. Adrienne can continue to work on stepping out of the box. Given her high level of performance she can expertly stay with in the lines even if client requirements require her to jump through hoops. This may not always be the right answer and should be weighed with skepticism given she is the expert."**-Allan Blair**

"Adrienne is a solid developer that any team would be lucky to have. She demonstrates excellent problem solving skills and is comfortable taking on new challenges. She always took time to "DTR" with me, and was happy to explain any concepts I did not understand. Adrienne was an excellent project manager; she always mindful of the group dynamic, maintained our waffle.io board,  and took steps to resolve any miscommunications. Occasionally Adrienne appeared dismissive of the other group member's ideas (even if they were terrible and deserved to be dismissed). Next time, Adrienne could explain why the idea could not be implemented. I really enjoyed working with Adrienne and look forward to our next collaboration!"**-Chelsea Johnson**

## Feedback For Others

* **Chelsea Johnson:** "Chelsea is an awesome teammate. Not only is she strong technically, but she has a sense of humor and attitude that makes work time enjoyable. When we hit snags, Chelsea is open to other people's ideas and provides her own, resulting in a better end result than either of us could have produced independently, and she consistently follows through with the work she commits to. One area of growth for Chelsea would be her willingness to try new things, even if she's not sure how they work - once she starts, she clearly has the ability to research and tinker until she gets things working, but has unnecessary nervousness about jumping in. Great pairing experience!"  

* **Allan Blair:** "Allan is a strong programmer who shows passion for and dedication to learning as much as he can, above and beyond what is required of him. He shows creativity in the approach he takes to solving new problems, as well as a consistent ability to solve what comes his way.  Allan can continue to work on having more forgiveness/patience with team members when they make mistakes or don't understand something."  

* **Heidi Hoopes:** "Heidi was a highly engaged, dedicated, and communicative partner on the Rails Mini Project. She was full of ideas and showed interest in learning things she wasn't already comfortable with. My main feedback for her would be to have more confidence in her abilities."

* **Adam Hundley:** "Adam was great to work with - an excellent thought partner when pairing or troubleshooting, in addition to being reliable and thorough when dividing and conquering. I appreciated his consistently positive attitude and strong work ethic - it's a powerful combination, and I hope to have the opportunity to pair with him again."  

* **July Tran:** "July was great with maintaining a positive work environment when we were together. I know she had a lot going on in her life that week, but I felt like her follow through on some of the divide and conquer tasks was incomplete, and I would have liked her to have been more engaged when we were pairing together, even if Adam or I was driving. Overall, her understanding of the work seemed complete, and she were reliably present when we needed her, and I appreciated her note-taking and debugging on the final sprint!"
