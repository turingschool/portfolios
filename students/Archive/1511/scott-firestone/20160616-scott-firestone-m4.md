* tiles placement isn't aware of correct side matching. small ding, would help with difficulty levels. Overall, really great game! Good job!
* The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
(evaluation scores)
* Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Giving Feedback

>**Kimi Kano:** "I finally had the pleasure of working with Kimi on Game Time. I found out very early on that Kimi is incredibly hard-working. I was sick the first few days of the project; while I’d go to sleep earlier, with or without all of my assigned issues completed, I’d find out the next day that Kimi stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning working on features. She challenged herself constantly, working with ES6 and tackling complicated view/game board implementation. Through the course of the project, I would get discouraged at times, and found out that Kimi is easily infected by the emotions around her, so that was sometimes challenging for both of us. I hope Kimi can become more self-confident and able to prop up teammates when they get down. Still, she’ll be an awesome developer no matter where she lands."

>**Admir Dragonovich:** "I had the pleasure of pairing with Admir several times over the last module. He is  a great  person to be around and work with, offering a certain brand of tempered enthusiasm that I can relate to.  I know that he's feeling kind of burnt out now, but I hope he can destress and get back to enjoying coding soon because I'm sure he'll make for a great dev."

>**Adam Hundley:** "Adam’s an awesome guy and super-conscientious student. He always seems engrossed in whatever he’s working on at school. He once helped me debug tests for my mod 3 personal project and was incredibly helpful, thoroughly explaining the issues along the way. It’s unfortunate I didn’t get to work with Adam on any projects during my time at Turing."

>"Scott and I worked on Game Time together this module. I was really excited to finally get to work with Scott and it was fun to be able to create a game together that we both know and enjoy. I'm proud of the fact that we had narrowed our game choice down to two games and although the other game would most likely have been a lot easier to implement, we decided to push ourselves and take on the more challenging game. In the end I was really proud of the project we turned out. I hope that we can continue to work on it and make it even better! The only thing Scott needs to work on is to be more diligent about testing... and be more confident... and learn css... that's it. He's excellent at playing board games and we have a good rivalry going on there. I think the strategory that he displays in playing board games has transferred well into his logical thinking in coding. I'm pretty sure there is a link there. Scott is very hard on himself sometimes, but he is a great developer and I'm very confident that he'll do well in his career and hopefully start his own business some day!"-**Kimi Kano**

>"Scott provides a brand of balanced enthusiasm that is uniquely his own. Pairing with him was always a very positive experience.  Scott is great at breaking apart complex problems and being able to communicate his ideas. With Scotts ability to collaborate and problem solve I know he will have no problem becoming a part of any dev team."-**Admir Dragonovich**

>"Scott is a great developer. There is no doubt about that. I never directly worked with him on a project but felt like he was resource over the past 2 modules as we used the Spotify API. We both had the ability to share in victories and defeats over what turned out to be not that bad of an API. Scott is talented at programming, but more importantly he's a good person. He has an ability to laugh off jokes (which come at his expense a lot) while still get the whole room to laugh with him. He is has been a vital asset to the 1511 cohort and I look forward to seeing what he does in the tech world."-**Adam Hundley**

### Playing a Part

* I co-led the Ritchie Posse again, planning and coordinating 2x per week meetings. Once per week we dove into topics
related to entrepreneurship, mostly an educational session. We also started working through the Google Design Sprint model
for building out a product idea. I plan to continue with the posse and this project past graduation, work/time allowing.
