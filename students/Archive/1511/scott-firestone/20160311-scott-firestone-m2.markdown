# Scott Firestone - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

#### Technical Goals
With Module 2, I wish to gain a proficiency with Rails. More specifically, by the time the module is complete, I would like to have built my own E-commerce side-project site, which accepts real payments. I would also like to have made a meaningful contribution to the side-project helping a charter school in Las Vegas.

Additionally, I want to focus on approving my testing skills, while pushing myself to improve my test-driven development.

#### Soft Skill Goal
For Module 2, considering the amount of side-work I'd like to accomplish, I want to build more structure to organize my time. I will create weekly goals to drive my outside-of-class time.

#### Results
Having nearly completed Module 2, I feel adequately proficient in rails. Why I didn't have an opportunity to build my own side-project, my "Little Shop" project is a great jumping off point to my own side-project idea. Likewise, I didn't have a chance to contribute to the charter school side-project, though plan to begin work in the coming weeks.

I do feel that I have improved my testing abilities, and am generally more committed to and embracing of TDD.

I also feel like I've made strides with building more structure in organizing my time, setting and holding myself to weekly goals.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Julian Feliciano:** In Module 2, I was lucky enough to work with Julian on Rush Hour and Little Shop. Julian came into Mod 2 with a great deal of knowledge on Rails and other languages/frameworks we had yet to tackle at Turing. My experiences reinforced my belief that he is an ideal teammate. He is insanely skilled at thinking about problems, writing tests, managing workflow, implementing code, debugging, etc, etc, etc. He also brings the perfect attitude/personality to a project. On Rush Hour, he was gracious enough to take a back seat and allow his teammates to drive mostly all of the coding. On both projects, he demonstrated his “can-do”, optimistic attitude as we worked through bugs and various git mishaps. I hope my string of luck continues and I get to work with Julian more in the future.

>**Admir Dragonovich:** Admir brings a great personality to the Turing community. We worked together on Little Shop. As we worked through the various aspects and challenges of the project, he always kept a cool, calm manner. While he struggled to understand some of the concepts during Mod 2, Admir sought support to improve, showing the persistence necessary to succeed at Turing. As a deeply thoughtful and intelligent person, Admir is a pleasure to have as a classmate.

>**Brian Rippeto:** Brian and I worked together on the Rails Mini-Project. While I didn’t know Brian too well prior to the project, in a short four days, it was clear that he is an exceptional teammate. He brought a positive yet joking attitude to the project that made the whole experience a lot of fun. While he might not always have the answer to a problem immediately, he has good instincts in troubleshooting, demonstrating a solid, broad understanding of the underlying concepts. I’m crossing my fingers that I’ll again have a chance to work with Brian.

### Being a Community Member

>Working with Scott is always a fun, hilarious, frustrating and enlightening. He is exceptional skilled when it comes to quickly tackling a problem and figuring out the direction that he needs to go to tackle the challenge. Rarely does he run into a problem that he can’t tackle and his code tends to be clean and maintainable. I would ask him to slow down when their is a situation that needs clear focus and organization. One attribute that sticks out is his willingness to speak his mind when he thinks there might be a clearer solution. His communication is clear and makes for an easy dialog. Overall, keep pairing me with Scott and I would be a happy teammate.-**Julian Feliciano**

>Scott and I paired up to complete the Rails Mini-Project and had many laughs in the process. Scott demonstrated great workflow and strong aptitude for problem solving through the portions of the project that challenged us. We were able to get into a good work flow by having structure to our pairing routine. I look forward to having Scott as a colleague on future work.-**Brian Rippeto**

>Working with Scott for the Not Napster project was one of the coolest projects I’ve ever done at Turing. I feel like I enjoyed it a lot due to the group I was with and how we all shared a common vision for making all of our favorite artist appear on the website. I mean, we added A Tribe Called Quest, K-Dot, Kanye, etc. Who else in Turing has mixed in hip-hop into their projects like we did? No one that I’m aware of. What I liked the most working with Scott was the fact of how he always kept his “product manager” position on point and always respecting everyone’s feedback whenever we felt something could be implemented a different way. I also enjoyed the fact how his style of working was different that others. For example, we would pretty much be in Classroom C and bump music while getting work done which is something I’ve never done in a group project. I also like how the group was managed very good by him by always making sure we followed the convention of posting issues on waffle and making sure before a pull request is merged that the whole team gets to check it.  I wouldn't mind working with you again homie keep on coming up with cool ideas too. I'll be looking forward to what your personal project will be.-**Alex Navarette**

>One of the things that I like about Scott is that he is normal and therefore we pair well together. He has a great sense of humor and keeps things light when under pressure. He often plans social events for venturing outside of the basement, which has increased the level of bonding within our cohort.  If I had to give him some critical feedback it would be to get a haircut or wear a headband because I think his long hair may be impairing him at times. I also think he should get out of his comfort zone and learn how to pair with people other than Julian on every project.-**Kimi Kano**

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* Notes: 

* Wanted to work on a side project
* Improving testing skills - made progress on testing
* Project management experience for little shop was a focus
* Challenge you to give a little more critical feedback - you have a valid opinion and people will value it. 
* Challenge you to focus on a technical blog post
* 

* **Result:**

Pass
