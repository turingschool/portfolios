## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Adrienne Domingus:** "Working with Adrienne was an absolute pleasure. She epitomizes the ideal teammate: hard-working, collaborative, deeply intelligent, and with a positive attitude. She was never afraid to tackle difficult features, integrating javascript and other extensions while helping to teach her teammates along the way. She is so incredibly hard-working that I fear she may eventually suffer burnout, but assuming it continues to bring her joy, Adrienne will be an awesome developer."

>**Kimi Kano:** "As members of the Ritchie Posse, Kimi and I worked on the food-it / food-me slackbot project during the Turing Hackathon. Kimi was deeply engaged in the project, offering ideas and solutions to move it forward. She brings a positive, “fun-to-be-around” attitude that really energizes her team. She does struggle with self-confidence at times, and she’s aware of it. Considering her work-ethic, attitude, and intelligence, I have supreme confidence in her ability to be a great developer for most any company. I would love to have her as a teammate in a professional setting."

### Being a Community Member

>"Scott was fun to pair with. He showed a lot of dedication to creating a high quality product and and awesome UX, and has strong technical and problem solving abilities. He was very thorough and observant both in the work that he produced, and in reviewing others' work, and saved us some headaches because of it! One thing Scott could work on (which he is already conscious of and working on), is his work habits and ability to focus on the task at hand without getting distracted."-**Adrienne Domingus**

>"Scott decided to take on the role of being a posse leader this module and he's done a wonderful job. He encouraged everyone in our posse to get involved in the hackathon, where we did not just one, but two posse projects. He's also been very generous with his time in helping out Mod 1 students with questions even when he had a lot of work to do on his own projects. I've leaned on him a lot this module for moral support and he's always there for me to lend an ear or help out with any questions that I may have. If there's a negative thing to say about Scott it's that he often tries to convince people to do "fun" things instead of studying and working on projects all the time. He's one of the few people that actually tries to plan social events in the midst of all of this, which does a lot to help boost morale and give us something to look forward to!"-**Kimi Kano**

### Playing a Part

With the posse transformation this module, I re-started and co-led the Ritchie Posse, providing academic support to several Mod 1 students, and leading a Hackathon project.

## Review

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* **Result:** TBD

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* **Result:** TBD

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* **Result:** TBD

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* **Result:** TBD

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* **Result:** TBD

### Instructor Scores

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 4
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
* C: Group Work & Projects: 4
* D: Community Participation: 4
* E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3

### Notes

- There's a pattern of low testing scores, but you've demonstrated that you have the testing knowledge. Just try to change that behavior. Employers will be upset with you, but they wont be as nice and communicative as us.
