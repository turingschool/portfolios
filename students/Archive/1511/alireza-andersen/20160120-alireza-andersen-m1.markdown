### Areas of Emphasis


Coming into this module I didn't feel strong in any programming language.  With absolutely no coding experience, my goal was and still is to obtain as much knowledge around the basics as possible.  As the module progressed, my competence has grown substantially.  This is reflected in the progressive improvement of the projects I've worked on, and contributes to my eagerness to take on Module 2.

My final assessment was a challenge that many struggled with, but my performance was still not at the level I know I can achieve.  Nonetheless, I believe my skills are good enough to move on. I know the educators want me to be successful and I have put my entire faith and career in their hands.  I look forward to continuing this program, obtaining this knowledge, and becoming a proud alumni of Turing School of Software and Design.

A failure is not always a mistake; it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying. *B.F Skinner*

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### JungleBeats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/jungle_beats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this 3-day project I implemented a linked list with recursion.

It was evaluated by Lovisa Svallingson with the following results:

"impressive logic and code..."

"developer understands what needs to be done conceptually...."

* Ruby Syntax: 2
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Functionality: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/enigma.git)

In this eight day project I created a Encryptor that used both a numerical quad code per letter or a single code per letter based on the users preference.  

Evaluated by Josh Cheeks with the following results:

Very good separation of concerns (encryptor doesn't know about its contexts: it doesn't know how to get the message/key/date, those are all decided by the caller, based on what is right for them) -- no ARGV, no files, just "give me the stuff I need to encrypt it, and I'll encrypt it"

* Ruby Syntax: -3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: +3
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Test-Driven Development: -3

## Team

### Projects

### http-yeah-you-know-me

I participated in the following team projects:

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Draganovic/http-yeah-you-know-me)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this 4 day project my partner Admir Draganovic and I created basic http server with some functionality. As my first pairing project. I felt that my team member and I were on pare throughout the entire project. Our dedication and passion is shown throughout our work and I am very proud of our score - the long Hours paid-off!

Evaluated by Josh Cheeks with the following results:

* 5 iterations, no extensions

* Very very nice toplevel method, I was able to go from not having seen any code at all to finding exactly the thing I was looking for, without a single incorrect guess.

* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: +4
* Overall Functionality: +3
* Test-Driven Development: 3

### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/black_thursday.git)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

In this 10-day project my partner Erinna Chen and I constructed a database from CSV files containing customer and merchant data from Etsy. As being the first module to work on this project our biggest challenge was working with the multiple amounts of broken specs that were provided to us by our instructors, the real word factor was in play. As my second pair projects Erinna and I support each other with our strengths and were push through this assignment.  Our dedication and passion is shown throughout our work and I am very proud of our score.

Evaluated by Horace Williams with the following results:

* Like the approach to turning relationship construction into a more declarative process
in the SalesEngine

* Analysis methods make good use of enumerables; use lots of helper methods to keep the code short and easy to follow

* Enumerables are strong and consistent throughout, nice use of stubbing in the tests to patch things together.

* Good work on extracting some common Stats processes; next step on this would have required some higher order function usage with blocks or maybe passing symbols to indicate which methods should be used within the analysis methods

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Feedback to Me

 "Ali is a terrific student who possesses all the fine characteristics one would find in an aspiring software developer. He is patient, methodical, and learns quickly. What I enjoy most about working with Ali is seeing his drive and motivation to push the boundaries when learning his lesson plans. He does so by asking intelligent questions and by making trenchant observations. As a mentor, I have witnessed Ali's growth since the very beginning and I have to say I am very impressed with where he is today and quite curious to see where his potential will take him tomorrow." - Edwin Jue Mentor edwinjue@gmail.com

Being paired with Ali for HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me was one of the more enjoyable partnerships I have had while at Turing. I admired Ali’s drive and determination thought out the project. He was very methodical about every step of the project. Ali’s strong suit is his problem solving logic. His excitement about the project caused us to stay and refactor late into the night. We turned in a very successful project mainly due to his attention to detail and work ethic. - Admir Draganovic

 Ali has been a constant source of encouragement to me - especially during my low points, which I had way too many during this module.  I found him to be inspiring especially during the projects.  Seeing him trudge on was a source of inspiration.  I also saw him grow as a coder, seeing as he was improving his skills over the course of the module.  Also, he has been a model of sacrifice: he took all of Thanksgiving to feed the indigent group; working at the Denver stock show, and has been able to keep his close relationships  intact during these intense 6 weeks.  I would hope that he would only grow in confidence in proportion to his growing skills.- Hedy Woo

Ali is one of my favorite people at Turing. We met a few weeks before the program started and decided to organize a study group together, along with Hedy Woo. We studied everyday for 2 weeks straight, and was the main reason that gave me the confidence to try out the Echo route in module 1. I know Ali was struggling in the beginning of the module so I tried to help him as much as I could. I definitely noticed a big change in his skills when we came back from Christmas break. It was clear to me that he studied hard all break. He was even helping me out on a few issues I was having with HTTP:YYKM. I believe Ali adds a lot to the Turing community by being a hard worker that is always willing to help those around him. I wish him nothing but the best of luck and success in the future! - Nick Dorans

"I’m going to keep this short and sweet. When I was super desperate and had to find a place to live during our break, he drove me around all day calling everybody he knew, reaching out to any connections he had to find me a place. He wouldn’t take no for an answer, actually inviting me to live at his home if I couldn’t find a place. He’s a solid dude, and its been great to have him in our class.” - Gurusundesh Khalsa

## Community

* Fed the homeless for thanksgiving....not part of a shelter or drive. I cooked 180 meals and drove around Denver Metro area passing out food to people who couldn't make it to the shelters. Also gave the womans shelter 80 dishes. dish was Roasted Chicken leg/thigh, mash potatoes, and roll.

* Provided Shelter Support.... As I fed the homeless, a lot of them would asked if I had a tarp for them to secure their items in rough weather. I decided to contact several different retail organizations and was able to secure 180 tarps which we handed out a few weeks before christmas.

* Volunteer with the Boys and Girls club / event management and fundraising for the holidays.

According to the Feedback application:


Hedy,

2 weeks prior to the beginning of cohort 1511. Nick Dorans, Hedy and I studied daily to try grasp a understanding of what we all were getting ourselves into. Hedy took the initiative and found fun challenging projects that tested our beginner skills to new levels. Her continuous never give up attitude and dedication throughout the module has help not only myself but many other 1511 students over the stress of confusion and feeling lost in the mist. Hedy is a great asset to our cohort and I look forward to her success, she will be a change maker in this industry!

Nick,

2 weeks prior to the beginning of cohart 1511. Hedi Woo, Nick and I studied daily to try to grasp a understanding of what we were all getting ourselves into. Speaking with Nick I was impress with his level of passion taking the knowledge that he learned with Pragmatic Studio’s and making a video game. If at any point we would get stuck during our daily studied sessions Nick wouldn’t hesitate to start probing around the internet for the answer. His passion and dedication to the success of his knowledge is seen everyday with his interactions in class and with his assistance of his peers. Nick will be a great developer.

Julian,

Is a well-rounded coder with the passion to gain more knowledge in this field as well as teach to others. He continuously challenges himself and those around to become better coders. By speaking with Julian you see his passion in not only code but his lifestyle to help others. I had the privilege of spending new years with Julian his girl-friend and Scott Firestone.  Julian is a well-rounded great guy and I am proud to call him a friend! I know he will not only be successful in this industry, but he will become a change-maker.

Scott

Marketable, outgoing, persuasive, and just a great guy to know! Scott takes code to a whole new level, making it more challenging and fun to learn. His approach and  thought process to code is super interesting. You can tell his people skills are great with the way he explains a question if you're stuck. Scott will adapt the explanation in multiple ways until he is adamant that you know it.  He is also a good-hearted person, recently buying Beanie’s for the homeless. It is a honor and privilege learning side by side with Scott and also gaining a friendship! I know his million-dollar idea will be the next billion-dollar idea.

Admir

I had the privilege and honor to have Admir as my partner on http-you-know-me project. His skill and approach our project was very impressive. We had the same goal, not to just succeed on our project but to show the skills that we have learned throughout our module. On a personal note, Admir passion is highly admired; the dedication that he has in this course and program goes way beyond just wanting to learn how to be a coder. He is a very respectable person who truly cares about not only his own success but about the person he pairs with. Admir and I stayed late every night, deleted and rewrote a bunch of code. But it was our dedication that gave us a +4 from Josh Cheek in a category and that is something I would not have been able to do without a great partner like Admir. I look forward to the opportunity to work with him again throughout our course.  I look forward to seeing his success in this field!

Gurusundesh,

Over Christmas break, I had the privilege to pair with Gurusundesh, his insight and perspective to coding is mind-boggling. His adaptation to many different scenarios and being able to view multiple different elements within the code was superb. Sunny is one of the most positive, good-hearted people I have ever met in my life. His approach to coding is the same in his everyday life. Taking challenges with a grain of rice and seeing all the positive outcomes of a frustrated situations. His positive demeanor and yes attitude has helped me and most  of our cohort out on frustrating days. Sunny is a team player, motivator and all around great coder who views code in multiple ways that is challenging for most people to see. I hope one day to have the adaptability my programing the same way that sunny has to his programing.


Deborah,

Throughout Module 1 I have had the opportunity to pair with Deborah  several times. Impressive is the best way to put it. Deborah’s approach is very clear and distinctive, she has the patience and dedication to practice until she is certain that she and the person she is pairing with have grasp the knowledge. I consider Deborah the cheerleader and motivator of cohort 1511. She is the first to offer assistance and reassurance to the success and belief in yourself.  Deborah has brought a ton of value to our cohort and I vote that she should be our student Liaison!

Matt DesMarteau,

I had the opportunity to pair with Matt several times throughout Module 1. His approach to code and learning is very impressive. He takes the time to make sure that he understands the problem before moving forward. The first time we paired, Matt iterated his passion by making sure we were both on the same page before moving into the next section. His determination in this program is superb and you see it everyday in his interaction with his peers. Matt approach with a never give up attitude has carried most of this cohort. He is always around when people need assistance and will always support you when you’re lost. I look forward to his success throughout this program and in his career. I know Matt will change the way the coding environment is with his passion and determination!
