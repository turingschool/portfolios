### M3 Mission

I will prove to myself that I can do as well on individual projects as I have in groups and become more efficient in learning new things on my own. I want to build a production ready app that solves a real problem that is something I am proud to place on my resume.

### Feedback

#### Received

>**Adrienne Domingus**  "Great pairing experience with Brian. He showed an impressive commitment to learning throughout the project, actively seeking to take on parts of the project he wasn't sure he knew how to do and asking questions, and showed a lot of growth. Brian was also very responsive to all communication and generous with his time to make sure everyone on the team had what they needed to move forward. One thing he could work on is his comfort in researching and finding what he is looking for in documentation, and being willing to try brand new things independently, even if we hadn't been taught."

#### Given

>**Brian Rippeto** "Adrienne is a coding machine with a sense of humor to boot. I can honestly say that she is the most driven developer I have paired with and has the smarts to compliment her work ethic. Her red green refactor coding habits are excellent. She does not get caught up in ambivalence when writing tests or making them pass the first time around and has the refactoring skills to compliment her aptitude for production. My suggestion for Adrienne is to maintain her tenacity but exercise patience to write robust tests before diving in. "

### Being a Community Member  

* Started Turing Fitness and regularly encouraged classmates to come running and socialize after school. I was able to make some meaningful connection with classmates through being active together.

* Served on SAB and found it to be great experience to see how much effort Turing puts into making the school genuinely about the learning and life experience of the students. I will continue on SAB for the remainder of MOD.

* Took part in the hackathon and contributed to my team having a Pull Request excepted to exercism.io for a new API endpoint.

* Made a consistent effort reach out to classmates and encourage them in times of stress and I appreciate the same support in return.
