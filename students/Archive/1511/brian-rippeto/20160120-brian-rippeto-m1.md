# Brian Rippeto - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My module goal is to learn Ruby as my first programming language and discover if this is a career field that I can truly be passionate about. I want to test my problem solving abilities when faced with the unknown and discover if I have what it takes to adapt and overcome in programming as I have in other areas of life. I plan to carry my passion as a design/build carpenter into building software.

### Module 2 Goals

My evaluation notes

Minimum one technical blog post

Weekly mentor sessions

Self-solicited continual and consistent feedback

Posse challenges

Not evaluated projects: Sinatra CRUD, Tool Chest, Mix Master, Rails Mini,

Evaluated Projects: Traffic Spy, Little Shop

Assessments: mid-module, final

__Personal Goals:__

* Front range community involvement once per weeks
* Find a local mentor
* Style my git.io site into something I am proud of
* Find a creative extension to each group project


### End of Module Assessment

Assessor: Jeff Casimir

### Notes

* Working on Player Tracking with Jeff
* Little bit of an odd/rough start with testing writing the assertion before the method wrapper
* Try not to look ahead too much into what's coming next
* Seem to have some speedbumps with object instantiation and the conceptual understandings therein
* Some good keyboard shortcuts, though they feel a little fresh
* Overusing the technique of `SomeClass.new.method` when it doesn't really fit, but can sort it out
* Practice keeping your head up while typing, especially the non-letters
* Doing better after some warmup

#### 2. Ruby Style

* __3__: Developer refactors for clarity but has some areas for improvement

#### 3. Testing

* __3__: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* __3__: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* __3__: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


### Attendance

Attended all required classes and activities.

### Work

The following are individual projects in chronological order:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brianrip/linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Linked list of Jungle Beats Project emphasized understanding of linked lists through iteration and/or recursion. Program played beats on the command line and included features like append, prepend, insert, pop and find.

Project was incomplete but the code for the linked list showed that the developer has a good understanding of the concepts but needs more practice sharpening their ruby tools.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brianrip/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Encryption/decryption machine. Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Assessed By: Meeka

__Comments:__

 Brian had a good understanding of the app and was able to display all pry functionality but was not able to do the decypting/encrypting/cracking in a file. He had a decent amount of repetition in his code, but I felt the repetiion was there to try and make his code readable and understandable. He was able to understand my refactoring suggestions, and I suggested he read POODR over the break - as I felt his weaknesses were in code repetition and improved testing fundamentals.

## Team

### Projects

The following are team projects:

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

**Partner:** Alex Navarette

**Instructor:** Meeka

**Repo Url:** https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me

**Original Assignment:** https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

Web server capable of requesting and responding, parsing paths, and preforming word search operations with parameters. Also, the first project to incorporate pairing and partner design.


__Comments:__

* Got some of game implemented but not all of it completed.
* Keep an eye out for splitting code by endpoint.
Really nice usage of named method. Follow your gut and keep reading POODR to refactor many arguments being passed to methods, as you brought up in the eval!
* Remember to test unhappy or edgecase paths - like ?word='' or ?word=PIZZA or ?word=plu. Very nice work on working around using Hurley. Server should have (unskipped) tests.
* Good job on breaking larger methods into human readable pieces like here. As said above, think about splitting things into responsibility, endpoints, etc. Here is an excellent example that should be split out.

__Scores:__

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* TDD: 4

#### Black Thursday

**Partner:** Adam Hundley

**Instructor:** Horace

**Repo Url:** https://github.com/adamhundley/black_thursday

**Original Assignment:** https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown

__Comments:__

* so many tests
* completion through I4
* great analysis code; could still be improved by pushing more of the
graph traversal logic and various query methods into the individual record objects
* this would simplify our enumerable problems since we could just call an existing
method rather than having to do more calculations within each block
* a few small ruby style things here and there -- e.g. multiline blocks with {} vs.
do/end etc
* boatload of tests; they run quickly; ultimately would have liked to see some means of
customizing the data without changing csv files

__Scores:__

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3

### Giving Feedback

####  Feedback for Alex Navarette

Alex was a fun partner to work with. Being able to laugh at yourself while stressed can make or break those tough moments and I was grateful that Alex had that quality. He demonstrated solid use of pry as a debugging technique. He also has a solid grasp on his ruby fundamentals and demonstrates good testing habits.

#### Feedback for Matt Packer

I enjoyed the calm collected thoughts Matt delivered as we navigated through an assignment that was tough for both of us. When stuck on a problem he vocalizes ideas for a new approach instead of projecting discouragement. Like many of us at this stage in our learning process, Matt would benefit from having more confidence in his abilities and solutions.

#### Feedback for Charles Ellison

Charles was very receptive to feedback while refactoring his final project. His enthusiasm for programming is apparent and motivating. I also appreciated the clarity which he expressed his ideas.

#### Feedback for Adam Hundley

Adam approaches problems with confidence that is contagious. Half the battle in programming is believing you can solve a problem, and with Adam, I never had a doubt we would pull through. His ability to troubleshoot from different angles helped us to always keep momentum on our project. He possesses great ruby style and debugging techniques. Sometimes his strength of tenacity could work against him. Respect the "pomodoro".

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback 1

“I have been able to work with Brian over the last 2 weeks on our Black Thursday project and it has been a true pleasure. I have a tendency to try to fly through things and not practice TDD very well, but Brian has the ability to pull the reigns back and dive in on small increments. It pushes you to write better code as well as give a better understanding of single responsibility in programming. His calm demeanor is a peach at the battle station." - Adam Hundley

#### Feedback 2

“Brian would make an excellent contribution to any team. He clearly communicates his understanding of the problem at hand, while providing a possible solution; this helps the team gain consensus before implementing a solution. I found his approach helpful both in overcoming challenges and debugging testing errors. I am confident that Brain will continue to develop his workflow by utilizing additional keyboard shortcuts." - Matthew Packer

#### Feedback 3

"I never really knew Brian that well until we were partnered up for our HTTP Yeah You Know me project. It was interesting because I found myself teaching Brian new ways on approaching problems when it came to our project. I also like the fact how he is always aware when it is time to stop struggling and ask for help. That is something I noticed I personally lacked myself before getting to know him better. Overall, I'm glad that he was a cool partner to be paired up with over a difficult project that was new to both of us. So for that, I thank him for making it possible for both of us to turn in a successful project even when we were struggling to get passed Iteration 0 for a couple days."- Alex Navarrete

### Playing a Part
* made a consistent effort to reach out to students from other modules
* encouraged my posse to meet up in the morning
* spent half an hour talking with a prospective Turing student
* made coffee 5 times throughout the module when I noticed it was empty
* attended the Job search/Resume building seminar with Ian Douglas
* attended optional Improv class on one occasion and hope to continue attending
