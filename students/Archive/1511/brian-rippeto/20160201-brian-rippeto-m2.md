# Brian Rippeto - M2 Portfolio


### Your Mission

My module 2 mission is to find myself more confident as a developer and expand my learning beyond required coursework. My hope is that as my workflow and general knowledge improves I can dedicate time toward going beyond what is expected to pass the module. I really want to come into and accept this career change as something real and toss aside the lurking notion that I can't do this. Technically, I want to explore front-end engineering as a possible career path.

### Personal Goals

* Style my git.io site into something I am proud of
* Typing practice 30 minutes a day
* Find a creative extension to each group project
* Front range community involvement once per week
* Find a local mentor
* Pair with a Module 1 student bi-weekly
* Take time to connect with other students on a personal level by improving my listening and cultivating more sincere interest outside of myself

## Feedback

### Giving feedback

#### Feedback for Charles Ellison

"Chad is someone I always look forward to pairing with for a number of reasons. First of all, he has an inherit passion for programming that is contagious. It doesn’t feel so much like work but an exciting new challenge every time we dig into a problem. He communicates clear and concise ideas that are able to be built upon. Also, he absorbs others input efficiently. He is always open to try new workflow tactics which is reflective of his willingness to grow as programmer and person.”

#### Feedback for Kimiko Kano

 “After successfully completing a week long project with Kimi I can say that she is a very competent programmer. Her ability to quickly google implementable solutions was impressive. She was the team lead on the project and she did a great job making sure we all figured out how to use waffle.io in a useful manner. She brings a great sense of humor to the table and my only suggestion would be to maintain that awesome sense of humor when the stress of a difficult problem becomes overwhelming. She will make a great asset to any team."

#### Feedback for Brennan Holtzclaw

 “Brennan was a pleasure to work with throughout the project. It should be noted that in the course of a week Brennan dealt with a crippling flu and broken phone without complaining at all. He showed up and did his part. His demeanor when exploring solutions was always open and encouraging which made for a solid team dynamic. I noticed there were a few times that Brennan had ideas brewing that we didn’t explore. I would recommend him being a more assertive in expressing his ideas, even if he isn’t completely clear on if they will work. Brennan’s ruby style was excellent and I’m sure it will carry over into Rails and beyond."

#### Feedback for Heidi Hoopes

 “I had the opportunity to collaborate with Heidi for the first time on our Little Shop e-commerce App. She was essential in setting up the factories that allowed for seamless test setup throughout the project. Heidi has a keen attention to detail that makes her great at refactoring and debugging. She always completed the tasks she took on in a timely fashion. Heidi could benefit from setting up her bash profile and implementing more of a red green approach to produce functional code before delving to far into detailed refactoring. I was also impressed that Heidi manages to raise three children while staying on top of her work and showing up everyday with a smile.”

#### Feedback for July Tran

 "July brought our group an awesome and humorous idea for our little shop project which speaks volume to the creativity and good sense of humor she brings to a team. She grasps new ideas quickly and is takes a methodical approach to writing her tests that I have made a point to emulate. I was also impressed by how involved she is in meaningful community causes while still making time to flourish in this difficult program. At times, July could benefit from describing her ideas in fashion that is more patient and open to questions.”

### Receiving feedback:

#### Feedback from Charles Ellison

"During the module Brian and I paired several times to practice CRUD functionality. A few of the things that make Brian a great collaborator are his solid workflow and process tackling a problem. Every time I have worked with Brian, I have learned new keyboard shortcuts. He is also very good at navigating his way through unfamiliar material. His decisions about how much time to spend on a problem and what to focus on made our pairing sessions very productive. Brian’s lightheartedness and positive attitude also made debugging an enjoyable process as well as a learning experience."

#### Feedback from Kimiko Kano

 "I worked with Brian on the week-long Rush Hour project. Brian has a very positive and easy-going demeanor, so he was great to work with. I also enjoyed our pullup and pushup pomodoros. One piece of feedback that I gave him while we were working together was that when refactoring he should be a little more careful in making changes one step at a time and running tests in between each change instead of trying to do it all at once. Hopefully this will prevent time in debugging after the fact. Overall, I think our project pairing went well and I think we all learned a lot from each other!"

#### Feedback from Brennan Holtzclaw

 "I hadn't worked with, or really talked to, Brian before this project. Now that I have, I'm sad it took so long. Brian did a great job of keeping us on track, stopping rabbit holes when we got a little lost, and staying positive, even when we were incredibly stuck. I think Brian would really gain from being more confident. He does a good job at tracing errors and correcting bugs, but lack of confidence sometimes means he doesn't write the code to get there in the first place. Getting more code on the screen and running tests more often would probably speed up his process, and be a big help to those around him. I would be glad to work with Brian on another project. I might even be able to do a single pull-up by then."

#### Feedback from July Tran

"Brian is a very thoughtful thinker and flexible person. I appreciate his ability to carefully consider all the ways of approaching a problem and his openness to exploration. His ability to adapt and his fun, supportive personality make him a great partner. I think Brian would benefit from taking a full TDD approach, as he has a tendency to implement features before completing the writing of a test. I also think Brian could have more confidence in his skills and ideas, as they are something to be proud of. I've noticed Brian's git workflow improve through this project as well and am sure they will continue to improve as he matures as a developer. I'm very glad to have Brian as a colleague. "

#### Feedback from Heidi Hoopes

"I worked with Brian on a Rails storefront as a defining project of our second instructional module. Brian is a responsible teammate who has a solid approach to problem solving and attempting new methods. He seems to incorporate new ideas from every learning situation. He could work on his communication by being more assertive in situations where he is convinced in his understanding of an idea, but his easy-going nature is also a plus overall."

## Evaluated Projects

### Little Shop

#### Team: July Tran & Brian Rippeto & Heidi Hoopes

#### Assessed By:Andrew

#### Notes:

* When checking out if you go back without paying, cart is empty and no other way to pay for gif. Maybe drop a payment option in the orders page.
* Some logic is leaking through in the views. Saw a formatted price, and a map for a collection dropdown box. An unnecessary variable in a path helper. Some alignment issues when items are retired. This issue is related to a conditional in the itteration of gifs.
* In controllers some room for POROS - but generally skinny and good code. Want to look into orders_controller update for the quantity variable


#### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

#### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

#### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

#### 4. Models

* 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

#### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

#### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

#### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### My Little Shop evaluation notes:

* view on charity index should have buttons on same height
* order of div tag/if condition might fix the empty hole, or we can just scope the gifs to active
* charity dropdown menu in creating a gif, pass the mapped charities instead
* gif creator PORO
* quantity update method for gif
* gif creator would have the create tags method since it doesn’t belong in Gif
* subdirectories for integration test
* admin creates tag test shouldn’t use helper methods if you are “hiding” some of the information

### Traffic Spy

#### Team: Kimiko Kano & Brian Rippeto & Brennan Holtzclaw

#### Assessed By:Andrew

#### Notes:
* Styling is good. Ui works and flows.
* Be careful of little things like variable names being explicit.
* Good scoping in feature tests. Need to focus on dynamic data not static info.
* Some view handling in the parser helper




### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### My Rush Hour evaluation notes:

* Good style, ui flow and functionality

* Make tests more explicit in naming variables

* beef up validation tests

* If we have table specific queries, have the methods live within tables respective model

* Relationship testing-user active record calls. Example: payload.request_type.verb vs. RequestType.find(1).verb

* Query dynamic values in capybara tests

* Make feature tests interactive

* Write an acceptance test that touches all of the application

#### Encapsulation

* Push logic down the stack. Controllers > Models

* Use find_by instead of where for active record queries

* Don’t abbreviate - BE explicit

#### Ruby

* Keep formatting in model

#### Workflow

* Make comments on merge approvals
* Be explicit in commit messages
* Good initial familiarization of Activerecord.
