# Brian Rippeto - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I plan to strengthen my JavaScript skills to point of employability. I also plan on researching companies and either having a few solid leads on jobs or knowing a list of companies that I wish to pursue upon graduation. I should spin up a few rails apps and do some work with ActiveRecord queries and DB performance to stay fresh on those skills.

### Feedback

#### Received

>**David Whitaker** “I had the opportunity to pair with Brian on our game time project.  He has a unique ability to think outside the box in approaching problems.  There was a point where our collision detection wasn’t working for our bottom boundary and I tried a ton of things to fix it.  Brian quickly thought to randomize the y instead of the height for those bottom boundary objects, and vuala it was fixed.  I also really appreciated his commitment and focus on testing during the project.  I’m confident that he’ll be a valuable member at whatever team he ends up on."

>**Chelsea Johnson** “I thoroughly enjoyed working with Brian on the Lookingfor project. He was able to help the group reach a consensus during several decision points. He always completed the cards he took on and helped others to complete theirs. Any dev team would be lucky to have Brian in their corner!"

#### Given

>**David Whitaker** “I had the opportunity to work with David on our GameTIme project. We quickly found a comfortable flow pairing together and bouncing ideas back and forth. I attribute this to David’s strong ability to collaborate and communicate his technical skills. He delivered on every feature he chose to tackle and took on issues that involved tech stacks he had never used before. David is a solid teammate and problem solver."
