# Charissa - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Consuming API's was exciting for me and seemed to open up a whole new world of programming capabilities. My goal was to get as comfortable as possible with the aspect of consuming 3rd party api's.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

Projects this module consisted of consuming api's, serving our own api's, and utilizing relationship models through activeRecord.

#### Personal Project - Are they okay

* [https://github.com/JaggedLaw/are_they_okay.git](https://github.com/JaggedLaw/are_they_okay.git)
* [Original Assignment]()

For my personal project I decided to create an app to fill a missing piece of the puzzle regarding mental health. There should be more resources for friends and family members who may be concerned that someone they know is suffering from a mental health issue but is not getting treatment. I gathered my own data through research so that I could serve a results page based on answers to various survey questions. On the results page will also be a list of podcast related to the survey results so that the user can gain additional information and support... the list is based on consumption of the Audiosear.ch podcast api.

#### RalesEngine

* [https://github.com/JaggedLaw/RailsEngine.git](https://github.com/JaggedLaw/RailsEngine.git)
* [Original Assignment]()

RalesEngine involved serving up our own api. We imported several csv files of various invoice data and were able to serve them in json using various filters for displaying interesting data.

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* *2: Project completes most requirements but fails 10 to 6 spec harness tests.*

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* *1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.*

**2. Code Quality**

* *3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.*

**3. API Design**

* *3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.*

**4. Queries**

* *4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.*
* 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.
* 2: Project has some gaps in ActiveRecord usage, including numerous business methods that rely on ruby enumerables to find the appropriate data.
* 1: Project struggles to establish a coherent ActiveRecords schema, including missing relationships or dysfunctional queries.

#### API Curious

* [https://github.com/JaggedLaw/APICurious_github.git](https://github.com/JaggedLaw/APICurious_github.git)
* [Original Assignment]()

This was the first project of the module which involved consuming a 3rd party api and mimicking their site. In my case I used the github API and created a page which highlighted other users git submissions, starred repos, followers, etc.

## Team

Kimi, Nick Weiland, myself, and later added 2 ppl to the team: Lenny and Brennan Holzclaw

### Projects

The Pivot project involved taking over a completed project from the previous module, and adding multi-tenancy with various user permissions.

### Notes:

- Remember to buy Nate a big hat
- Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
- Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
- Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

### Giving Feedback

Charissa has been a great addition to 1511 and I was able to see how she touched so many in the Turing community as well. After The Pivot pivot I got plopped onto a team with her, and I was really pleased to see how well she seemed to handle the shake-up. Charissa is incredibly quiet most of the time, which had me worried about team communication at first, but I quickly learned it wouldn’t be a problem. When she had a question she’d be quick to ask, and I felt comfortable bringing code her way when I got stuck. She was a great team player, and is definitely someone I want to work with again soon. On top of all that, Charissa’s lightning talk was a touching tribute, and actually spoke to a real problem in our society. That doesn’t happen much in those silly 5 minute speeches. I think she is going to have great ideas, and do big things in module 4 and especially in the world outside the basement. - Brennan Holtzclaw

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Brennan and I got to work together at first under not the best of circumstances. It was a pivot on the pivot and he was being thrown into a new codebase in the middle of a project. I was totally impressed with how he took on the project as seamlessly as possible. As a group we came together to make the best of it and turned in a great project in the end. It was an excellent group project experience thanks to his calm demeanor and capabilities. - Charissa Lawrence

### Being a Community Member

I participated in our Turing all day hack-a-thon. My team used an idea I had come up with which involved creating a word game into an interactive app. 
As a member of the Ritchie posse we met to discuss out members current code challenges and come up with solutions as a team to posse challenges.

### Playing a Part

This module I was not able to spend as much time as I wanted in this area due to familial circumstances that I needed to handle.
