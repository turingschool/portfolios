# David Whitaker: Module 3
____
## Individual

### Your Mission

This module was one that I was very intimidated going into and it has turned out to be my favorite module by far.  I've really enjoyed the freedom to tackle issues that I'm interested in.  My goal going into the module was to feel confident as a job ready rails developer and I feel like I've accomplished that.

### Final Assessment

**Assessed By:**  Josh Mejia

#### Challenge

3 hour assessment to build and consume an internal API and work with the Best Buy external API. Skills required include manipulation of all parts of the Rails stack, including Ruby and Active Record, with strong emphasis on TDD and regular github interaction.  

#### Assessment Comments  
* API response is not customized to remove created_at or updated_at
* API functionality is solid
* Having an `all` and `all_by_long` is unnecessary
* Good use of POROs

#### Scores:
  - Ruby Style and Syntax  
    3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components  

  - Rails Syntax & API  
    3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.  

  - Testing  
    3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.  

  - Progression/Completion
    3.5
    4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
    3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

  - Workflow   
    4: Developer commits every 15 minutes

### Feedback

>**Erinna Chen** "I’ve always really admired Erinna’s willingness to help anyone in trouble.  Whether she’s working on your team or not and no matter how much time she has, she always seems to be willing to go out of her way to look at any issues your having and put out a fire if need be.  She is an extremely talented programmer and is great at staying cool under pressure.  I think that she could benefit from delegating more to her team members as I worry that she sometimes has too much on her plate.  I would love to work with her again."

>**Adam Hundley** "Adam is a really talented developer with a strong drive.  I really admire his work ethic and fearlessness in tackling new challenges.  We spend a lot of time working with one another and I always appreciate his opinion and get a ton of benefit from bouncing ideas off of him.  I also look forward to staying friends after turing and hope that we can continue to push each other as programmers too.  I think that sky’s the limit for his abilities and I look forward to seeing what the future holds."  

>**Chelsea Johnson** "I had a really great experience working with Chelsea on the_pivot.  She is a strong programmer who is able to come up with really cool, creative solutions to problems.  I’d like to challenge her to use more active record and javascript as she seems very comfortable with ruby.  I would love to work with Chelsea again as she is a ton of fun to work with and writes great code.  Also, if theres one thing I know, if she it’s her birthday, IT’S MY BIRTHDAY TOO! Danceadoros for life!"

>**Julian** "Julian is one of my go to guys.  He has an amazing attitude toward both life and programming.  I feel like he does things the right when approaching how he programs.  He is amazing at tdd and has inspired me to read Testing Rails in my free time to try to get near his level.  I also really appreciate that he is always willing to help folks when they’re struggling as he’s done for me many times(the guys js game is ridiculous).  He’s an excellent friend and resource to have and I hope that I get the opportunity to work with him more!"

### Being a Community Member  

Contributed to exercism.io for the hackathon and created a new endpoint for user data that we used in the brin posse app.

I attended 3 environmental variables   meetings this module and contributed to the effort of making turing a more environmentally friendly organization.

I taught a git flow class to mod1 students to help clear up any git related insecurities or issues.

Consistently put out fires for students in lower modules.

I have gone to a couple of events outside of school this module.  One was the Built in Colorado job fair at the lobby and another was a job fair at the commons.

### Posse Takeaways

Being in the Brin posse I have done probably twice as many exercisms this module than the first two modules combined.  It's been a huge help in keeping up on my ruby skills and problem solving.

>“David is a great programmer to have on your team. He's by far one of the most positive people I have worked with, and even under stress that does not change. I really respect his communication style; he clearly expresses what he knows and what he doesn't know. David should work on just expanding his technical skills, but I believe that will come with time. I would work with David pretty much on anything at this point."  **Erinna Chen**

>"David is one of my go to guys. Whenever I have a question, problem or need an opinion, David is there to lend a hand. He is turing into a great developer. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."  **Adam Hundley**  


>"I had a lot of fun working with David on the Pivot. His optimism and enthusiasm made the project much more enjoyable. He was not daunted by implementing new concepts and produced really solid code. And most of all, I enjoyed our Danceadoros! I don't have any constructive feedback really, keep it up Damwhit!"  **Chelsea Johnson**


>"If there was a poster child for the phrase "glass half full" David would be it. From day one to the end of this module he has kept the same even keel attitude that everyday is a great day. As a developer, he embraces all challenges thrown his way and is never afraid to ask questions when in need. His greatest strength is his ability to quickly pick up on a solution with just a little bit of context. I'm always like to leave a bit of constructive feedback, but in the case of David he had handled himself at Turing with aplomb! Keep on keeping on dude!"  **Julian Feliciano**
