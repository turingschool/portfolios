### Projects

Below is a list of all project and assessment scores from Module 2.

#### Little Shop

Assessed By: Rachel

##### Notes:

* Testing could be much better. Plenty of feature tests but need more model tests to fully cover code. Don'y rely on simplecov.
* Security flaw with users viewing other orders

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4+
* Views: 4
* Controllers: 3.5
* Models: 4
* Testing: 3
* Usability: 4
* Workflow: 3


#### Traffic Spy


Assessed By Rachel

##### Notes:

All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existance. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

### Giving Feedback

>**Alex** "I was really impressed with your work ethic throughout Rush Hour. I think some areas for improvement include making your workflow more seamless and becoming more confident in your ability to research, test and implement solutions to problems that come up by exploring documentation.  Also, I think you have some really great ideas and some of those ideas got steam-rolled throughout the project because of a lack of buy-in from the group and/or time constraints.  I think it would have been great if you took some of this ideas and put them into action and then demonstrated what you did as leverage for implementing into the project. Bias toward action.  Keep it up man."

>**Chelsea** “It was really great working with you and Alex on Rush Hour.  I think your future groups and future teams could really benefit from you speaking up more frequently in pairing sessions and being more assertive and vocal with project decisions.  I’d be happy to role play these situations with you if you’d like.   I was really impressed with your feature tests and your implementation of the Rush Hour sha encryption."

>**Marina** “I’ve seen such an awesome improvement in both your Ruby skill and confidence this module. All the times I worked with you over the past few weeks I was super impressed with your workflow and ruby logic.  I recommend continuing to reinforce your understanding how your code gets processed, similar to how we broke down the recursion  that was taking place in Bubble Sort on paper. You’re going to rock Mod 2!"

>**Ilana** “You have been an awesome addition to the Goldberg Posse. I feel like you're always positive and ready to work on Posse Challenges whenever time is scheduled.  Also, working with you on Ruby has been really fun and I look forward to more Posse Challenges next module.  In order to improve pairing sessions, I recommend getting to know your workflow super well and studying shortcuts/creating snippets to  make recurring tasks feel seamless.  Keep up the great work!"

>**Adam** "Working with Adam and David on Little Owl was an awesome experience because it was the first time I’ve worked on a projects where our workflow was like a functioning team rather than a pairing session. I was impressed with Adam’s skill and reliability as our project progressed, but these are things I already knew.  What was really impressive was his impact on the team culture.  It was super fun working with him and I know the soft skills that make him a great teammate will be a huge asset in whatever he does after Turing.  I know we’re supposed sandwich the bad with the good, but there is really nothing constructive I can think of. Oh, wait, get rid of your transparent terminal."

>**David** "Working with Adam and David on Little Owl was an awesome experience because it was the first time I’ve worked on a projects where our workflow was like a functioning team rather than a pairing session. I was super impressed with David's skill from the beginning, especially with his ability to recall design patterns that I was still referencing past project or Rails docs to create. Although not a core objective of this program, it would be great to see David improve upon his front-end design over Mod 3 because he seemed to be really interested. I'd be stoked to work with him again."

### Being a Community Member

>"I really enjoyed working with Nick on RushHour. He excels at problem solving and really drove our progress in the project. He has a solid understanding of ActiveRecord, demonstrates good Ruby style, and has a solid understanding of styling. Occasionally I felt Alex and I were "left in the dust" on the project because Nick had a better understanding of the concepts. However, Nick was always happy to explain his code."-**Chelsea**

>"Honestly, I really don’t think there is anything I can really say as feedback for you since it always seems like you’re on point with what the challenges are. Other than that I really appreciate both of the times we ended up pairing up with both Rush Hour and the Mini Rails project that has been very valuable for me. Just analyzing how to react to certain solutions that seem so complex and finding the answers to it is very facisnating. I also appreciate how you would make all those shortcuts in order to make the workflow faster when it comes to implementing projects."-**Alex**

>"Nick took charge to complete posse challenges and would regularly be available for pairing. Being new to the style of the challenges, Nick was able to help me break down the problems into manageable solutions and together, we were able to work through portions of the challenges. I think that Nick is great at explaining concepts that seem complex as well."-**Ilana**

>"This is the second time I have paired with Nick on a project. Nick’s passion for programming is only outdone by his SKILL in programming. I have never worked with someone who grasps concepts as quickly as Nick. His fearless diving head in to problems is inspiring. He will see a problem or something he wants to implement and instead of saying “wow that looks hard,” his immediate response is to figure it out. No matter how hard. I look forward to more projects with Nick and hope to have the opportunity to continue to work with him even after finishing Turing."-**Adam**

>"I had the chance to pair with Nick on Little Owl.  His vision from the beginning of the the project forward was truly inspiring.  When we sat down the first day Adam and I both were extremely impressed that he aspired to make a website for little owl coffee across the street.  His attention to detail in both design and code is brilliant as well as his ability to instill confidence in his teammates.  There were multiple points during the project where Nick would seek out new, interesting challenges with contagious enthusiasm.  I hope that some of that enthusiastic fearlessness has rubbed off on me.  I really hope to work with him again!"-**David**

>"I’ve had the chance to get to know Nick well this module.  We went to DC together for the Teach for America summit and we pair pretty consistently for Goldberg Posse challenges.  Nick has a passion for coding that is admirable.  He codes everyday and has an amazing ability to think about projects in a big way and their impact to users. I’ve grown a good deal as a developer because of our pairings and his help for both these modules"-**Marina**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Continued to run Hack Design on Thursdays at lunch. Led student session on Design Thinking that may take place every other week.
* I worked with Deb Hamel 4/6 weeks on Fridays to go over Ruby by completing Exercisms.

### Notes: 

* Goals were roughly attained 
* Still wants to get more competant at JS
* Blog posts are valuable 
* Met with Mentor
* Working on little shop was a good experience - good to get in the flow
* Good partner - people like workign with you.
* Have a good eye for insight
* Experienced with soft skills - trying to learn as much as possible as fast as possible so sometimes the feedback is that you 'steamroll' others. Just DTR that


### Outcome 

Pass
