### Feedback to Group Members

#### Feedback to David Whitaker
I had a lot of fun working with David on the Pivot. His optimism and enthusiasm made the project much more enjoyable. He was not daunted by implementing new concepts and produced really solid code. And most of all, I enjoyed our Danceadoros! I don't have any constructive feedback really, keep it up Damwhit!

#### Feedback to Erinna Chen
Erinna was a boss on our pivot project. She had to stamp out numerous fires started by David and myself. She also took the time to explain unfamiliar concepts to group members. At the beginning of the project, I interpreted Erinna's tone as slightly condescending when I asked for her opinion. However, this tone went away completely as the project progressed. I know she has been working on this, and it shows! Keep it up Erinna, you're awesome!


#### Feedback to Heidi Hoopes
I love my nerd sister! Not only is she an extremely talented developer, but she is also kind, caring, and optimistic. I have enjoyed being a posse leader with her and look forward to serving with her next module. When developing, she is not afraid of taking on challenges and seeks elegant solutions to her problems. Heidi is always thinking of others, and also takes time to volunteer for Kids Who Code and other Turing events. Heidi- you rock, and I am proud to call you my friend!

### Peer Feedback

#### Erinna Chen Notes
I would say I did not know Chelsea very well before working with her on the pivot, and working with her was a different experience than I thought it would be. She has great insight into the code she writes and is far more serious than I thought she would be.

I think Chelsea's process in tackling something new is to freak out about the complexity. I think she should trust her abilities more and drive development more with testing because it would allow her to tackle the smaller parts of a problem (and the edge cases) without worrying too much about how large a problem could be.

I'm not sure we really want to re-visit the pivot, but I would love to pair more with Chelsea. There is always excitement and dance parties to look forward to.

#### David Whitaker Notes
I had a really great experience working with Chelsea on the_pivot.  She is a strong programmer who is able to come up with really cool, creative solutions to problems.  I’d like to challenge her to use more active record and javascript as she seems very comfortable with ruby.  I would love to work with Chelsea again as she is a ton of fun to work with and writes great code.  Also, if theres one thing I know, if she it’s her birthday, IT’S MY BIRTHDAY TOO! Danceadoros for life!


#### Heidi Hoopes Notes
Chelsea is the perfect ally to have on a project. She architected the mission for the posse that we co-led this module and was always organized, on-time, and engaging. She has both the patience and direction to lead the junior students which the posse attracted, but also the technical chops to do whatever is required. I love seeing her projects because they're always fun, inspired, and technically challenging. This paragraph is shifting in and out of past and present tense because Chelsea is a bonafide developer for all ages. I enjoy being able to work with Chelsea and hope I get more chances in the future!

## Evaluated Projects

### The Pivot

Evaluated by: Josh M.

Repo: https://github.com/damwhit/the_pivot

Notes:

- Worked through learning goals successfully. A little light on features relative to other groups. Seems like soft skills are the reason why and not so much technical reasons. Would love for each group member to make a special effort to monitor their process for future projects this module. Good use of Waffle and Github. Great use of testing.

## Community Participation

I have become more active in various Turning groups, including Joan Clarke, imposters lunch, and environmental variables. I am also helping to plan the end-of-module LAN party and have served as a co-leader in the Miyamoto posse.

### Self-Review

#### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* **4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment**
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

#### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* **3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory**
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.
* 1: Student does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

#### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.
* **3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.**
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams.

#### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.
* **3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.**
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities (demos, lightning talks, etc)
but does not do anything else of significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses just on their own learning.

#### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.
* **3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.**
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive.
