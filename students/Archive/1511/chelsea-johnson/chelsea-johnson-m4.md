# Chelsea Johnson - M4 Portfolio

[Points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lZHyWBkwzn5txsN7ug2fUZ2Z6g1aa0rHDcxlmGVLV5s/edit#gid=0)

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I want to become a JS slayer and learn JS frameworks. I also want to start the job search and get all my job search docs in order. 

### Posse Work

* [Miyamoto Repo](https://github.com/cheljoh/miyamoto)

### Feedback to Group Members

#### Feedback to July
July Tran is one bodacious babe. In a zombie, apocalypse, I would hope that July would be in my tribe. She is fearless, dedicated, and one heck of a programmer. I am excited to see where she goes in life. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if she is a CTO by 30. She is a great leader, and has accomplished a lot with the Pahlka posse. I am happy to call July a friend!

#### Feedback to Kimi
Kimi was a rockstar on our Lookingfor front end project. Several times during the project, we would work on solving a problem without much success. Kimi would work on the problem overnight, and have a well-written PR the next morning. Her determination is not only evident in her code; it also applies to all areas of her life. For example, Kimi and I decided to arm wrestle (as you do). After several minutes of stalemate, I realized Kimi was not going to give up and I would have to be the chump that lost (and I definitely did). Any team would be lucky to have a solid developer like Kimi. Go Kimi!!!


#### Feedback to Heidi
I have really enjoyed getting to know Heidi. Not only is she an extremely talented developer, but she is also kind, caring, and optimistic. I have enjoyed being a posse leader with her and have learned a lot pairing with her. When developing, she is not afraid of taking on challenges and seeks elegant solutions to her problems. Heidi is always thinking of others; she takes time to volunteer for Kids Who Code and helped with a micro posse this module. Heidi is going to do a great job in her student support role at Turing!

### Peer Feedback

#### July Feedback
Working with Chelsea on GO GO NYAN CAT was my ultimate GameTime dream come true. She was immensely fun to work with and we had a blast in addition to sharpening our JS skillz. I really appreciate that Chelsea is always open to feedback and acts on it immediately. She also is so super dedicated to her work - she will let no bug go un-squashed and no feature remain incomplete. Though this is one of her strong suits, it could also be a downfall when the best thing you can do to be productive is to take a break - she would benefit from learning to honor the pomodoro. Additionally, she may benefit from becoming more comfortable with tooting her own horn and asserting herself in the hustle of life (but also jobs). Chelsea would be a tremendous asset to any team and I look forward to hearing more about her badassery.

#### Kimi Feedback
This was my first time working with Chelsea and it was an amazing experience. She was great at getting endpoints pushed through for Looking For either by communicating with the backend to get it done or more often, just deciding to do it herself and not worry about waiting around for someone else to finish it. This persistence to get things done is a great quality to have and she'll be well suited for her first dev job! In addition to her hard work ethic she's always a smiling and happy person, so she's just plain great to be around.


#### Heidi Feedback
Chelsea is the perfect ally to have on a project. She architected the mission for the posse that we co-led this module and was always organized, on-time, and engaging. She has both the patience and direction to lead the junior students which the posse attracted, but also the technical chops to do whatever is required. I love seeing her projects because they're always fun, inspired, and technically challenging. She will make a responsible yet dashingly fun addition to a team. Go cheljoh go!

## Community Participation

I am active in various Turning groups, including Joan Clarke, imposters lunch, and environmental variables. I am also served as a co-leader in the Miyamoto posse.

### Self-Review

#### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment
* **3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment**
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

#### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* **3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory**
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.
* 1: Student does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

#### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.
* **3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.**
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams.

#### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.
* **3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.**

but does not do anything else of significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses just on their own learning.

#### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.
* **3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.**
