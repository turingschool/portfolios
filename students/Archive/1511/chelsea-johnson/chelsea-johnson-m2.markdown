### Blog Post

#### Posted on February 16, 2016

I've spent the last two-ish weeks learning about web tools. So far, they are pretty cool, but I also feel like the rules are more arbitrary than I'm used to (compared to learning programming languages that have mostly universal concepts). Our first tool for producing web applications was Sinatra. Today, we started exploring Rails. So far, my impression of Rails is favorable- the "rails new file_name" command that creates a million files to build your app on, the "resources :path" command that automatically creates RESTful routes with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality- seem to be nice and helpful. Oh, and I also learned about RESTful routes today- contain verb and URI's to access resources. So let's see if I maintain my favorable view of Rails ;)

### Mentor Sessions

### Community Participation

I have become more active in various Turning groups, including Joan Clarke, imposters lunch, and environmental variables. I am also helping to plan the end-of-module LAN party

### DTR Example

Setting Group Expectations

Group Member Names: Adrienne, Chelsea, Allan

When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?
 * None of us have scheduling conflicts (Allan has one meet-up per week).
We'll go home at 7 every night, if we need or want to work individually after that, we will do that. Allan has a side project he's working on after 7. We'll be here over the weekend.

How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?               
* Slack and in person.

Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

 * Adrienne: Sending emails! Chelsea might want in on this. We all don't like styling - we'll do it together. Allan will take the lead on this, and experiment with JS.

What does each group member hope to get out of the project?
 * Chelsea: become more comfortable with knowing when to drop down to model tests, writing clean views, git workflow
Allan: Learn some cool styling stuff. Adrienne: Get more comfortable with RSpec. Maybe playing with APIs.

What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?
 * Git, Waffle. We'll decide who will review on a case by case basis, as soon as they're no longer WIP.

What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?
 * Talk about it with the team - before they go to someone else.

How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?
 * In writing at the end of the project, verbally during the workflow. Mid-project verbal check-in.

### Feedback to Group Members

#### Feedback to Alex Navaratte
Alex contributed a lot to our group dynamic. He has solid communication skills and was able to convey his ideas concisely and clearly. He was open to new learning opportunities and was not daunted by implementing unfamiliar ideas. When working individually, Alex could have chosen to implement more of the ideas he shared with the group. Overall, Alex was a solid group member and I enjoyed working with him!

#### Feedback to Nick Weiland
I really enjoyed working with Nick on RushHour. He excels at problem solving and really drove our progress in the project. He has a solid understanding of ActiveRecord, demonstrates good Ruby style, and has a solid understanding of styling. Occasionally I felt Alex and I were "left in the dust" on the project because Nick had a better understanding of the concepts. However, Nick was always happy to explain his code.

#### Feedback to Allan Blair
I truly enjoyed working with Allan. His positivity and sense of humor contributed significantly to the dynamic of our group.  He demonstrates a solid understanding of Ruby and Rails and solved difficult problems with ease. He enjoys pushing the limits of his understanding and exploring new ideas (NPrrr and his side hustles). Occasionally his communication during collaborating was slightly lacking; however, his communication improved as the project progressed.

#### Feedback to Adrienne Domingus
Adrienne is a solid developer that any team would be lucky to have. She demonstrates excellent problem solving skills and is comfortable taking on new challenges. She always took time to "DTR" with me, and was happy to explain any concepts I did not understand. Adrienne was an excellent project manager; she always mindful of the group dynamic, maintained our waffle.io board,  and took steps to resolve any miscommunications. Occasionally Adrienne appeared dismissive of the other group member's ideas (even if they were terrible and deserved to be dismissed). Next time, Adrienne could explain why the idea could not be implemented. I really enjoyed working with Adrienne and look forward to our next collaboration!

### Peer Feedback

#### Alex Navaratte Notes
Working with you during our Rush Hour project was pretty dope dude! I ended up actually enjoying your company plus loved the idea that you came up with when it came to using the SSH keys! Other than that I feel like maybe the window managing stuff can be something you may improve on (even though you don’t like it) but just give it a try for like a day and see how it goes! Other than that your understanding is on point when it comes to doing any of the challenges and I would look forward to working with you again on a project soon!

#### Nick Weiland Notes
It was really great working with you and Alex on Rush Hour.  I think your future groups and future teams could really benefit from you speaking up more frequently in pairing sessions and being more assertive and vocal with project decisions.  I’d be happy to role play these situations with you if you’d like.   I was really impressed with your feature tests and your implementation of the Rush Hour sha encryption.

#### Allan Blair Notes
Chelsea is a pleasure to work with and could easily integrate into any team. She has no problem pushing through her work at an efficient pace and is by all means a competent team member. Although, what really separates Chelsea from other developers is her ability to relate with everyone on a personal level. It is simple, everyone likes Chelsea.
An area for improvement would be her creativity in problem solving. When approaching new challenges Chelsea seems to have a hard time finding her way. One way she can improve this is by forcing herself to take on new and uncomfortable challenges more regularly. This will give her the confidence that is needed to take on whatever in her way.

#### Adrienne Domingus Notes
Chelsea is an awesome teammate. Not only is she strong technically, but she has a sense of humor and attitude that makes work time enjoyable. When we hit snags, Chelsea is open to other people's ideas and provides her own, resulting in a better end result than either of us could have produced independently, and she consistently follows through with the work she commits to. One area of growth for Chelsea would be her willingness to try new things, even if she's not sure how they work - once she starts, she clearly has the ability to research and tinker until she gets things working, but has unnecessary nervousness about jumping in. Great pairing experience!

### Non-Evaluated Projects
* [Kdrama Rating App](https://github.com/cheljoh/kdrama_rating_app)
* [Skill inventory](https://github.com/cheljoh/skill-inventory-crud)
* [Tool Chest](https://github.com/cheljoh/tool_chest)
* [Mix Master](https://github.com/cheljoh/mix_master.git)

##### Pull Request Examples
 * Implemented cat reviews. Registered users can now review a cat. Unregistered users cannot review cats, but they are able to see the cat reviews from registered users. Added the necessary models, views, and migrations for cat reviews.
 * Added edit, update, and destroy for making cats. Added necessary links, routes, and views. Added link to make a new cat in the admin dashboard and a link to the cat show page from the cat index. Had an issue when deleting a cat tied to an order, so added "dependent: :destroy" in the cat model to resolve issue.

### Evaluated Projects

##### Rush Hour

Evaluator: Rachel

Notes

Empty payload creates error. Group misunderstood directions- supported missing attribute instead.

Should have checked attributes in server_test.rb. Good idea to have client registration test and payload processing tests instead of one big test for server.

Find or create by would blow up if you have validations.

All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existence. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

 * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

 * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

 * 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

 * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

 * 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

6. View Layer

 * 4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

##### Little Shop

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

Would be nice to have a "join us" button so you don't have to navigate to "create account"
Would rather see variables for collections.

UI is great. Very intuitive. Only suggestion is to add link to login or create user if in opposite page

Extensions were great. JavaScript - Calendar - Reddit API
Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:

1. Feature Completeness

 * 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

2. Views

 * 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

3. Controllers

 * 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

4. Models

 * 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

5. Testing

 * 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

6. Usability

 * 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

7. Workflow

 * 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
