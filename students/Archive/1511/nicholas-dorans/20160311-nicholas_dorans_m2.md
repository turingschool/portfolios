### Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not isolate appropriate data per test

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**July Tran:** I can not say enough kind words about July. We got to know each other better in Mod 2 and although we haven’t worked with each other directly on a project, we have collaborated on other things. Not only is she a great student (and willing to help out anybody who needs it) but she also has great initiative in driving positive change for our community. One of her passions is environmental responsibility - which is near and dear to my heart as well. When I heard that her and Beth Sebian were starting an Environmental Responsibility club I knew I wanted to be involved. I was blown away by how great of a leader she is, and staying on top of everybody to make sure that we followed through with our goals. This led to changes in the way we recycle at school and the first student-led Gear Up session at Turing. Again this was a collaboration effort between her and Beth, but they both put in a lot of hard work. I think it was a success, and hopefully there's many more to come in the future. July also has a great personality, and anytime I’m feeling down I know I can go to her to get cheered up. She is the type of person I can see driving positive change in the world, and I’m proud to call her a friend of mine.

>**Erinna Chen:** Erinna is super fast with her workflow and thought process. I'm writing this a week after the project was assessed and I've noticed that my own personal speed has increased since working with her. The only critique I can come up with is that she made a few decisions based on what other people were doing, and our implementation was probably fine enough. Having said that, Erinna came up with some amazing code towards the end that really put our project over the top. I would say that she came up with most of the best parts of our project. The other great thing about Erinna during the project is that she was always willing to slow down and explain things to me until I understood it. I learned a lot during this project and that was all due to Erinna.

>**Ling Tran:** Ling is a super smart girl and a real straight shooter. She reached out to me before school started to see if she could get any tips on how to be successful in mod 1. The main thing I noticed about her right away is her attention to detail - she took meticulous notes on everything I said. I have since paired with her a few times and I’m blown away at how fast she picks up on stuff. From looking at her code, I would say she’s a better coder than I was at that time. If I were to have one critique about Ling, it’s that she didn’t have a profile pic for Slack until last week (I basically badgered her until she made one). It may not seem like a big deal but when you interact with people on Slack it’s helpful to have a face to go along with the name. That way people can recognize you in real life. She gets it now, and will have a lustrous Slack future now. I look forward to pairing with Ling in the future because she has a different way of looking at things than me. For that reason I believe pairing with her can be beneficial for both parties. Ling will have great success with this program.

>**Chad Ellison:** Chad is a beast. I was lucky enough to work with Chad on two consecutive projects. The first one was called The Gipherator. It was a cool little project where we hit the giphy API and returned random GIFs based on search parameters. Chad was super pumped when we finally returned some actual GIFs, and so was I! Our next project was Little Shop and that was another enjoyable experience. Chad was a beast on this project. He was eating up waffle cards like it was nobody’s business!! I’m sad to hear that Chad won’t be with us next module, but The Chad will return! 1511 is gonna miss you. Good luck with the baby, man!


### Being a Community Member

“I really appreciate Nick’s community participation. I absolutely love the emojis and other fun things Nick contributes to our community, and I know that he actually takes quite a thoughtful approach to them as a means to build community while also respecting others. I also appreciate Nick’s involvement with environment_variables; his passion is evident and he consistently follows through with his commitments.     Additionally, I was pleased to see Nick be a Gear Up facilitator both times. I think he could improve as a facilitator by keeping the group more on topic, putting more effort into engaging more quiet members of the group, and refraining from dominating the conversation himself. Nick has shown excellent community engagement and I would challenge him to take on even more of a leadership role in our community.” -**July Tran**

"I thought that this was a successful collaboration. Looking back at our DTR, it seemed like most things got done. I may have mis-estimated the timing aspect of the project. You did a good job at asking questions when you were confused, and I think that definitely helped in making it feel like a collaborative effort. I would say that we would still need to work on focusing our work efforts, the pomodoro timing really helped. Also, I think that there were some gaps in the testing, in that we didn't necessarily focus on "bad paths" when we had a time crunch towards the end of the project. Overall, I thought we had a good project. I felt that I could honestly express my opinions throughout the project, and I learned a lot." -**Erinna Chen**

"Since even before module one started, Nick has made himself available as a teacher. I particularly recall experiencing an epiphany around return values during one of our pairing sessions. Comprehending that point has improved my ability to debug in subsequent projects. Nick seems to handle pressure really well - at least when he communicates it is very even keeled. As Deb has said, "Nick is effortlessly genuine." The only constructive criticism that I can provide is regarding his teaching style. He is very approachable but there were a few times where he shared solutions before providing context around their use cases. He is very intentional about not doing that, so I would say keep that up! I'm really glad I was able to befriend someone like Nick. He is definitely an integral soul to the Turing community. Thanks for being you, Nick!" -**Ling Tran**

"I had the pleasure of working with Nick on the rails mini-project and the little shop project (custo-candy-co). One of Nick's strengths as a developer that immediately stood out to me is his ability to problem solve and figure out forgien features. Nick is very methodical in his approach. This was evidenced through the way he thoroughly reviewed the pull requests and made sure we did the same. He also carefully read through the error messages when we were debugging and his insights benefitted our group significantly. Lastly, Nick is just enjoyable to work with and be around. He constantly kept the mood light and helped us enjoy our project more." -**Chad Ellison**

* Brought joy in general to people's lives.


## Review

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

### Notes: 

* Made great improvememnts throughout the module
* Learned a lot under pressure
* Prioritize working on Github with workflow
* Play Catan
* Productivity lunch was really productive
* People appreciate your light harted genuine nature

### Outcome:

Pass
