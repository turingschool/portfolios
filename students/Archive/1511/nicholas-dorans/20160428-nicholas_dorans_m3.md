### Attendance

I was not absent this module.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessor: Nate

Notes:

- Service could be organized better, but basically does what it should
- Try to avoid using services in a controller, but SearchController is small enough
- Tests are good, but last few request specs could cover more of the case, i.e. check that item was created or deleted
- Try to avoid using hashes in the view

#### Self-directed Personal Project

#### Lunch Roulette

Assessor: Nate

Notes:

- Could make your app more restful
- Need to push logic down. Controllers are way too big.
- Really cool slack slash commands. I'd already use the restaurant recommendations and food prefs ones.

### Giving Feedback

>**Allan Blair:**

>"I’m gonna first say, I really like Allan a lot. We've gotten to know each other pretty well over the last 3 modules and I had the privilege of working with him for the pivot project this module. It was a great experience - Allan is a coding machine and a great person to work with.  When Josh told our group “ya know it would be cool if you could have a drone launch upon order completion - people have tried it before but no one could do it”, the look on Allan’s face was CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. So he went ahead a wrote a whole separate program, written in Go, that wrapped around another program written in Node.JS, which communicated with a drone and launched it off. It took him a few days, a lot of trial and error (thank god the drone didn’t break on us), but he got the job done! Our app was able to launch off a drone and it was freaking sweet! If I were to have one critique about Allan, it would be that he can be a bit abrasive and harsh at times, but that’s only because he’s brutally honest. I trust and respect his opinion on many things, and I really enjoy getting feedback from him. I may not always agree with him, but he’s usually right. Allan will go on to do great things in life, he’s got the drive and intelligence to do whatever he wants to."

>**Kimiko Kano:**

>"Kimi is an amazing person. I had the privilege of working with Kimi on the pivot project this module. She didn’t start off in our group, but rather was “pivoted” into ours 4 days into the project. Which was a blessing in disguise because I had never paired with her on a project, but always wanted to. We hit a lot of problems during the project, A LOT OF PROBLEMS,  but at no point did I ever feel like she was gonna give up on me. We worked meticulously through every problem we encountered.  Maybe we had a slow start to the project but we finished very strong! I also felt like we both learned a ton during this project, which is what we both wanted. Her dedication to the program is super strong - she even started a fitness group to help out the whole community. She also implemented a strict “pull-up-doro” policy during our project. Kimi will be a fantastic developer, and an absolute asset to any team she’s on. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the world would be a better place with more Kimi’s in it!"

>**Karina Gonzalez:**

>"Karina is a really cool girl, I knew that before I even met her because she was heavily involved in the Turing Hip Hop channel on Slack. Once I did meet her, I realized she’s a very intelligent girl who’s very passionate about different things. Things like public health, the environment, global issues in general, and art - all of which are things that I am also passionate about. Although I haven’t paired with her directly on a project, I have given her some help with a project or two and I noticed that she’s very quick to pick up on new concepts. She’s a pretty good programmer and one hell of a pseudo coder! I gave her major props for being the only team that wanted to do Headcount for their final project - someone had to do it! I believe Karina will do very well in the Turing program, and go on to be a great web developer. She’s already added great value to the Turing community at large."

### Being a Community Member

>"Nicholas typically knows how to get an app done. I would say that Nick has the tools to solve just about any problem that comes his way. He can work on forming his own opinions on code design and architecture. Without a solid set of rules and structure Nick can have a hard time being decisive. With a more rigid dogma on code design he can take his skills to the next level."-**Allan Blair**

>"Nick and I paired on much of the Pivot project together and we had great collaboration on this project. He's very good at talking through and explaining his thoughts while coding and I felt very comfortable working with him. We worked many long hours and late nights on this project and although it was exhausting, Nick maintained a good attitude about everything and I felt confident that we would get through it. He's a very giving person and I have often seen him helping others at Turing. At times he can be very hard on himself and ruminate over small issues. He should work on not letting other people's opinions get to him and drag him down because he is a great guy and an awesome person to pair with!"-**Kimiko Kano**

>"Nick’s nickname “nonaps” reached me through the vine before I even met him.  I took note of the positive nature in which his nickname would come up, and became eager to meet this sleep-deprived individual. I finally got the pleasure of speaking with him when we got paired for a group retro—   I remember being taken aback by his open-mindedness, eloquent way of expressing his ideas, and his effortless ability to mediate even the most controversial conversations with his light-hearted levity.  It seems after that initial introduction Nick has only solidified that great first impression-- he’s heavily involved in most altruistic outlets in Turing and I deeply admire that. I still don’t really know why they call him no-naps. But I think it’s safe to assume that the countless amount of hours he spends spends coding, compassionately explaining difficult concepts to his peers, and being an overall kind-hearted activist, might have a lot to do with it."-**Karina Gonzalez**

>"I've had a chance to work with Nick both in Pahlka posse and in environment variables. In both settings, his commitment to the group and the work is clear. He has a real talent, which he may or may not be aware of, of using his humor to both lighten the mood around a serious issue while simultaneously uniting the group around the issue. This is a delicate skill, and he's not always successful, but it's valuable enough that I hope he continues to refine his presence in groups to capitalize on those talents even more. I've thoroughly enjoyed the time I've had to work with Nick."-**Beth Sebian**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* I anchored the Hopper Posse and met up for mod 1 academic support every morning.
* I also joined the Pahlka Posse and helped develop an app to find low income housing. You can find out about that [here](https://github.com/bethsebian/affordable-housing-app).
* I'm involved in the Productivity lunch group and it has helped me be a better person.
* I'm also involved in the Environment Variables club where we're doing important things to change the world one recycling bin at a time.
* I'm also also running the Imposters group with Ilana.
* ALSO I'm planning on starting a new posse revolving around 3D printing.
* And I'm here to help people whenever they need help. I will continue to do this.
