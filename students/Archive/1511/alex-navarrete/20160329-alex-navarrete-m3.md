## Individual

### Goals
- I would like to learn how to use API's and see what all the hype is about. They seem like they're database that I can just call specific methods to grab certain type of information from it.

- I want to learn and see what it takes for someone to really be considered a software engineer in the eyes of Turing.

### Work

The following are list of individual projects that were assigned in Mod 3:

#### Misconceptions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/misconceptions)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Misconceptions is a project where I single handedly try solving misconceptions on the top four most discriminated communities within the United States (Latino American, African American, LGBT, and American Muslims).

This idea came to live when I experienced racism for the first time here in Denver for being a Latino. Not just that but as the polls show, racism is still alive and now they're not even concealing it.

I figured besides going on my Malcolm X sh*t I decided to take the alternative and place myself in that individual's mindset on why they would think that way about someone else's culture. By placing myself in this mindset I realized that most of the time people have these thoughts due to misconceptions they perceive of other people who they have really never got a chance to truly understand.

And due to this fact, many people with a voice in this world take advantage of our ignorance. This is why I decided to push myself into making this project come to live as far as possible with the little skills I have in programming.

### Projects

The following project is an evaluated team project that was assigned in Mod 3:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/adamhundley/the_pivot()
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The goal for this project was to use someone else's code from Little Shop (Module 2's final project) and "pivot" it to a completely different website from what it originally was. It is part of Turing's curriculum to teach us the importance of working with someone else's code where we would need to either add, remove, or reuse code efficiently to make the user stories a reality.

Evaluator: Josh Mejia

#### Notes
- Really solid UI/UX. Added Google maps, a slider for selecting prices, nice use of calendars and dates. Solid code quality and good use of POROs. Resorted to Ruby when ActiveRecord could have been used but overall really good code quality.

#### Score
##### Feature Delivery

__Completion__: 4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
__Organization__: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
__Git Workflow__: 4: Team always pull requests to introduce code to their project in a professional manner. Most commits are squashed.

##### Technical Quality

__Test-Driven Development__: 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
__Code Quality__: 3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

##### Product Experience
__User Experience__: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

##### Risk Taking and Creativity
__Extensions__: 4: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Parker Phillips: Its amazing how far you've come when we talk about programming since I remember sitting down with you for a while explaining how a loop method works in Ruby. As the weeks passed by it was cool seeing how you'd come up to me and tell me about how your projects have gone and the amazing scores you'd get with the work you have put in. Another thing I really enjoyed about you is how you'd always ask me questions and would be able to understand the advice I'd give you in return. I know without a doubt that you will really be a good programmer and enjoy the challenges that Turing provides. Keep me updated when your time comes to do your personal project, I'll look forward to it. -- Alex Navarrete

Karina Gonzalez: Yo Kanye! It was really cool meeting you this module with the spare time we sometimes made to hang out
or just talk about some random ishhh. I'm really glad you made the decision to push yourself into coming into a school like Turing. I know for a fact that if you keep on pushing yourself to be the best you can be that you'd be able to accomplish great things in life that'll not only benefit you but the people you care about. What gets to me the most is how we have extremely similar backgrounds and yet somehow ended up decided to try out the tech game to see what all the hype is about. Oh y gracias por eñsenarme cómo jugar <<Battleship>>. -- Alex Navarrete

### Being a Community Member

"Alex is such a breath of fresh air when it comes to Turing. His outlook on life and desire to learn EVERYTHING is contagious. He pushed himself in the tasks he took on with The Pivot and was successful in all of his attempts. He is turning into a great developer and I can't wait to see what he does in the future." --Adam Hundley

"Alex Navarrete, you were the first person I met at Turing, and you were welcoming from the very beginning. If I had any questions about my pre work you were eager to help me out, and also explained more complex ideas. I still appreciate that so much. That persisted for the entire module. I know module 3 sounds like a beast, but the fact that you never shied away from helping me out or looking at my code was a blessing man. I really respect your work ethic, and personally don't feel like you give yourself enough credit. The knowledge that you have about coding is very impressive, everything that you've talked with me about has been clear, concise, and correct. Your willingness to tackle challenges is very admirable, I'm stoked to see where you take all of this drive, ambition, and talent, I think you'll go very far." --Parker Phillips

### Playing a Part

During intermission week I came in one morning before anyone was in the basement to find out how much of a mess it was. It pissed me off seeing how there was clothes, lunch bags, containers, dishes, etc. laying around that I took matters into my own hands and cleaned up the Big Workspace and Classroom C.

I also ended up helping out a couple of module one students by giving them advice about what to expect about the school and going over their intermission week work with them.

#### Self Evaluation

##### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

##### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

##### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

##### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

##### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback to shape their own character and behavior.

## Review

### Instructor Scores

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 2
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
* C: Group Work & Projects: 4
* D: Community Participation: 3 
* E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3

### Notes

- You want to repeat the module, because he wants to be really strong in all areas that we teach at Turing.
- You're very focused on your growth and your skills, and what you can do with them in the long run
- You're a great team member when you're on a team project. I want you to be more involved in the Turing family, but that's mostly because I want more people to be exposed to your energy and perspective.

### Outcome

RETAINED
