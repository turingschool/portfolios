### Your Mission

My mission this time around repeating Module 1 was to learn from my failures and work hard on making sure I would do better. As I have stated before, I am finally in a place where I am no longer one of the top students in my class, which I am thankful for. I will always be thankful for all the lessons I learn on a daily basis that allows me to gain experience in many categories that are not only based on software engineering.

Never have I ever worked hard in my life for something so difficult. These past couple weeks have not been fun either, but I have managed to keep my sanity by making sure the hard work I did paid off. To sum up my mission, I guess I can say that it has not changed since the first time I walked in this building during my in-person interview with Horace.

As always, my mission has and will be to become a better person to use these skills in the future to help myself and my community back home.

### Projects
Below is a collection of individual and paired projects I have done throughout Module One.
#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/a0ccb625762f2ead4d0bcf554c88daeda1784eea/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project was not easy to implement the second time around but I got a better understanding of how Linked Lists work. The most challenging part about it was being limited on knowing which types of methods to use during the process. But it also allowed me to realize some things I could not understand last time such as how the links actually connect to others.

Instructor: Steve

#### Notes

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:


* Functional Expectations 3: Application fulfills all base expectations


* Test-Driven Development 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data. Also diligently covers all appropriate cases.


*  Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


* Fundamental Ruby & Style 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


*  Looping *or* Recursion 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/Engima)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

The goal for this project was learning about how File I/O functionality worked and also how to use the skills we have built on learning how to make an Enigma machine. It was pretty cool because of the fact how we mimicked some aspects of the same encryption machine that the Nazi's used during WWII to communicate. This was the project that showed me how much I have grown with my programming techniques. Before, it seemed nearly impossible but the second time around I learned a lot about refactoring, Ruby Syntax, etc.

Instructor: Tess

#### Notes:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

* Overall Functionality: 3 Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4 Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

* Test-Driven Development: 3 Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

* Breaking Logic into Components: 4 Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project was the first project everyone in the cohort did with a pair that was the beginning of where things in Turing really got interesting. The things that made it interesting was the fact how we never took a class on servers, Postman, etc. and paired up with another student to see what we can do. It was nice figuring out how to make Postman work compared to last time around where I could not even pass the first iteration. Oh and we were the reason of why the Hurley gem is dead...

#### Notes:

Assessors: Meeka

Overall Functionality
Score: 3

Fundamental Ruby & Style Score: 3

* Keep an eye out for splitting code by [endpoint](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9807382/what-is-a-web-service-endpoint)
* Really nice usage of named method. [For example](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me/blob/master/lib/response.rb#L32)
* Follow your gut and keep reading POODR to refactor many arguments being [passed to methods](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me/blob/master/lib/server.rb#L27), as you brought up in the eval!

Test-Driven Development Score: 4

* Remember to test unhappy or edgecase paths - like `?word=''` or `?word=PIZZA` or `?word=plu`
* Very nice work on working around using Hurley.
* Server should have (unskipped) tests.


Breaking Logic into Components Score: 3

* Good job on breaking larger methods into human readable pieces [like here](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me/blob/master/lib/response.rb#L29)
* As said above, think about splitting things into responsibility, endpoints, etc. Here is an [excellent example that should be split out](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me/blob/master/lib/response.rb#L7-L11).

#### Black Thursday

### Giving Feedback

"The first time I really got to know July was during our very first assigned pairing session for an exercise we had to do in class. I believe this was the first time I paired up with anyone in 1511 and I'm glad we paired up because I learned a lot as well. One of the things I learned from July was how important communication is when pairing up with July and I thank her for her openness to different ways of approaching a problem. I believe, by having that trait along the way towards being a professional software engineer, she will get along well with others during many future pairing sessions." - Alex Navarrete

"I never really knew Brian that well until we were partnered up for our HTTP Yeah You Know me project. It was interesting because I found myself teaching Brian new ways on approaching problems when it came to our project. I also like the fact how he is always aware when it is time to stop struggling and ask for help. That is something I noticed I personally lacked myself before getting to know him better. Overall, I'm glad that he was a cool partner to be paired up with over a difficult project that was new to both of us. So for that, I thank him for making it possible for both of us to turn in a successful project even when we were struggling to get passed Iteration 0 for a couple days."- Alex Navarrete

"I remember the first time I met Sunny was when it was intermission week before 1511 started the module. I can even recall the day when I saw him watching these little Ruby Tutorials online and letting him live the moment before he realized that the lessons he was learning would be done in Turing in one day. Besides all of that, I really like how open he is to breaking the ice in conversations. He thinks of topics to discuss that even I would find a bit too much to bring up, but that's a good thing! Also, his zen like attitude is what makes him who he is which brings a style that the Turing community appreciates. For feedback, I'd recommend him to not eat those frozen burritos every day." - Alex Navarrete

### Being a Community Member

"Alex is a good partner to work with. He takes his time to read the error message and think through the issue step-by-step. This has been helpful to me during our pairing sessions because I tend to move too fast. I appreciate Alex's encouraging attitude, his openness to helping others, and his curiosity about the world and eagerness to learn new things." - July Tran

"Alex was a fun partner to work with. Being able to laugh at yourself while stressed can make or break those tough moments and I was grateful that Alex had that quality. He demonstrated solid use of pry as a debugging technique. He also has a solid grasp on his ruby fundamentals and demonstrates good testing habits."- Brian Rippeto

"Alex is the man! dawg(​*read that in Alex’s voice*​). But seriously, Alex has been a huge part of turing for me. Day 1 he was helping me out, he reached out to everybody in mod 1, but I definitely took advantage of it. He used his prior experience to help motivate and steer some people in better directions. Seeing his previous code before he repeated it’s seriously inspiring to see how hard he worked to better himself. It’s night and day. He  emobided the term hustle hard. I’m really happy that he’s here and he adds some much needed mold breaking of a ​*typical*​ Turing student." - Gurusundesh Khalsa

"I paired with Alex on our final project for Module 1.  I knew that getting a partner you have good synergy with was critical to your success on the project.  Alex was the youngest member of our class and I know there is a lot of criticism about age difference when pairing.  I really enjoyed pairing with Alex because he is a great person and always laughing at a good joke.  At first glance, his fun loving attitude may lead you to think negative about his work ethic, but I found this was not the case.  We were both challenged significantly in this project and had to show determination and put in extra time to get the project done.  Alex was very upfront about how he keeps his schedule, but was always around when he said he would be putting in extra time with me. His maturity level showed strongly one night when we both wanted to go separate directions with the project.  Many other people would have had conflicts about this, but I found Alex to be very open and mature when communicating his points or and still very open minded when listening to mine.  His testing skills and workflow around the computer are top in our class and I felt we made a great team.  His determination to succeed was contagious and I wanted to put in extra effort when I could just because I knew he would do the same.  I thought Alex was a great partner and would work with him anytime."- Matthew DesMarteau

### Playing a Part

This time around I ended up playing a bigger part on helping out my classmates whenever they felt stuck in an assignment. For example, for the very first project Foxtrot had to do, I ended up staying until midnight helping out Deb with Jungle Beats. I also would always give many of my classmates a heads up on what to expect for future assignments just to lower their anxiety of the unknown.

What I would like to improve on in the future is being able to help out others by explaining things a bit more clearer.
