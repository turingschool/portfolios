## Individual

### Goals
* I would like to improve my technical skills when it comes to thinking logically on how to solve problems through Rails. I believe if I can get a good understanding of the problem before starting, it will benefit me in completing it in an efficient manner.

* Going the extra mile in learning and understanding things that wasn't required within the curriculum. I would like to dedicate more time in reading books that go even further with whatever we are going to learn in this module. I have some tutorials that I would love to really get into whenever I have some free time.

* For my soft-skills goal, I'd like to be able to improve my way of helping others when they're stuck in a problem by explaining it in a way that they can understand. As of now, I feel like whenever I explain to someone on how they should approach a problem it seems like they never understand it from me.

### End of Module Assessment

Evaluator: Andrew Carmer

#### Notes
* First test failure was for not having a form field but developer first went to making a migration. Developer knew things they needed but didn't follow the right error.
* Had trouble getting to the .where in the controller, but did get it himself.
* Directed the developer to revisit activerecord obstacle course and work on solidifying rails skills.
* Collaborated well overall

### Attendance
My iPhone alarm wasn't set on the first day of Module 2 and thus made me come in late.

### Work

### Individual

#### Mentor Sessions
* Paired up with my mentor Rick Rein when I was having trouble on understanding Tool Chest for more than four hours.

* Paired up a couple times with Roland when I was struggling to understand the MVC concept during the Mix Master assignment.

#### Blog Posts

* [SalviGod's Blogs](http://salvi6god.github.io/)

__Number of Posts:__ 4

I started off thinking I wouldn't enjoy blogging and I ended up realizing that
I really do not enjoy it at all. But, I did get something positive out of it,
which was that I found some tech bloggers whose content I really enjoy! For example,
[Netflix's blog posts](http://techblog.netflix.com/) are really fascinating because they
make me feel as if I was a dev in their company dealing with very hard software engineering problems.

## Team

The following two projects were evaluated team projects that were assigned for Mod 2:

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/weilandia/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour is a project that uses Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord in order to become a web traffic tracking and analysis tool for registered clients. It tracks down information about a visitor and the page they're viewing while submitting data to the RushHour application. The main take away from this project was to understand how web traffic works and the benefits of using ActiveRecord at a database level.

Evaluator: Rachel Warbelow

###### Notes:
- Empty payload creates error. Group misunderstood directions- supported missing attribute instead.

- Should have checked attributes in server_test.rb. Good idea to have client registration test and payload processing tests instead of one big test for server.

- Find or create by would blow up if you have validations.

- All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existence. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

###### Score
    * __Functional Expectations:__ 3
    * __Test-Driven Development:__ 4
    * __Encapsulation/Breaking Logic Into Components:__ 4
    * __Fundamental Ruby & Style:__ 4
    * __Sinatra / Web and Business Logic:__ 4
    * __View Layer:__ 4

#### Not Napster

* [Not Napster](https://github.com/scottfirestone/not_napster/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This is a fully functional website built with Rails that sells the digital encryptions of your favorite albums! In order to buy anything within the website, a guest must login or register as a user. An admin regulates the website by having CRUD functionality when it comes to anything relating the albums being sold.

* __Views:__ 4
* __Controllers:__ 3.5
* __Models:__ 3
* __Testing:__ 3
* __Usability:__ 3.5

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* __To Chelsea Johnson:__ "Working with you during our Rush Hour project was pretty dope dude! I ended up actually enjoying your company plus loved the idea that you came up with when it came to using the SSH keys! Other than that I feel like maybe the window managing stuff can be something you may improve on (even though you don’t like it) but just give it a try for like a day and see how it goes! Other than that your understanding is on point when it comes to doing any of the challenges and I would look forward to working with you again on a project soon!"

* __To Nick Weiland:__ "Honestly, I really don’t think there is anything I can really say as feedback for you since it always seems like you’re on point with what the challenges are. Other than that I really appreciate both of the times we ended up pairing up with both Rush Hour and the Mini Rails project that has been very valuable for me. Just analyzing how to react to certain solutions that seem so complex and finding the answers to it is very facisnating. I also appreciate how you would make all those shortcuts in order to make the workflow faster when it comes to implementing projects."

* __To Julian Feliciano:__ Other than being the other Latino I can relate to in our class it has been a pleasure working with you during our Not Napster project! It is very different compared to working with others due to the fact that you allow classmates to challenge themselves in understanding the problem before getting in and just “solving” it. It’s like you’re following a damn motto similar to “No Pain No Gain” watching people like Scott suffer on a horrible Gitastrophy before solving it. It’s a bittersweet type of feeling though, it sucks when it happens but the results right after is very beneficial. It has honestly helped me gain a better understanding with Rails due to that. I also like how you bring that Chi Town style into the classroom and hope that when I visit Chicago people will be as dope as you! I guess the only critical feedback I can give you is that I really want to see more of your personal stuff with Node be applied in someway for the next module. To put it Chi-Town terms, I want you to try and drop the College Dropout of the Turing game homie.

### Being a Community Member

* __From Chelsea Johnson:__ "Alex contributed a lot to our group dynamic. He has solid communication skills and was able to convey his ideas concisely and clearly. He was open to new learning opportunities and was not daunted by implementing unfamiliar ideas. When working individually, Alex could have chosen to implement more of the ideas he shared with the group. Overall, Alex was a solid group member and I enjoyed working with him!"

* __From Nick Weiland:__ "Alex: I was really impressed with your work ethic throughout Rush Hour. I think some areas for improvement include making your workflow more seamless and becoming more confident in your ability to research, test and implement solutions to problems that come up by exploring documentation.  Also, I think you have some really great ideas and some of those ideas got steam-rolled throughout the project because of a lack of buy-in from the group and/or time constraints.  I think it would have been great if you took some of this ideas and put them into action and then demonstrated what you did as leverage for implementing into the project. Bias toward action.  Keep it up man."

* __From Julian Feliciano__: "To Rich Homie Quaan (Alex): If there is one thing that stands out to me about Alex is that he has a genuine passion for learning. No matter how difficult the subject matter he is always willing to jump in and work his way through the challenge.  He is always willing to do what is needed for the teams success. I would encourage Alex to seek help when he encounters a challenge that necessitates further explanation. Overall, it has been great working with and being a fellow classmate of Alex. Keep doing you homie!"

### Playing a Part
* Participated in 1602's Mixer during my intermission week between Module One and Module Two that really made the new students feel welcomed and more familiar with the friendly environment we all provided.

* I've volunteered in the "tutoring-corner" slack channel where I helped a student from 1602 on his Enigma project.

* There was a new student (1603: Kris Sparks) who came in last week who I spent my lunch with in order to answer many of his questions that he had about the school. I also set up Spectacle and Pry on his computer that way he can start getting into a habit of how to improve his workflow.

* On March 5, I was so annoyed of how dirty the whole Big Workspace and Classroom C was that I took matters into my own hands and just picked up all the cups and dishes and placed them in the dishwasher. I also rearranged all the chairs to be in place besides just being in the center of the whole room.

* Offered to help out the new 1603 students during intermission week that way they can get some questioned/concerns out of the way before starting the program!


#### Soft Skills / Protocol Requirements
#### DTR Memo

* 1 DTR memo from a project during the module
  - [Little Shop DTR Memo](https://gist.github.com/julsfelic/1ea51f4b9a06a4a678ae)

* 1 Blog post
  - [SalviGod's Blogs](http://salvi6god.github.io/)


* 2 examples of well-written pull requests
  - [Little Shop Pull Request #95 ](https://github.com/scottfirestone/not_napster/pull/95)

* 1 example of a well-written project readme
  - [Jiffy's ReadMe](https://github.com/weilandia/jiffy/blob/master/readme.md)

#### Extra Curricular Achievements
* Was able to learn a bit more about HTML & CSS with the online courses I bought. I also ended up implementing that knowledge into the Rails Mini Project in order to have the front-end look very good!

* Was able to improve on my communication as a programmer when it came time to doing group projects. What's helped me the most is to always keep my partner aware of what I'm doing and to not stay silent for more than fifteen seconds when typing code.

* Was able to continue my habit of constantly going to the gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays that has allowed me to release some stress whenever I felt overwhelmed about a problem I was dealing with in Rails.

## Review

### Notes

* Feels like the soft-skill gaol was accomplished and a success.

* For module 3 - wants to work on personal project - cultural diversity project. Really great idea. 
* 

### Outcome

Pass
