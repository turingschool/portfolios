### Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

  * This module I basically just wanted to try and get a firm grasp on [Javascript](https://giphy.com/gifs/FCeqsn7FF2xIQ) while not losing all of my knowledge of Rails. This was pretty darned hard, but I think I got to a place where I understand how Javascript works, and I can work in the language ["comfortably"](http://giphy.com/gifs/struggle-Eagds7g4NqZ7q).

### End of Module Assessment

I squeaked in with enough points to not have to take the [End of Module Assessment](https://giphy.com/gifs/mic-drop-amZfgEVrf84Xm).

### Work

This was an interesting module for doing any kind of work, especially solo-work. It felt a little like Mod 1 again learning a new language and new syntax, but I now have the familiarity to [problem solve and troubleshoot](http://giphy.com/gifs/matt-damon-the-martian-science-shit-xT77Ye9vgKyQ9lqTbq) questions. It felt good to make things work, even if I made them work in janky ways that I didn't know were janky until much later.

###### Description
Idea box was our first foray into the [scary world](http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-scared-4nUjFdHFdHQiY) of Javascript. The application itself is a simple way to record ideas, and then vote on those ideas to make them Great, plausible, or terrible.

###### Evaluation comments
Something seems to have happened with my [submission form](http://giphy.com/gifs/sad-baby-upset-9Y5BbDSkSTiY8) here. I don't have any comments or a score breakdown.

###### Evaluation scores

## Team

### Projects

As I said above, this module made me feel a little like being in Mod 1 again, but with group projects it felt like I *wanted* it to be in Module 1. Everyone was learning together, but we all knew how to phrase our questions, our problems, and how to [approach problems](http://giphy.com/gifs/television-workaholics-adam-devine-vcHTRiZOglHNu).

#### Game Time

* [Github URL](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1511/module_4_assignments/gametime)

###### Description
There's a full rundown of the game at our [Submission Document](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/gametime/puts-puts/submission_form.md))
Puts-Puts (like putt-putt...get it? GET IT?!) is our mini-golf game built entirely in Javascript using the Webpack HTML 5 canvas.
It's cool. You can [play it here](https://brennanholtzclaw.github.io/game_time/#).

###### Evaluation comments

***Functional Expectations***

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

##### Feedback to me
Good follow up with issues for the next step and documentation. I know you ended your description with 'I was unsuccessful' but we think you were very successful in the overall goals of these two weeks.

Elastic Search is a thorny, difficult topic that we only started implementing now. A research spike is usually used for things like that because it would be irresponsible, most likely, to only spend 2 weeks researching the entirety of it and then just merging whatever into master. This is exactly the pre-work that would be needed to make the decision in the next sprint. It's just a bummer that you won't be here for that sprint (not for you, but for me.. haha)

Beefy blog post - no need for a second one, except that I'd like to read a second one...

Good work pivoting on making a concious effort to pair and get involved towards the end. You were basically 'heads down' which is a fine thing to be, but sometimes you put yer head up and say 'sup?'

You plan for having the partial branch that is attached to a well documented issue seems good to me!

## Extra Credit

### Giving Feedback
###### Heidi
Heidi Hoopes had the misfortune to work with me on two different projects this module. Fortunately this meant we got the chance to really get to know each other's workflow and [collaborate like pros](http://giphy.com/gifs/cheezburger-pokemon-pikachu-3oEduV4SOS9mmmIOkw). Working with Heidi is a joy. She knows what's going on, where the project is headed, and always has multiple ideas for steering there safely. Heidi will also put you to shame with her work ethic. When you put in a full day and feel good about what you've done, Heidi has worked longer and gotten more done. If I had a criticism it might be around this. Some times I would want her to just take a minute away from being such a badass to relax for a bit. You can tell that Heidi always gives 100-percent, even when she has things happening in her personal life. She was always there in Game Time and Scale Up to give a code review, help solve a problem, and make sure that issues were getting closed and merged.

I will miss being able to work with Heidi, and there will be no replacing her.

###### Nate
Nate Venn and I got to work together for the first time since Mod 2. He, Heidi, and myself made up what can only be called the [chillest](http://giphy.com/gifs/worth-anyway-T08JhumnpKAI8) Game Time group that's ever been formed.

That kind of sums up Nate, too. He is the most relaxed person I know that can work at 110% for a week straight with the only outward sign being some rugged 5 o'clock shadow. He's a great font of knowledge and always seems to know the syntax that you're trying to figure out. He does an amazing job of looking at foreign code and quickly [understanding](http://giphy.com/gifs/adultswim-3oGRFl37gc1kFbWy52) not only what it does, but ways that it could be improved.
I was frequently floored during Game Time when he would take a look at our complicated `request_animation` loop and just *get* where to put new pieces without breaking anything.

If you get a chance to work with the most relaxed person in the basement, take it. It's a delight.

###### Taylor
Taylor was an amazing part of the #1510 machine, and I think he was a great addition to #1511. He always has a positive attitude and encouragement when you're not feeling lke a project is [going well](http://giphy.com/gifs/space-dandy-LVbeDr6Wx1hgk).

His obvious knowledge of Javascript was a big help to many members of #1511 as we struggled into the JS forest. His competitive nature also means that he's always trying to up his game, and by doing so he is challenging everyone to rise to his level. That attitude was not only good for the knowledge of the class, but for our morale as well.
When you throw on the fact that he was job hunting, actively interviewing, and secretly stressing about his own problems, it just shows how good of a person he is.

I think Taylor is going places soon, and I look forward to seeing what that will be.
### Being a Community Member

###### Heidi
Working with Brennan on two projects in the last 6 weeks gave me a good insight into his work ethic. While he always invests a lot of thought and solid code into his own PRs, he also jumps easily into reviewing others' code and provides good feedback. He solved major bugs we had with our JavaScript-based game and was indispensable as a teammate. I believe that any workplace would benefit not only from his code skills, but also from his easy-going support of the others around him.

###### Nate
What impressed me most about Brennan, other than being a stand up guy, is that
he was never afraid of tackling the hardest aspects of a project. For
instance during Game Time he worked on calculating the ball to putter angle. I'm pretty sure he isnt a mathematician but yet he successfuly accomplished complex calculations, like trigonometry. Then during Scale Up he tackled Elastic Search by himself, and he pretty much crushed it. I have no doubt this man is going to be a great developer and asset to any company. On top of his technical skills Brennan is easy to work with and fun to be around.

###### Taylor
It was very sad to lose Brennan in 1510, he would have greatly contributed to #Keep1510Weird. So, you can imagine how happy I was to regain his compony when I joined 1511. Brennan works extremely hard to produce quality code and always has time to lend an ear. At any point he was willing to listen or comment on a PR. I not only enjoyed learning from him but I quickly felt that I gained a friend.  During his time at Turing he was away from his wife, a crucial support system, yet still managed to start the podcast and work very hard. I admire Brennan and can't wait to see what his future holds. I hope to stay in touch!

###### Brant
Brennan was an absolute pleasure to work with during Gametime. He was open to immediate feedback throughout the two week project and gave me feedback frequently as well. What a great communicator! I honestly can’t think of anyone at Turing that I would have enjoyed working with and learning with more.

*That's not true! Brennan drove me absolutely nuts during Gametime. I made a number of suggestions during our project to change and (what I thought) improve the gameplay of our game, Grand Theft Auto VI, but Brennan insisted that every car in the game had to be a Toyota Yaris. And they all had to be purple. Why purple? I still don’t get it! Why couldn’t some of them been green or blue or even just beige? Near the end of the project, we had met all of our requirements, had the game fully tested, and I asked him if I could please include an easter egg in the game….maybe just insert a hidden special car, like a classic Mustang or even a Corvette. Brennan flipped out. He started marching up and down through the big workspace just yelling at me. I have no idea what he said, because he seemed to be speaking in tongues, but by the tone I could tell that this one small request had pushed him over some imaginary line that he had drawn in the sand. I tried to stand up for myself, asking for just one small compromise, but he refused and swore that he would rather delete the entire repo before turning in a “bastardized version” of the game that he had wanted to build. Moving on….there is also the fact that Brennan insisted on pairing during the entire project, but he would never actually speak to me. He would speak, but it was more like to himself or some other third party that wasn’t actually in the room. And what’s up with that horrible clicking noise that he always makes with his tongue? Every time he completed a function he would click with his tongue three times.*

In the end, I would like to congratulate Brennan on completing Module 4 and gradating from Turing! I wish him the best and hope that we have the opportunity to work together at some point in our future careers!
