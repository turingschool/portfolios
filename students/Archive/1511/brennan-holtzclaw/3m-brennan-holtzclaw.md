# Brennan Holtzclaw Module 3 Portfolio

# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. Then I had to repeat module one and the mission changed a bit. After grinding through the basics again, my goal at Turing is now to absorb as much as possible while figuring out which portions of the process and community appeal to me most.

In Module 3 I want to become comfortable working with third-party APIs. On top of that I want to strengthen my Rails skills throughout the module.

# Goals for Module 3

* Rails

* AJAX

* Javascript

* API

## Blog Post

http://turingschool.libsyn.com/

## Mentor Sessions

I meet with my mentor, Travis Yoder, for 60 to 90 minutes every week.

## End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

Assessed by: Josh M.

Exercise: Serve and Consume API

* Using hashes in the view instead of objects.
* Works for single search term (had a pry session in there.)
* Nice use of serializer for formatting.

#### Scores

***Ruby Style:*** **3** -  Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

***Rails Syntax and API:*** **3** -  Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

***Testing:*** **3** - Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

***Progression/Completion:*** **3** - Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

***Workflow:*** **4** - Developer commits every 15 minutes

# Final Project

#### Notes

Assessed by: Nate

Exercise: MTG Deck Builder

* Some funky code organization. Make it more MVC.
* Good work on getting the AJAX working, but there are some AJAX/jquery/JS knowlege gaps
* Good use of caching
* Service could be better organized and broken up

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.

***Organization:*** **3** - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

***Test Driven Development:*** **1** - Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage).

***Code Quality:*** **2** - Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.

***User Experience:*** **3** - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

***Performance:*** **4** - Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

# Evaluated Projects

## The Pivot

Group: Nick W., Charissa, Lenny, Brennan

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Remember to buy Nate a big hat
* Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
* Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
* Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

Repository: https://github.com/JaggedLaw/the_pivot

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** - Team completed all the user stories nd requirements set by the client.

***Organization:*** **4** - Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

***Git Workflow*** **3** - Team always used pull requests to introduce code to their project.

***TDD:*** **3** - Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

***Code Quality:*** **3** - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

***User Experience:*** **3** - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

***Risk Taking (Extensions):*** **4** - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.

## Rales Engine

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Could DRY out controllers if you like
* You've sacrificed data integrity to make your JSON match the spec harness
* Good test coverage, but could be DRYer
* Verbose routes file which is fine

Repository: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/rails_engine

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** -  Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

***TDD:*** **4** - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

***Code Quality:*** **3** - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

***API Design:*** **3** -  Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

***Queries*** **4** - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality.

# Community

### Attendance
I didn't miss any days of class this module.

### Giving feedback

* Charissa has been a great addition to 1511 and I was able to see how she touched so many in the Turing community as well. After The Pivot pivot I got plopped onto a team with her, and I was really pleased to see how well she seemed to handle the shake-up. Charissa is incredibly quiet most of the time, which had me worried about team communication at first, but I quickly learned it wouldn’t be a problem. When she had a question she’d be quick to ask, and I felt comfortable bringing code her way when I got stuck. She was a great team player, and is definitely someone I want to work with again soon. On top of all that, Charissa’s lightning talk was a touching tribute, and actually spoke to a real problem in our society. That doesn’t happen much in those silly 5 minute speeches. I think she is going to have great ideas, and do big things in module 4 and especially in the world outside the basement. - Brennan Holtzclaw

* Nick was a great group leader during the Pivot. It’s really cool to work with someone that seems to be a natural at this coding thing we’re all dealing with. He did a great job of making sure each of us in the group were challenged, while also taking the time to explain exactly what was going on to each of us. I look forward to pairing with Nick again soon. - Brennan Holtzclaw

* Working with Lenny again was a pleasant throwback to module 1. I feel like Lenny and I have very similar working/learning styles (though I may be way off, it’s impossible to really know The Lenny). He seems to be most interested in drilling down to a real understanding of the material at hand. Whenever he encounters a problem he takes the time to dig down into what the problem is, and how to logically solve it. I liked working through problems with Lenny during The Pivot. Since we managed to stay paired up even after The Pivot pivot He was the person I spent most time working with this module. It was a great experience, and I think it taught me a lot about how we both learn. I’ve really loved having Lenny at Turing. I hope that if he leaves us we, as figments of his imagination, don’t cease to exist. :lennys_imagination:

### Getting feedback

* Brennan and I got to work together at first under not the best of circumstances. It was a pivot on the pivot and he was being thrown into a new codebase in the middle of a project. I was totally impressed with how he took on the project as seamlessly as possible. As a group we came together to make the best of it and turned in a great project in the end. It was an excellent group project experience thanks to his calm demeanor and capabilities. - Charissa Lawrence

* I helped Brennan with his personal project this week, and I was impressed by how much he took on (javascript and ajax calls and such!). Brennan is also very creative. He is a pleasure to work with, I am sad I will not get to see every day after this module. - Beth Secor

* I really enjoyed working with Brennan on the Pivot. He's a far stronger contributor than he gives himself credit for being.
He seems to approach large problems with resignation to the task that might make one image a man assigned the job of moving
a mountain a handful of rocks at a time. He shrugs, rolls up his sleeves, and gets to work. The Pivot can be a slog and the
patient diligence he brought to the project was a valuable asset to progress but the sense of humor he brought to the team
made many of the would-be-slog moments quite enjoyable. He'll be a terrific asset to whatever team is lucky enough to have him. - Lenny Myerson

* I always enjoy pairing with Brennan. It feels like he is naturally very-communicative, and when working with him, I find myself trying to mimic this. I definitely think that Brennan is hard on himself; the problems he has approached me with are not straightforward, but it feels that he sometimes goes to a place of "I'm not a good enough programmer to figure this out." As long as Brennan keeps challenging himself, he'll be an asset to any team.

### Being a community member
This module I continued to publish podcasts when possible, and I got it set up on a much more reliable distribution network. I am also a member of the Ritchie Posse.

# Self Assessment

## Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.

### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

## Portfolio Review

### Instructor Scores

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 3
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 2
* C: Group Work & Projects: 3
* D: Community Participation: 4
* E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3

### Notes

- Personal project really didn't come together. It sounds like you struggled to use the resources available to you, and struggled to engage your brain. Either because you need a break or personal life is distracting you.

### Outcome

PENDING - Brennan will redo the second section of the final assessment using AJAX for all communication with the Best Buy API. Advancement is conditional it functioning, and that Brennan can explain what he's written.
