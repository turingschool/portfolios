# Brennan Holtzclaw Module 1 Portfolio

# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. Then I had to repeat module one and the mission changed a bit. After grinding through the basics again, my goal at Turing is now to absorb as much as possible while figuring out which portions of the process and community appeal to me most.


## End of Module Assessment

My first pass through the final assessment this time went much better than before. Horace gave me my assessment and said I was the most improved mod 1 repeater he had ever seen. After I paid him his $100 assessment fee (he tells me it's standard), I pasted his notes below.

#### Notes

Assessed by: Horace

Excercise: Multipliers


<h4>Scores</h4>


***Ruby Syntax & API:*** **4** - Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer

***Ruby Style:*** **3** - Developer writes code that is easy to follow

***Blocks & Enumerations:*** **4** - Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks

***Testing:*** **3** - Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

***Workflow:*** **4** - Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

***Collaboration:*** **3** - Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

# Solo Projects

This time through I took Jeff's advice to "do Foxtrot and crush it." There are only two real solo projects for Foxtrot. My scores and notes are below.

### Jungle Beats
Jungle Beats is a project centered around linked-lists. I quickly forgot about the "crush it" idea and gave myself the extra challenge of trying to do the whole thing recursively. I ran into problems early on, and instead of re-assessing and starting over, I just powered through, ending up with ugly code. Steve K. did my assessment, his gentle notes are below.

#### Notes
Assessed By: Steve

Repository: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/jungle_beats

#### Scores

***Functionality:*** **2** - Application is missing one base expectation

***Testing:*** **3** - Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

***Encapsulation*** **1** - Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

***Ruby Style:*** **2** - Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

***Looping or Recursion:*** **3** - Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Enigma
For Enigma I tried to keep "crush it" at the forefront. I broke things into small segments, let testing drive my project, and steadily moved forward. The improvement in scores show that this was a much better approach.

#### Notes
Assessed By: Tess

Repository:
https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/enigma

#### Scores
***Functional Expectations:*** **3** - Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

***Test-Driven Development:*** **3** - Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

***Breaking Logic into Components:*** **4** - Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

***Fundamental Ruby & Style:*** **4** - Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

<h2>Mid-Module Diagnostic</h2>

Right after holiday break we came back to our Mid-Module Assessment. I really like the focus of this assessment being mythical creatures. Object action and interaction is fun to me, and I think my scores show that I grasp the area well.

<h4>Notes</h4>

Assessed by: Horace

Exercise: Centaur

Comments:

* much smoother this time around

* great workflow with some nice tooling involved

* good using keyboard shortcuts

* solid grasp of object-oriented design and concepts; seems comfortable
creating classes and methods

* style is overall pretty good; keep an eye on unnecessary boolean checks and
unnecessary branches

<h4>Scores</h4>

***Ruby Syntax & API:*** **4** - Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

***Ruby Style:*** **3** - Developer refactors for clarity but has some areas for improvement

***Testing:*** **3** - Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

***Workflow:*** **4** - Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

***Collaboration:*** **3** - Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

# Group Projects

## HTTP Yeah You Know Me
In this project we did something that the internet told us not to do at every step of the way. We built a small HTTP server, and a small game, using only Ruby. This is the first paired project of the module and I was with Chelsea Johnson, it was her first paired project ever.


#### Notes
Group: Chelsea Johnson and Brennan Holtzclaw

Assessed By: Lovisa

Repository: https://github.com/cheljoh/http

* all tests are passing

* server needs to be started in order to run the tests

* very good tests, individual tests could have been structured better, use more setup methods to dry out the tests

#### Scores
***Overall Functionality:*** **3** - Application implements four iterations

***Fundamental Ruby & Style:*** **4** - Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

***Test-Driven Development:*** **3** - Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests

***Breaking Logic into Components:*** **4** - Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## Black Thursday
Our final project was a "choice" between Headcount and ~~Sales Engine~~ Black Thursday. My partner this time was Allan Blair. We chose to do Headcount and were immediately "strongly urged" to do Black Thursday.

Black Thursday is similar to a back-end program for an e-commerce platform. We deal with information helpful for both merchants and customers. As the spec and spec harness were being re-written for our module, we encountered a lot of hurdles and submitted pull requests where ever we could.

#### Notes
Group: Allan Blair and Brennan Holtzclaw

Assessed By: Mary Curtali

Repository: https://github.com/amaxwellblair/black_thursday

* small well encapsulated classes

* good test coverage, though performance and line hits could be improved either by use of fixtures or some minor refactoring

* nice use of ruby Math & Date Time utilities to not reinvent the wheel

* documentation inside of tests!!!!

* had a nice discussion about variables & garbage collection (though I understand why we were creating vars to save on line length)

* good understand of relation between objects

* extension: coupons


#### Scores
***Functional Expectations:*** **4** - Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design

***Test-Driven Development:*** **3** - Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

***Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:*** **3** - Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

***Fundamental Ruby & Style:*** **4** - Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

***Enumerable & Collections:*** **4** - Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


# Community

### Attendance
I didn't miss any days of class in Module 1, again.

### Giving feedback
Below is some feedback from my fellow students:

Feedback for  Chelsea Johnson - "Chelsea was a beast on the project that we had together, and is just a great person in general. During HTTP Yeah You Know Me we employed a good amount of pair-word and divide-and-conquer.  While we were paired she greatly improved on talking through obstacles and laying out the logic that we needed, and while we were divided, she was able to come up with inventive solutions to our problems. She was great to work with, and I can’t wait to do it again."

Feedback for Thomas Pickett - "Thom was great to work with. When we paired during class he had a different approach (and much simpler) to the problem than I did, and it meant that I was able to learn out of a lesson I’d already done before.
He’s always a positive source, and just a generally a great guy to be around."

Feedback for Allan Blair - “Working with Allan was an adventure every day. He’s an incredibly hard worker who’s always focused on the next goal and making himself and his work better. When we weren’t working on the final project he was working on some sort of a side project to sharpen his skills in Ruby, Go, or possibly origami (I don’t know - he was just ALWAYS working).
I tried to get him to slow down sometimes, focus on smaller goals, and go with the flow when we ran into problems in the spec and spec harness. He helped me take a new look at TDD, nesting enumerables, and pushing myself harder instead of just “getting through the module.”
Outside of work he’s a genuinely good guy to hang out with. I look forward to pairing with him in the future."

### Getting feedback
Below is feedback I've gotten from my fellow students:

"Brennan and I had a very successful pairing! He was knowledgeable about the project and had many great ideas about implementation. We did a combination of live pairing and divide-and-conquer, which worked for us. I also admired his workflow and overall enthusiasm." - Chelsea Johnson

"Brennan asked a lot of questions while we paired on logic gates. He forced me to question why I wanted to complete the solution a certain way. He also did an superb job of sharing responsibility for the work, and directing the flow. I enjoyed the time working together." - Thomas Pickett

"The moment Brennan and I sat down together we were acting as if we had been pairing for years. Many would say that we just mesh. I would say nay. Due to Brennan’s high EQ he immediately adjusted to my wavelength allowing me to feel comfortable and secure in our partnership. Due to his laid-back nature and calm exterior it may be a surprise to some that Brennan is an active problem solver. Methodical in his thought process Brennan prefers to break down problems by hashing them out on paper and taking a look at the results. One way he could improve the speed of his feedback loop is to solve the simple parts of the equation mentally and use this as a base for his processes. Another worthy facet of Brennan’s kit is his love of Turing and the message he sends via his podcast. In retrospect Brennan was one of my first impressions of Turing. Since I am here you can assume it was a positive one!" - Allan Blair


### Being a community member

During my second-try at the first module here at Turing I've mostly just tried to make sure I was getting what I needed out of the program, and figuring out where I can fit in.
I recently took the lead on pushing up a Turing podcast. Production halted over the holidays, but I hope to get it picked back up very soon. I also attended most of the ~~DSA~~ Clarke Coin meetings hosted by Horace after school twice a week and took part in the Improv elective on Tuesdays.

## Review

### Notes

* bring back the podcast
* keep clarke coin alive
* consistently been an active and core member of the group; really
appreciate your influence on the group dynamic for 1511
* happy to see the second attempt go so much better -- hope you
will take time to reflect on what worked better the last time
* would love to see you organizing the cohort things that people can "opt in" to

### Outcome - PASS
