### Your Mission

It's hard to describe what this experience means to me. I'm writing this now at 3am(which means I need better time management skills), while taking a small break from our headcount project. I'm in a space where all I can think about is inter Class/method/hash relationships. I can't remember a time where I have been this academically challenged. It's been a while since I've been this personally challenged. It's also been a while since I've been this happy.

I came here wanting an accelerated trip towards programming proficiency. I'm receiving that in abundance, but I'm also in one of the most incredibly inspiring environments. I'm developing a real love for this stuff and as I see my improvements I find myself thinking more and more about programming and getting even more excited. My eyes are being opened towards so many new arenas. The truth is that I don't really know what I plan on doing at the moment, I'm just trying to soak up and learn as much as I possibly can along the way. Ask me again in 6 months ;)

## Being a Community Member

"Sunny is a connector. His chill attitude and earnest enthusiasm perpetuates through all obstacles and struggles and creates an atmosphere of positivity and tenacious energy for everyone.  Pairing with Sunny has been perhaps one of the richest and most influential experiences of my time here. We faced many challenges pairing on Headcount and I am so grateful for the openness, generosity and adaptability Sunny consistently brought to the project. Sunny is dedicated and passionate about coding and gets into a zone when he is grinding through options and chasing down bugs. Sometimes it is hard to interject things when he gets into a zone, but who can fault him for loving the coding jam so much. He will be a voracious learner as a programmer and I can't wait to see the cool and unique things he will develop." **-Deborah Hamel**

"Having had the opportunity to pair with Sunny many times throughout module 1, I can safely say that I’m thoroughly impressed with his growth as a coder. Extremely resourceful, Sunny is eager to reach out to take advantage of any and every resource available to him at Turing to expand his own knowledge. Collaborating with Sunny is a wonderful experience as he is unrelentingly positive and enthusiastic, and he is undoubtedly a strong addition to the Turing community. Reaching for actionable constructive feedback, I would encourage Sunny to continue practicing Ruby enumerables going forward, advice I would have given myself in module one as well, in retrospect. I look forward to having the opportunity to observe Sunny’s continued growth going forward, as well as to having the opportunity to pair with him on increasingly difficult projects!"
**-Joseph Perry**

"Sunny has been a great friend and classmate.  His energy and positivity helps motivate others. When I had a bad day he sat with me and encouraged me to do my best, and I know he is someone I can go to for moral support. I am not alone. It seems like he has befriended almost everyone here at Turing. With his contagious smile and asset-based thinking, it is easy to see why. He has made Turing a better place both with his energy and his community efforts, like building the plant structure. It is also amazing to see how much he has grown in his coding ability. He often stays late reviewing key concepts and is a model for grit and perseverance.  He constantly reaches out to others for help and is very resourceful. I feel very lucky to call him a friend. As Sunny becomes more knowledgeable about Ruby, I would like to see him relying less on others for help and more on his own thinking. I believe he will find that he understands things significantly more than he knew by doing this."
**-Marina Corona**

"I remember the first time I met Sunny was when it was intermission week before 1511 started the module. I can even recall the day when I saw him watching these little Ruby Tutorials online and letting him live the moment before he realized that the lessons he was learning would be done in Turing in one day. Besides all of that, I really like how open he is to breaking the ice in conversations. He thinks of topics to discuss that even I would find a bit too much to bring up, but that's a good thing! Also, his zen like attitude is what makes him who he is which brings a style that the Turing community appreciates. For feedback, I'd recommend him to not eat those frozen burritos every day." **-Alex Navarrete LA Kid**

"Over Christmas break, I had the privilege to pair with Gurusundesh, his insight and perspective to coding is mind-boggling. His adaptation to many different scenarios and being able to view multiple different elements within the code was superb. Sunny is one of the most positive, good-hearted people I have ever met in my life. His approach to coding is the same in his everyday life. Taking challenges with a grain of rice and seeing all the positive outcomes of a frustrated situations. His positive demeanor and yes attitude has helped me and most  of our cohort out on frustrating days. Sunny is a team player, motivator and all around great coder who views code in multiple ways that is challenging for most people to see. I hope one day to have the adaptability my programing the same way that sunny has to his programing." **-Alireza Anderson**

"Sunny is one of the most genuine people that I have had the pleasure of meeting.  He would gladly give you the shirt off his back(or more likely share tea from his backpack- as he did for me while I was sick), because he genuinely cares.  His curiosity is contagious and makes you want to dive deep to gain full understanding of whats happening in every facet of a project.  This is an excellent attribute to have however it may slow down progress at times." **-David Whitaker**

"Good ol' Sunny could literally light up a room with his smile and happiness. He is always so willing to help out anybody that is need and also look for help himself. Genuine in his actions, it always feels as if he cares deeply about whatever you may be talking about with him. As a programmer he is in a constant state of discovery and learns extremely well. As a person there is not much more to say then that this world would be a better place with more Sunny's."
**-Julian Feliciano**

"I've enjoyed working with you throughout the module. You're really good at identifying where you need to improve which shows you care, not just enough to get the job done, but to really understand the material so you can put that knowledge to work in other areas. Keep asking questions, man." **-Alon Waisman**

### Giving Feedback

**Deborah Hamel**: "Deb is a real joy to have in class. She’s very easy going and has such a natural charm about her that can always lighten a situation. She’s extremely kind and caring and is always there for people in a very authentic way. Im currently pairing with her on the Headcount project and I consider myself very lucky, however I was a bit apprehensive when I saw that I was paired with her for this major project. Some of our weaknesses are not exactly the most complimentary. I think it was somewhere around day 3 when we were in a pretty deep hole and I was feeling a bit pessimistic about the whole thing that I was able to see her real character. I never saw her falter. I know she has a lot on her plate, but you wouldn’t know it. She has a determination and resolve that will get her through anything. I am seriously in awe. She’s great, and she is going to be an amazing programmer, I just hope she sees it as well."

**Julian Feliciano**: "I can easily say that for myself and many others in our cohort that we feel really lucky to have Julian here with us. He is obviously highly skilled, but he lives in that beautiful cross section of being really talented but also graciously humble. He is extremely approachable and I can’t remember a single time that he ever turned somebody down that was asking for help. I’m talking about all nighter level tired, but still willing to walk away from his project and help you out. He’s very passionate about programming and loves talking about all the new technologies,languages, frameworks. I always find myself learning new things when I spend time with him."

**Marina Corona**: "Marina is such an asset to our class. I feel like on more than one occasion, she has been the only person to bring up and address issues that have been on everybody’s mind. She is an excellent facilitator by simultaneously being able to command respect while also being fun and kind. She’s a great paring partner, she brings a lot of skill to the table while also being flexible about approaches. She can be a bit hard on herself, but that is only a reflection on how badly she wants to learn and improve."

**Alex Navarrete**: "Alex is the man! dawg(​*read* that in Alex’s voice). But seriously, Alex has been a huge part of turing for me. Day 1 he was helping me out, he reached out to everybody in mod 1, but I definitely took advantage of it. He used his prior experience to help motivate and steer some people in better directions. Seeing his previous code before he repeated it’s seriously inspiring to see how hard he worked to better himself. It’s night and day. He  embodied the term hustle hard. I’m really happy that he’s here and he adds some much needed mold breaking of a ​"typical​" Turing student."

**Alireza Anderson**: "I’m going to keep this short and sweet. When I was super desperate and had to find a place to live during our break, he drove me around all day calling everybody he knew, reaching out to any connections he had to find me a place. He wouldn’t take no for an answer, actually inviting me to live at his home if I couldn’t find a place. He’s a solid dude, and its been great to have him in our class."

**Joseph Perry**: "I hear JP’s name so much in my cohort that sometimes it seems like he is in my module. I’ve witnessed the countless pairing sessions and assignment sit-downs, but I’ve also been extremely lucky in getting the chance to pair with him as well. He is highly adept at taking complex problems and dishing them out in digestible bite size portions. Fundamental parts of ruby such as Classes, methods, blocks, arguments, the stack, etc were difficult for me in the beginning and I attribute a lot of the progress that I made early on to JP. He is a wonderful addition to Turing and a great part of this community."


### Playing a Part

* Planned and built the plant display in the back of the main workspace.
* Attended the kids who code showcase.
* Made stickers for the MatzLove Posse(Matsumoto and Lovelace).
* Reached out to the new 1602 students, helping with rspec problems, pragmatic studio issues, and environment setups.

### Notes

* some hiccups in the final assessment but lovisa advocates that you pass after doing
some additional supplementary work
* it's a close call on this one but we think the right answer is ultimately
to repeat
* many of the pieces are close, but there are enough gaps across the board that
we need to see this tightened up and consolidated so that we have a good
a foundation to go into later modules

### Outcome - REPEAT

* __A End-of-Module Assessment:__ 2
* __B Individual Work & Projects:__ 2
* __C Group Work & Projects:__ 2
* __D Community Participation:__ 4
* __E Peer & Instructor Feedback:__ 3
