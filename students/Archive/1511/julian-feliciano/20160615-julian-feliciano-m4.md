# Julian Feliciano - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 4 were to expand upon my knowledge of JavaScript. This encompasses
learning ES6, React and JavaScript build tools like Webpack, Gulp and Browserify. Along
with learning more about the JavaScript, I wanted to help as many of my fellow
cohort students with JavaScript fundamentals.

### End of Module Assessment

Didn't have take it :)

### Work

The following is all of my individual work for the module.

#### (IdeaBox 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julsfelic/revenge_of_idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

IdeaBox 2.0 had us creating a sudo to-do application utilizing JavaScript, jQuery
and a Rails API. All of the applications functionality was handled with client
side JavaScript and utilized AJAX to update the Rails back-end.

(evaluation comments)
There was no evaluation comments. On the ruby submission form. So, I could imagine
Meeka saying something like 'this looks good!', and 'you should probably add styling'.

#### Trello Clone - Tiskey Whango Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julsfelic/kanban-app)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

For Tiskey Whango, we were allowed to pursue a specific project that we wanted
to work on. For myself, I wanted to expand on my knowledge of React and learn
about Flux architecture. Originally, I was going to try tackling an implementation
of Google Docs, but with the job search going on during that time, I was not able
to focus on that large of an application. Instead, I decided to try implementing
a Trello clone that would allow me to work with a Flux architecture.

I did not have an evaluation :)

### Projects

The following project was the Game Time app created by myself and partner Mr.
Allan Blair.

#### Gametime

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Gametime had us building out a browser game with JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas
API. For our game, we decided to recreate the NES classic Bomber Man!

### Giving Feedback

#### Taylor:

Having to join another module during your time at Turing can be a difficult thing. Luckily, Taylor is as easy going as it gets! Here exudes the typical Midwestern demeanor that lends him to being calm, cool and collected. Here is always willing to ask for help and picks up quickly on a new topic. Though it has only been 6 weeks, I am glad that we got to have Taylor for that time. Go forth and kick some ass dude!

#### Nick Dorans:

What a journey it has been! From week 1 till now you have fought and clawed to where you are today, a professional software developer. It has been a pleasure to call you a friend! Being able to fight through adversity is a huge key to success at Turing and I feel like you fought harder then anyone to conquer anything in your way. You have grown as both a developer and as a person. Remember that you are the one that got yourself to this position. Keep on doing you dude!

#### Kimi:

Kimi! Oh how I have loved having you as a friend for the past 7 months! Though it has had its rough patches, you've come out of Turing with the skills to be a developer. It has been awesome to see you grow from being tentative with your knowledge to being able to take charge and build out an application from scratch. Aside from programming, you have been a happy, funny and calming person for me during our time at Turing. Though I know everyone likes to think I don't stress out and I am always happy that is not always the case! Luckily, you seem to always keep a smile on your face even when everything around you might be burning to the ground lol. I know we are all tired and would like to take a break from  the craziness that is Turing, but I would encourage you to tackle the job hunt with force, because I believe you are going to make a great developer and I already know you'll make a great teammate! It's been fun Kimi and I look forward to see where you end up! Until the next Game of Thrones night!

#### David:

Though I've been known as the 'happy' one of the module, nobody, myself included, have kept their spirits higher then David. Turing can be a exhausting and emotionally draining experience and without people like David it would have been that much more difficult to keep morale up during our time together. He is never afraid to ask questions and is always willing to try to tackle something he is not familiar with. If there is only regret I have is that we never got to work together! Along with him being a strong programmer, he will prove to be a great asset to a team for everything else he brings to the table. Love ya like a brother dude and continue to rock that Midwest love!

#### July:

July!!!!!!! I've loved having you for every minute of Turing. Your fire for everything you believe in encourages me everyday to continue to hold on to the things I care about the most. Never lose that about yourself! Continue to care about everything you do and the things you believe in. Programming is just one more skill in a long list of skills on your tool belt. Use all of them to do good in this world. I see you as a little sister of mine so go out there and kick some ass alright?!?! Until next time homie!

Julian loves everything! That’s the name of the emoji I made for him, and it’s true! The only two things I could find that he doesn’t like are the White Sox and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGahT9Y_zqU). I think he’s a genius or something. He slays code sooooooo well! Julian is also an amazing teacher and has a great way of conveying his thoughts to other people. He’s been helping me out since mod 1 and we have since became great friends. I wasn’t shocked to hear that companies were actively pursuing him for employment. Makes sense, Julian is basically a Ruby/Rails/LavaScript/NodeJS master! Also, Julian is one hell of a smoker! He made a makeshift smoker in my yard a few weeks ago and smoked some pork butt. It was quite delicious. Best in Denver!! Anyway, enough of me rambling on about how great Julian is, I’m sure the reader of this is already quite aware of this. I could see Julian making a major impact on the tech scene! I wish him all the luck in the world in the future!

#### July:

JERLIERRRN!!! It’s all been said before: everyone loves Julian! I particularly love Julian because he’s the nice brother I never had, but he’d totally still knock someone out for me. It’s been awesome having Julian’s voice and perspective in our space, and I have felt more at home having someone around who gets dat minority lyfe. Also he’s a bad ass programmer and I’m excited to see him go forth and dominate.

#### Kimi:

The more I spend time around Julian, the more I both adore and admire him. He's an awesome developer, super quick and thorough, and a crazy hard-worker with all the time he puts into crafting his skill. He does a great job of teaching as well. This module he's been instrumental in helping out our whole cohort with learning JavaScript. Whatever team ends up getting Julian is very lucky and I very selfishly hope he ends up at company in Denver so that I can continue to hang out with and learn from him!

#### Taylor:

Julian is a master at JavaScript. When I needed help he always took the time to work through bugs and explain why ES5 was so messed up. He continuously told me that this was fixed in ES6. Though I never got to work with Julian, I know he would have made a great teammate! His ability to work hard, communicate and to debug will serve him very well. Good luck Julian!

### Playing a Part

* Led the Resig Posse that focused on JavaScript and React
* Actively helped Mod 4 students with ramping up with JS and fixing bugs
* Actively helped Mod 3 students with implementing AJAX calls into their final projects
* Talk to prospective and incoming students about Turing and what they can expect
* Just kept doing what I always do. Make sure the team moral is up!
