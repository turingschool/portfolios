# (Julian Feliciano) - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to leverage all the tools that we had learned up to
this point to build out professional web applications. On top of that, I wanted
to build up a solid foundation on building out API's and leveraging my JavaScript
knowledge to create highly performant applications.

### End of Module Assessment

(Assessor: Nate

Notes:

- Your service is very specific to the user stories we gave you
- Your tests are good, and they pass ðŸ¤˜
- Splitting up your service a little more would have given you a 4 on style

### 1. Ruby Style

### Projects

#### (APIcurious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/julsfelic/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

APIcurious focused on consuming a public API and using that data to re-create
the application for which we are getting the data from. In my case, the DarkSky
API doesn't have a application to mimic, so I went with creating my own personal
dashboard by hand.

### Projects

#### (NREL Market Mapper)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nrel-market-mapper/nrel-market-mapper)
* [Original Assignmet](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

The goal of the self-directed project is to create a web application from a
project idea. In the case of our project, NREL came to Turing to pitch some ideas,
one of which was the Market Mapper. The Market Mapper was an application that
they had created that allowed a user to visualize solar installation data through
an interactive map and related graphs.

### Giving Feedback

#### Kimiko Kano

Working with Kimi has been the best pairing experience to date at Turing. Her mix
of determination, willingness to learn and "I'll tackle it" attitude meshed perfectly
with my personal working style. Though she may think otherwise, Kimi writes very
clean, readable and very well refactored code. When given a problem, it takes very
little for her to quickly figure out a way to tackle the said problem. One area I
would love to see Kimi work on is on her confidence with her code. It can be tough
to get over the feeling of imposter syndrome, but if there is one thing that I
can reassure her with is that you are far from an imposter. Embrace the fact that
none of us will ever know everything there is about programming and that is the
beauty behind it! It has been a pleasure Kimi and I like forward to see what
software development has in store for you!

#### July Tran

July, July, July! The first thing that springs to mind when I hear your
name is passion. Your passion is contagious. Whether it is a passion for software
development, social issues or just simple everyday topics you can't hide the fact
that you are a very passionate person and I love that about you. Though our pivot
project didn't pan out the way we envisioned it, one thing that was certain was
that we sure as hell weren't going to go down without a fight. Though I can't be
certain, this "fight" is more than just trying to get a passing score for a project.
This "fight" is for every slight, every injustice, every time someone has doubted
us and the friends and family around us, and that is what will make you a
fantastic developer. For feedback, I would remind you to stay focused when tackling
ambitious projects. Don't take on more than you can chew without first having
a solid game plan on what needs to be done. Keep on being yourself July, and soon
enough you'll impact peoples lives.

#### David Whitaker

If there was a poster child for the phrase "glass half full" David would be it. From day one to the end of this module he has kept the same even keel attitude that everyday is a great day. As a developer, he embraces all challenges thrown his way and is never afraid to ask questions when in need. His greatest strength is his ability to quickly pick up on a solution with just a little bit of context. I'm always like to leave a bit of constructive feedback, but in the case of David he had handled himself at Turing with aplomb! Keep on keeping on dude!

### Being a Community Member

#### Kimiko Kano

Julian is a joy to be around. He's always happy and always chill, which is a demeanor that can be hard to maintain for most people at Turing. I have had a great experience pairing with him on our personal project for NREL. We had great collaboration and Julian taught me a lot about Javascript and debugging and testing and much more. I have been pretty discouraged at times during this module, but have felt much more uplifted after working on this project with Julian. That's just the effect he has on people. He has a great style of work flow and project planning and we maintained a nice balance of working super hard at times but then also being able to relax at times as well. I have no doubt that Julian will do great things with his amazing programming skills.

#### July Tran

Julian is a great partner to work with due to his easygoing personality, high level of skill, and ability to explain technical things well. I really appreciate that he is always open to questions and fields them in a friendly way, where you leave getting the help you were seeking without feeling bad about yourself during the process. His work ethic and standards of quality are legit, and they inspire me to work even harder so I can get on his level. He is an excellent listener and communicates clearly and frequently. I would have liked to have been able to pair with him at some point during our project, but unfortunately the circumstances had us mainly working separately the whole time. When I find myself without constructive criticism for someone, I challenge them to take a more active involvement in the community, but Julian already leads a posse, holds student electives, and fields questions on the reg, so I guess I will just suggest that he keep his cubby cleaner.

#### David Whitaker

Julian is one of my go to guys.  He has an amazing attitude toward both life and programming.  I feel like he does things the right when approaching how he programs.  He is amazing at tdd and has inspired me to read Testing Rails in my free time to try to get near his level.  I also really appreciate that he is always willing to help folks when theyâ€™re struggling as heâ€™s done for me many times(the guys js game is ridiculous).  Heâ€™s an excellent friend and resource to have and I hope that I get the opportunity to work with him more!

### Playing a Part

* Co-ran the Resig posse where I helped set expectations, learning material and
actively helped others with JavaScript related questions.
* Made it a priority to make sure that the spirits of 1511 as a whole where up
more times than not. Getting through m3 is more than just pure coding skill. It
involves managing stress and knowing when to take a quick breather from the chaos.
* Fielded any and all questions that were brought to me in a manner that encourages
learning how to find the answer.
* Participated in the Turing hack-a-thon.
