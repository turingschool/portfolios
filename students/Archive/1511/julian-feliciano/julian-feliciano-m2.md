# End of Module Portfolio

## Evaluation notes

### Rush Hour

* Make sure that your other teammates merge in your pull requests. It is a good idea to get another set of eyes on your code before it is merged.

* Don't be afraid to be more explicit with your variable naming. Try to avoid acronyms and shorten versions of words.

* Push logic down the stack.

### Little Shop

* Remember that we have access to our `@cart` (which is in the `ApplicationController`) throughout all of our views.

* Do not pass the session down the stack. Should be in the controller.

* Watch out for bugs! A user should not be able to view another users orders.

## Blog Post

Here is my blog post on getting started with Node:
[From Ruby to Node. A Brief Introduction](http://julsfelic.github.io//2016/02/11/from-ruby-to-node.html)

## Mentor Sessions

* February 8 (w/ Simon Taranto) - Worked on a few exercisms along with talking about cultivating a web presence through blog posts, personal website and twitter.

* February 15 (w/ Simon Taranto) - Went though an intro to Express tutorial

* February 22 (w/ Simon Taranto) - Helped / worked through a tutorial on web sockets using socket.io

## Self-solicited continual and consistent peer feedback

### Feeback given

**Alex Navarrete**: If there is one thing that stands out to me about Alex is that he has a genuine passion for learning. No matter how difficult the subject matter he is always willing to jump in and work his way through the challenge.  He is always willing to do what is needed for the teams success. I would encourage Alex to seek help when he encounters a challenge that necessitates further explanation. Overall, it has been great working with and being a fellow classmate of Alex. Keep doing you homie!

**Nate Venn**: To say that Nate has a strong work ethic would be a gross understatement. His drive to consistently push himself out of his comfort zone inspires us all to continually push ourselves. Along with being an exceptional teammate, he is always willing to listen and take notes on what he needs to improve on. I would ask Nate to continue working on his workflow, which over the past couple of modules has steadily improved. In conclusion, Nate is a everything a Turing student should and can be.

**Kimi Kano**: Kimi embodies many of the attributes that make a great developer. From a collaboration perspective, she finds the perfect balance between driving and collaborating. She quickly picks up on small errors that could potentially lead to headaches and she makes a conscious effort to write clean, maintainable code. There are some occasions were Kimi might doubt her train of thought, but I would encourage her to express her thinking out loud and assert herself when she believes there might be a better way to tackle a challenge. It has been awesome the times I have been able to pair with Kimi and hope to pair more in the future!

**Admir Draganovic**: A willingness to put in the work that is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Admir. He is always in a constant state of learning and pushes himself to grok the topic at hand. As a teammate, he has a great feel on when he needs to interject and ask questions to help further understand the smaller components that make up the whole. I would ask Admir to continue to focus on typing speed and general workflow. Once you have a consistent workflow speed going it makes getting continually feedback that much quicker and leads to a more streamlined thought process. In conclusion, Admir is a great teammate and just needs to stay the course!

**Scott Firestone**: Working with Scott is always a fun, hilarious, frustrating and enlightening. He is exceptional skilled when it comes to quickly tackling a problem and figuring out the direction that he needs to go to tackle the challenge. Rarely does he run into a problem that he can’t tackle and his code tends to be clean and maintainable. I would ask him to slow down when their is a situation that needs clear focus and organization. One attribute that sticks out is his willingness to speak his mind when he thinks there might be a clearer solution. His communication is clear and makes for an easy dialog. Overall, keep pairing me with Scott and I would be a happy teammate.

### Feeback received

**Alex Navarrete**: Other than being the other Latino I can relate to in our class it has been a pleasure working with you during our Not Napster project! It is very different compared to working with others due to the fact that you allow classmates to challenge themselves in understanding the problem before getting in and just “solving” it. It’s like you’re following a damn motto similar to “No Pain No Gain” watching people like Scott suffer on a horrible Gitastrophy before solving it. It’s a bittersweet type of feeling though, it sucks when it happens but the results right after is very beneficial. It has honestly helped me gain a better understanding with Rails due to that. I also like how you bring that Chi Town style into the classroom and hope that when I visit Chicago people will be as dope as you! I guess the only critical feedback I can give you is that I really want to see more of your personal stuff with Node be applied in someway for the next module. To put it Chi-Town terms, I want you to try and drop the College Dropout of the Turing game homie.

**Nate Venn**: I had the pleasure of working with Julian on Rush Hour. Other than being a talented programmer and developer he is also an natural project manager.  He took the role of managing our project with comfort and ease. He demonstrated organization, vision, flexibility, and had a great attitude. What I was most impressed with was how he actively supported both Scott and I in achieving our personal goals for the project.

**Scott Firestone**: In Module 2, I was lucky enough to work with Julian on Rush Hour and Little Shop. Julian came into Mod 2 with a great deal of knowledge on Rails and other languages/frameworks we had yet to tackle at Turing. My experiences reinforced my belief that he is an ideal teammate. He is insanely skilled at thinking about problems, writing tests, managing workflow, implementing code, debugging, etc, etc, etc. He also brings the perfect attitude/personality to a project. On Rush Hour, he was gracious enough to take a back seat and allow his teammates to drive mostly all of the coding. On both projects, he demonstrated his “can-do”, optimistic attitude as we worked through bugs and various git mishaps. I hope my string of luck continues and I get to work with Julian more in the future.

**Kimiko Kano**

Julian is the superstar of our cohort. Not only is he an extremely competent developer, but he is also a great person to pair with. He has a high level of attention to detail and when working with him on the Rails mini project he was very informative on giving input on how he thought our code should be structured. He has a lot more experience with Rails than anyone else in our cohort, so he's a great resource and excels at helping others without being overbearing. I think that Julian already has enough technical knowledge to be a great junior developer and that Turing will give him the confidence and experience in working with and teaching others that will make him extraordinary.

### Traffic Spy

* [Github repo](https://github.com/julsfelic/rush-hour-skeleton)

## Team: Julian Feliciano & Scott Firestone & Nate Venn
### Assessed By: Andrew
### Notes:

* Solid testing at unit, controller, and features levels. Small suggestions for model testing and feature testing.
* Solid functionality overall. Everything was there, no extentions.
* Would suggest to pay close attention to variable names. Be more explicit.
* small bits of logic sneaking into the views. No large calculations but something to be conscious of moving forward. Do not do this.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests.

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Little Shop

* [Github repo](https://github.com/scottfirestone/not_napster)

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented (user order security concern)

### 2. Views

* 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

### 3. Controllers

* 3.5

### 4. Models

* 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3.5

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## Assessments: mid-module, final

### Mid-module

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluator: Andrew

Student: Julian Feliciano

* Great diagnostic.
* Not many suggestions

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support

4. Rails Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs

5. Testing

* 4: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Final Assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

* Psuedocoded the test first - which I like.
* Wrote test for first piece, then test for second piece of functionality from the assessment challenge. Both things could have been included in the one test because it was for the same view/feature.
* Suggested he work on testing. I would have like the testing to be more natural at this point given his skill level. But overall a good solid pass.

## Feedback from group members for 1 project or 1 pairing session during the module

**Nate Venn**: Overall, the way you go about being a PM within team is great and I love that you allow me to struggle and work through a problem instead of jumping right in and solving the problem without much explanation. I would love to struggle even more when I run into those problems but due to the time constraints I understand when you are needed to jump in and speed the project along.

**Scott Firestone**: Agree with Nate on many of the same things he said. You help keep the group organized and sticking with TDD throughout the whole project. The only I would like to see, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the situation, is to be a little less pragmatic when there is a time crunch and be a little more open to exploring options when we aren't quite sure what the solution is. That is all I have Keep it up.

## Effective Pull Request Example

* [Github](https://github.com/scottfirestone/not_napster/pull/70)

## Effective ReadMe's

* [Github](https://github.com/julsfelic/rush-hour-skeleton)

# Playing a part

* Actively paired with 1602 students
* Led a student led sessions along with organizing a weekly Node / JS meetup
* Got involved with the Denver meetup community
* Focused on being a team leader and helping my teammates with their technical challenges

## Goals

1. Digging into the guts of Sinatra & Rails. I have a decent background on both and would like to know more about how they work and the latest updates to Rails (Rails 5).

2. Begin to add some creativity to the projects, adding functionality that is not necessarily apart of the project spec. Get out of the comfort zone of the specs.

3. Work on being more communicative about specific pair programming techniques that I like or don't like. Ask more questions while pair programming ("Am I explaining a specific topic fully? Am I dominating the conversation and giving you a chance to speak? What can I do to be a better pairing partner?")
4.

* Great teammate - people really like workign with you - keep it up
* Good blog post and student lead session
* Conscious of the social - soft-skill important things. 
* Wants to do visualization - find a mentor to work on a personal project with
* Great to see you pairing with Mod1
* challenge yourself in mod2
