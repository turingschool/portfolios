###Your Mission

Coming from a teaching background, I have always been interested in helping empower and educate others. I think software development helps create tools that can increase information and lead to more equality. I would like to see my knowledge and skills used to better our community in this way.  

Coming to Turing with limited programming experience, I relied heavily on strong study habits and organization to tackle our assignments. It is mind boggling to think of the amount of understanding I have gained in these last six weeks. I am excited to continue growing as a student-developer and pushing myself cognitively at school. My goal for next module is to not allow negative thinking or insecurity to cloud my own work flow and to take each assignment and break it down into small manageable steps and reward myself for accomplishing those steps.


##End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Rachel

###Scores

- Ruby Syntax & API: 3
- Ruby Style: 3
- Testing: 3
- Workflow: 3
- Collaboration: 4


##Mid-Module Diagnostic

Assessed by: Josh Cheek

###Notes

- Good job thinking through the logic
- Nice telling the person that they're stoned as opposed to having Medusa know how to do it,
  which would give her knowledge about the internals of the Person
-  Use `stone` or `stone!` over `is_stoned` Use `alive?` over `is_alive?`
and reacting to the feedback that they give
-  Not using mrspec :| <-- filled with okayness!
- Nice asserting the expected state (the person is stoned) before the expectation (that they become unstoned), but I'd assert it immediately before
applications or screen switching
- Was fun seeing you understand why they use the first in medusa.statues.first.name

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 1.


####Headcount:

[Github URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/headcount

**Real-world data collection and analysis** Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

Assessed By: Josh Cheek

#####Notes:


####HTTP

[Github URL] https://github.com/marinacor1/HTTP

**Web server** capable of requesting and responding, parsing paths, and preforming word search operations with parameters, limited functionality with game. Also, the first project to incorporate pairing and partner design.

Assessed By: Horace

#####Scores:

- Overall Functionality: 2
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
- Test-Driven Development: 2
- Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#####Notes:

 * Top-level server request/response loop algorithm is cleanly written
and easy to follow; however it is currently just spread across a lengthy
top-level loop in the project's main namespace

* Project generally suffers from long and complicated methods. most of
the concepts are there but the code needs to be cleaned up and
extracted into at least more methods and probably more objects as well

* Additionally the implementation relies on a lot of "magic numbers" - especially
hardcoding specific array indices for certain data etc.; would like to see more
of this extracted into variables and methods so that we can give them names
that describe why they're so important to the algorithm



####Enigma

[Github URL]https://github.com/marinacor1/Enigma

**Encryption/decryption machine.** Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.


Assessed By: Andrew

#####Scores:

- Overall Functionality: 1
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
- TDD: 2
- Breaking Logic Into Components: 2

#####Notes:

Encrypt works and makes a new file, however it changes from a string to an array of strings for the new file. Decrypt doesn't run from the terminal and no crack. Runner file was a god like object and had too much responsibility. Testing wasn't very TDD but on the way. Saw some highlights in some pieces of code that I thought were really good, but overall the project was unsuccessful. Instructed student to work on TDD and refactoring to smaller pieces over break


####Jungle Beats

https://github.com/marinacor1/junglebeats


**Linked list** of Jungle Beats Project emphasized understanding of linked lists through iteration and/or recursion. Program played beats on the command line and included features like append, prepend, insert, pop and find.

Assessed By: Steve

#####Scores:

- Overall Functionality: 3.5: Application fulfills all base expectations
- Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
- Test Driven Development: 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
- Breaking Logic into Components: 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
- Looping and Recursion: 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#####Notes:

- none


##Giving Feedback

Julian Feliciano - While it is clear that Julian has a strong grasp on concepts, and has had experience with the content, his knowledge helps contribute to the overall classroom learning environment. From running a session on Travis CI to regularly pairing with struggling students, he takes time to help others. His feedback is meaningful, useful and encouraging. For HeadCount, I was lucky enough to pair with him during a refactor session and he explained things so clearly that I was able to break it down and refactor a good deal of the code. His positivity is contagious and he is well loved. His commitment to his studies encourages us all. Despite completing projects early, he often stays very late to check over his code and ensure he gets the best possible grade. He even built a fort in his house so that he could stay warm and code. That determination has helped built a cohort culture of grit and determination. I hope everyone gets a chance to work with Julian at some point.

Gurusundesh Khalsa - Sunny has been a great friend and classmate.  His energy and positivity helps motivate others. When I had a bad day he sat with me and encouraged me to do my best, and I know he is someone I can go to for moral support. I am not alone. It seems like he has befriended almost everyone here at Turing. With his contagious smile and asset-based thinking, it is easy to see why. He has made Turing a better place both with his energy and his community efforts, like building the plant structure. It is also amazing to see how much he has grown in his coding ability. He often stays late reviewing key concepts and is a model for grit and perseverance.  He constantly reaches out to others for help and is very resourceful. I feel very lucky to call him a friend. As Sunny becomes more knowledgeable about Ruby, I would like to see him relying less on others for help and more on his own thinking. I believe he will find that he understands things significantly more than he knew by doing this.

Matt DesMarteau - I really enjoyed partnering with Matt for the HTTP project.  Because of our equal skill ability, we both got to share a good deal of the work.  Matt's positivity and communication really helped lift my spirits during our late night work sessions. He is also always willing to take on extra responsibilities, like stay up late to figure out the server.  In class, he's friendly, energetic and asks great questions. He is regularly checking in with classmates on how they feel they are doing and encouraging others to do their best. One thing for him to consider is he tends to look around the room at what his peers are doing and when he notices differences he distrusts his own thinking. Matt would do well to trust in his own logic and see how his programing works out.

Heidi Hoopes - I feel so lucky to have paired with Heidi for the last project of the module. Heidi is communicative, kind and organized. Though she is significantly more knowledgeable in programming than me, I felt like I can always contribute to the project. I have a much better understanding of class relationships, hashes and testing because of her thorough explanations and her patience. Besides being a great partner, she has contributed greatly to our cohort culture. She is regularly on Slack, helping other students' and sharing important Turing news. As a member of the Student Advisory Board, she ensures she is getting clear information from students and communicates that back to our cohort. In class, she asks great questions and contributes to our collective knowledge. Heidi exudes strong teamwork.  




##Getting Feedback
Marina is such an asset to our class. I feel like on more than one occasion, she has been the only person to bring up and address issues that have been on everybody’s mind. She is an excellent facilitator by simultaneously being able to command respect while also being fun and kind. She’s a great paring partner, she brings a lot of skill to the table while also being flexible about approaches. She can be a bit hard on herself, but that is only a reflection on how badly she wants to learn and improve.
-Sunny

Marina is a hardworking coding partner who uses multiple ways to attack problems, including pseudocode and pry to evaluate her expectations. Often when I would get frustrated she would still be calm and rational and her communication became valuable in finding solutions. Earlier in the module I observed that she seeks out mentors, advice, and extra assignments on her own time in order to aggressively advance her education. I have enjoyed her partnership on HeadCount.
-Heidi

In defense of Marina Corona:

Marina has been a standout student in my cohort primarily because the charge she takes in her own learning and her aptitude in communication.  She has demonstrated thorough competency with ruby, great progress as a developer in her first module, and above all else incredible tenacity in bettering herself.  She's one of the few students I've worked with who has consistently looked ahead to try and work on upcoming techniques and concepts, e.g., hash manipulation for the most recent Headcount project, and http requests for Yeah You Know Me.  She also stands out in her willingness to revisit past projects and work through things that she didn't completely grok, systematically dismantling any and all misunderstanding.  She specifically did this with the Enigma project and I feel is personally responsible for me actually being able to finally understand the project itself.  What I perhaps enjoy most about working with her is that she not only consistently provides me with a detailed context of any problem or issue she confronts, but she also succinctly describes to me what she's already tried (if she straight up doesn't just link me the code).  It's a small gesture, but as a remote mentor it's huge, especially coming from someone in their first module.  Additionally, and more so than anyone else I've worked with, she's unafraid of experimenting with her code and failing; she trusts and knows herself well enough to work through a solution to any issue she comes across given enough time. These are reflexes that interns, junior developers, and even some mid-level developers I've worked with either have never mastered or are still working to understand. This skill set is invaluable not only to her continued growth in Turing and tremendous assets to any team in which she works, but also speak volumes to her maturity as a future software developer.  Finally, a trait of hers of which I was initially wary but now believe will continue to prove to be a great advantage for her is her reflex to regularly outline and plan her work. I was afraid that this instinct might constrain her learning too much as a dev in training, but after watching her use it to increment tasks, goals, and her own learning, I think it has and will continue to help her make progress on just about everything.  In sum, I think Marina is a great fit for Turing, and I strongly recommend her continued enrollment in Turing, and I'm excited to see how she continues to develop in the modules to come.
-Jan

Being fortunate enough to have had Marina join us in Goldberg Posse, I can safely say that she has been an unflinchingly positive influence. Eager to learn and pleasant to collaborate with, I look forward to seeing Marina progress through the upcoming modules. When I've had the opportunity to pair with her, Marina has shown herself to be a great communicator who actively engages and seeks out knowledge and alternative approaches to any given problem. Pressed for actionable constructive feedback, I can only say that I would love to see Marina grow more assertively confident in her code, a topic I struggle with as well. I look forward to working with Marina more in the future, and I have no doubt she will continue to be a positive force in the Turing community!
-JP


##Playing a Part

I very much enjoy being a part of the Turing community. Here are a few ways that I have played my part:

* I organized a project introduction for HTTP: Yeah You Know Me led by Joseph Perry for any Module 1 students interested in learning more
* I organized a happy hour at Hapa Sushi the second Friday of Module 1 for Cohort 1511
* I pair at least once a week with my mentor Jan Koszewski.
* Joseph Perry and I led efforts to get Goldberg Posse to meet for warmups the first two weeks of Module 1
* I try to send a shout out at least once a week through the shout out channel
* I led a Group Retro session
* I attended the last two Tuesday coffee meetings for the Joan Clark Society
* I attended one voluntary session of improv
