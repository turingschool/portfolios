### Ritchie Posse

I enjoyed my new posse this module. We had a pretty good core group of people that showed up regularly to posse meetings and we had two posse projects that we worked on for the hackathon. The most valuable thing I took away from the posse was what we learned during the hackathon, which was in working on a SlackBot and in working with Mod 1 and Mod 2 students to build a word game.

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

For Allan Blain - I worked with Allan for a week on the Pivot project. Early on, he acknowledged that the project was not in a great place when I joined the team and I appreciated that he told me so up front so that I could prepare myself for a long week ahead. Allan did a good job of keeping our team on track to finish the project since we had to get a lot done in a short amount of time and he was quick at helping me debug whenever I got stuck on something. When Allan is in a positive mindset he brings a lot of optimism and joy to others, so I would encourage him to try to maintain that optimism more often. I'm glad to have had the opportunity to work with Allan more closely this module. I'm constantly impressed by his intelligence, how quickly he's able to grasp new concepts, and how much he pushes himself above and beyond.

For Nick Dorans - Nick and I paired on much of the Pivot project together and we had great collaboration on this project. He's very good at talking through and explaining his thoughts while coding and I felt very comfortable working with him. We worked many long hours and late nights on this project and although it was exhausting, Nick maintained a good attitude about everything and I felt confident that we would get through it. He's a very giving person and I have often seen him helping others at Turing. At times he can be very hard on himself and ruminate over small issues. He should work on not letting other people's opinions get to him and drag him down because he is a great guy and an awesome person to pair with!

For Julian Feliciano - Julian is a joy to be around. He's always happy and always chill, which is a demeanor that can be hard to maintain for most people at Turing. I have had a great experience pairing with him on our personal project for NREL. We had great collaboration and Julian taught me a lot about Javascript and debugging and testing and much more. I have been pretty discouraged at times during this module, but have felt much more uplifted after working on this project with Julian. That's just the effect he has on people. He has a great style of work flow and project planning and we maintained a nice balance of working super hard at times but then also being able to relax at times as well. I have no doubt that Julian will do great things with his amazing programming skills.

For Scott Firestone - Scott decided to take on the role of being a posse leader this module and he's done a wonderful job. He encouraged everyone in our posse to get involved in the hackathon, where we did not just one, but two posse projects. He's also been very generous with his time in helping out Mod 1 students with questions even when he had a lot of work to do on his own projects. I've leaned on him a lot this module for moral support and he's always there for me to lend an ear or help out with any questions that I may have. If there's a negative thing to say about Scott it's that he often tries to convince people to do "fun" things instead of studying and working on projects all the time. He's one of the few people that actually tries to plan social events in the midst of all of this, which does a lot to help boost morale and give us something to look forward to!

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

From Nick Dorans - Kimi is an amazing person. I had the privilege of working with Kimi on the pivot project this module. She didn’t start off in our group, but rather was “pivoted” into ours 4 days into the project. Which was a blessing in disguise because I had never paired with her on a project, but always wanted to. We hit a lot of problems during the project, A LOT OF PROBLEMS,  but at no point did I ever feel like she was gonna give up on me. We worked meticulously through every problem we encountered.  Maybe we had a slow start to the project but we finished very strong! I also felt like we both learned a ton during this project, which is what we both wanted. Her dedication to the program is super strong - she even started a fitness group to help out the whole community. She also implemented a strict “pull-up-doro” policy during our project. Kimi will be a fantastic developer, and an absolute asset to any team she’s on. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the world would be a better place with more Kimi’s in it!

From Scott Firestone - As members of the Ritchie Posse, Kimi and I worked on the food-it / food-me slackbot project during the Turing Hackathon. Kimi was deeply engaged in the project, offering ideas and solutions to move it forward. She brings a positive, “fun-to-be-around” attitude that really energizes her team. She does struggle with self-confidence at times, and she’s aware of it. Considering her work-ethic, attitude, and intelligence, I have supreme confidence in her ability to be a great developer for most any company. I would love to have her as a teammate in a professional setting.

From Allan Blair - I trust Kimiko's code. If Kimi feels comfortable I feel comfortable. Kimiko can work on prioritization. Choosing between perfect code and getting full functionality is a constant balancing act. Currently she leans towards perfection. Stay balanced.

From Julian Feliciano - Working with Kimi has been the best pairing experience to date at Turing. Her mix of determination, willingness to learn and "I'll tackle it" attitude meshed perfectly with my personal working style. Though she may think otherwise, Kimi writes very clean, readable and very well refactored code. When given a problem, it takes very little for her to quickly figure out a way to tackle the said problem. One area I would love to see Kimi work on is on her confidence with her code. It can be tough to get over the feeling of imposter syndrome, but if there is one thing that I can reassure her with is that you are far from an imposter. Embrace the fact that none of us will ever know everything there is about programming and that is the beauty behind it! It has been a pleasure Kimi and I look forward to seeing what software development has in store for you!
