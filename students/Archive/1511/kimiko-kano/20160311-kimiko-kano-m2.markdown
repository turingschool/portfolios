### Your Mission

My mission in coming to Turing is to start a new career in computer programming, with the goal of surrounding myself with other motivated and intelligent people that will constantly push me to keep learning and improving myself.

#### Goals for Module 2

1. Technical goal: Perform well in all projects (3's and 4's)

2. Technical goal: Participate in a hackathon

3. Soft skill goal: Be more assertive when working with others

### Mid-Module Evaluation

##### Evaluation:

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

  * 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API

  * 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style

##### Comments:

* Styling is good. Ui works and flows.
* Be careful of little things like variable names being explicit.
* Good scoping in feature tests. Need to focus on dynamic data not static info.
* Some view handling in the parser helper

##### Evaluation:
1. Functional Expectations

    * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

    * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

    * 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

6. View Layer

    * 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

7. Workflow (NOT GRADED)

    * 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

##### Evaluation:

1. Feature Completeness

  * 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

2. Views

  * 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

3. Controllers

  * 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

4. Models

  * 3.5

5. Testing

  * 3.5

6. Usability

  * 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

7. Workflow

  * 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

For Brian Rippeto - I worked with Brian on the week-long Rush Hour project. Brian has a very positive and easy-going demeanor, so he was great to work with. I also enjoyed our pullup and pushup pomodoros. One piece of feedback that I gave him while we were working together was that when refactoring he should be a little more careful in making changes one step at a time and running tests in between each change instead of trying to do it all at once. Hopefully this will prevent time in debugging after the fact. Overall, I think our project pairing went well and I think we all learned a lot from each other!

For Brennan Holzclaw - I worked with Brennan on the week-long Rush Hour project. Unfortunately, Brennan was very sick for the first few days of the project, but he still made an effort to come to class to work with us (once he confirmed that he was not contagious, which was appreciated). Brennan is skilled at communicating and talking through problems and he's always very calm, which is great for someone like me who can tend to get a bit stressed when I'm not understanding things right away. He also tried to get us to take more breaks from the code, which I also tend to have a hard time with. Overall, no complaints other than wishing he hadn't been so sick early on!

For Julian Feliciano - Julian is the superstar of our cohort. Not only is he an extremely competent developer, but he is also a great person to pair with. He has a high level of attention to detail and when working with him on the Rails mini project he was very informative on giving input on how he thought our code should be structured. He has a lot more experience with Rails than anyone else in our cohort, so he's a great resource and excels at helping others without being overbearing. I think that Julian already has enough technical knowledge to be a great junior developer and that Turing will give him the confidence and experience in working with and teaching others that will make him extraordinary.

For Allan Blair - One of the things that I most admire about Allan is his ability to be so forthcoming about his feelings and opinions. He tends to have a more negative view of the world than I do, and at times I think he could lighten up and not take everything so seriously, but I think he's just more critical in coming up with ideas for how things could be improved than I am. I get a lot of benefit from discussions with Allan as he often opens my eyes to new ideas and he's great at giving constructive feedback for ways that I can continue to improve my coding abilities and just myself in general. Another thing that impresses me about Allan is that he has gone all in on learning Go in addition to everything we're learning about Ruby and Rails and I can't quite comprehend how he's able to do so much. There have also been many times when he's helped me to understand a difficult concept and he's done so without making me feel like an idiot for not getting it right away.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

From Brennan Holzclaw - Kimi is a great partner, and made a great, though possibly unwilling, project lead. Kimi has a great work ethic, and knows what she's doing. I think she struggles with confidence when it comes to implementation. I think she could greatly improve her speed by just writing and debugging code rather than thinking about everything quite so long. That being said, I did find myself writing fewer bugs when paired with her, because we looked at it a little longer. I also think Kimi needs to feel more confident about just saying what she thinks - she's usually right! I'm glad to have worked with her, and look forward to doing so again

From Brian Rippeto - After successfully completing a week long project with Kimi I can say that she is a very competent programmer. Her ability to quickly google implementable solutions was impressive. She was the team lead on the project and she did a great job making sure we all figured out how to use waffle.io in a useful manner. She brings a great sense of humor to the table and my only suggestion would be to maintain that awesome sense of humor when the stress of a difficult problem becomes overwhelming. She will make a great asset to any team.

From Allan Blair - Kimi is one of my favorite people in the 1511 cohort. While my opinion doesn't mean much I think that my sentiments are echoed across the cohort. From a technical perspective both Kimi and I have backgrounds in engineering which has led to similar processes when approaching a problem. While this style of thinking is suited for algorithmic thinking, which I believe Kimi excels at, it is not well suited for innovative thinking. Kimi's methodical approach requires her to understand each component in isolation; this can become onerous when working with new technologies. One way she could improve is through diving into new or difficult projects with little heed for how they work. Getting Kimi out of her comfort zone could really take her to the next level.

From Julian Feliciano - Kimi embodies many of the attributes that make a great developer. From a collaboration perspective, she finds the perfect balance between driving and collaborating. She quickly picks up on small errors that could potentially lead to headaches and she makes a conscious effort to write clean, maintainable code. There are some occasions where Kimi might doubt her train of thought, but I would encourage her to express her thinking out loud and assert herself when she believes there might be a better way to tackle a challenge. It has been awesome the times I have been able to pair with Kimi and hope to pair more in the future!

* I attended a NAAAP event with fellow Asian Turing classmates and alums
* I participated in a Women Who Code hackathon and spoke to some women there who may be interested in attending Turing
* I attended Code Across
* I regularly climb with a group of Turing students and encourage more to join to improve wellness and participate in a Turing fitness group with Brian Rippeto.
