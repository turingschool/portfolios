# Erinna Chen - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
__By the end of Turing, I would like to:__
* be a rockstar! But barring that...
* have career options that incorporate my love of programming and my background in mathematics and large-scale computing
* be comfortable with using the tools and languages that enable the development of websites and applications
* be a active member of the Turing community and the development community at large
* have a portfolio that incorporates academic work and a significant number of personally-driven projects
* have strong personal relationships with students and staff of Turing and with mentors outside of Turing

Perhaps my goals were rather vague, and I didn't actually review them when I should have. I think I did accomplish the things that I wanted. Maybe fame and fortune will come in the near future.

Because yes.

### Final Score
Yay Points! 1066 out of 1138

### Attendance
I was present all days this module, with some random meetings and such which I stepped out for.

### Projects

#### IdeaBox 2.0
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/genius-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)
* [Submission Form](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0/erinna_chen.markdown)
* [Genius box in action](http://damp-island-60810.herokuapp.com/)

A single page application built with vanilla JS/jQuery on the front-end and Rails on the back end. Keep those sweet genius ideas in a box.

__Evaluation by Meeka:__
- Nice work
- Good use of delegation.
- Spacing is off in a few places
- An easier way to do document.ready would be to have larger functions that do set up for you and calling them all in the document.ready block - You don't need to wrap all of your JS code in it.
- Don't skip the READMEs!

Score: __143/150__

__Personal Notes:__
- This could have been more modularized
- I think consistency between using built-in JavaScript and jQuery could be better.
- I like Rails on the backend.
- JavaScript is sorta fun, but I'm not into the hype.

#### Bubble Bobble
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/bubble_bobble/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Production Site](http://bubble-bobble-redux.herokuapp.com/)

Bob is a dragon who likes to blow bubbles. He has a friend Bub who is always the bridesmaid, but he too likes to blow bubbles. We built a battle zone so that they could duke it out in a friendly but competitive manner.

Combined score: **310/300**

__Personal Notes:__
- I ðŸ’–Adrienne. Its nice to have gotten to work with someone that I didn't have to figure out how to communicate with.
- There were JavaScript struggles, and I return to this project a lot to think about SRP and such.
- Dinosaurs. 'nuff said.

#### Scaleup: BoxTango
__Overview:__
* [Looking For Week 4](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)
* [Looking For repo](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)
* [Whiskey Tango Week 5](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)
* [Clarke Coin Socket repo](https://github.com/erinnachen/clarke_coin_socket)
* [The nitty gritty details](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/scale-up-wk-5/erinna-chen-boxtrot-tango.markdown)

I was involved in two projects over the course of two weeks. One week was spent on the LookingFor Rails application team, and the other was a self-directed Phoenix application for interacting with Clarke Coin nodes.

__Evaluation by Louisa:__

I'm glad you pivoted to the independent project for week 2, it seemed like a better fit interest-wise as well as where you were mentally. It's tough getting put on a big group project, and we're so glad you were able to move to a project/topic that would let feel good about your final weeks at Turing!

Combined score: **300/300**

__Personal Notes:__
- LookingFor was a challenging group project for me. I need to work on being kinder.
- I think two weeks is a good amount of time to get something large off the ground.
- I think I struggle right now with knowing at what point to ask for help/ how to get regular mentorship.

### Feedback to Me

*  __Adrienne Domingus (1511):__ (GameTime Partner)

Working with Erinna was a highlight of Turing pairing experiences. Not only is she a talented developer, but she shows an impressive commitment to clean code, refactoring, and testing at all phases of her work. Doing this early and often was invaluable to our ability to be successful at later stages of the project. She also shows a willingness to help others, and is fun to be around to boot!

*  __Meeka Gayhart (Instructor Extraordinaire):__

You are an incredibly strong developer. Like, ridiculously strong. On top of being very smart, competent, and a hard worker you also bring a ton of enthusiasm to things that you do. Itâ€™s been really fun having you in classes, because you contribute a lot and have good, well thought out and generally constructive feedback. I predict that you will be in working situations where you are the best developer in the room, and if you are arenâ€™t, you will work with the best developer in the room and be the person they think of when they want to pull someone in on a project.

You are also super funny. This is very important. I would love to see you write programming books down the line.

You asked for brutally honest feedback, and we talked about this little at Scale Up Week 1, but my concern for you is that you can sometimes focus too heavily on what other people are doing that I think can lead you to be judgmental. Your frustration when people are blocked on things or not performing well is hard to hide. I would advise you to keep working on building up your ability to assume that everyone is doing the 'best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.â€™ Not because thatâ€™s always true, but because programming is more fun if you can generally work from that assumption.

Iâ€™m really, really, really, really excited to see what you do in the next five years and beyond.

* __Ling Tran (1602):__

Erinna continued to be an amazing mentor this module. I've learned a lot under her guidance in navigating various problems. She also offered significant emotional support during a particularly stressful module for me. She was attentive in ways that was surprising. If there is one recommendation I can give to Erinna, I would say she doesn't have to be so hard on herself regarding social skills. Her team player orientation and conscientiousness are qualities that standout and anyone is able to see that. I'll miss you tremendously Erinna!

### Giving Feedback

*  __Adrienne Domingus (1511):__ (GameTime Partner)

There is no other way to describe Adrienne except that she is a BOSS (I definitely don't say this lightly). Her work habits are clockwork and she works at a crushing pace; I regularly went to bed having finished a pull request and woke up expecting to have comments and new code to look at. I have no idea what she wants out of her programming career, but she will certainly accomplish anything she puts her mind to. I look forward to continuing our pairings and hope that I will get to be involved in anything cool she works on.

* __Ling Tran (1602):__ (Paired up at various points in the module)

 I got to pair more regularly with Ling the module. She is a solid programmer and has the ability to do really challenging things. Module 3 was clearly very difficult for her; she's typically very cheerful and this module she seemed more unhappy and stressed. My recommendation would be to embrace the struggle more and to carve time out to have fun when doing serious work. I would love to continue working with her in the future because she has such enthusiasm for the projects that she's working on. Also because she is always a willing partner in finding bubble tea.

## Looking forward
### Reflections on Module 4
This module definitely flew by. I felt at times that I could be "doing more" whatever that means. This module definitely felt like I was the one responsible for scheduling things, and that really meant that I wasn't doing as much coding as I should have/wanted to be doing. Also, it felt like we built so many boxes this module... that wasn't so fun, but it was kind of fun to see the variety between basically all JavaScript, a mix of Rails/JavaScript, React.

### Reflections on Turing as a whole
I am eternally grateful for my time at Turing. I look back to where I was last year and realized that I easily could have decided to not apply, continued to do the same things I was doing, and been unable to feel confident in my career prospects. I chose Turing because somehow I felt good about the people in the community, and my expectations were exceeded many times over. I'm going to miss the basement and hopefully the basement will miss me.

Sometimes I felt like this:

But today I feel like this:

### Goals for the near future
* Spend time outdoors, take advantage of summer in Denver
* Study up on the data structures and algorithms
* Find a job
