# Erinna Chen - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
__By the end of Turing, I would like to:__
* be a rockstar! But barring that...
* have career options that incorporate my love of programming and my background in mathematics and large-scale computing
* be comfortable with using the tools and languages that enable the development of websites and applications
* be a active member of the Turing community and the development community at large
* have a portfolio that incorporates academic work and a significant number of personally-driven projects
* have strong personal relationships with students and staff of Turing and with mentors outside of Turing

__In this module, my driving principles are:__
* Consistently deliver good projects
* Continue to foster a welcoming community at Turing
* Reach out to more people outside of Turing
* Actively budget time in order to better separate academic requirements, personal development, and personal life
* Get back on the exercise train
* Push forward on some personal projects: lambda calculus, machine learning, blog, learning other programming things (elixir, python)
* Generally be more active in effectively utilizing the time/resources I have at Turing

__Three beginning of module goals:__
1. Write one technical blog post weekly (6 total)
2. Create an e-commerce website in Rails
3. Improving on interpersonal communication: Obtain at least 2 pieces of feedback from a person in each category (early, late): instructor, mentor, student in 1511, student in another cohort.


### End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluation by Andrew
* The assessment was to add a name to a level attempt and to view attempts only by a single name.
* Only thing I really suggested that Erinna work on was to evaluate what was required of the feature and be able to completely understand what will be needed from a test. This is because Erinna didn't immediately recognize the need for multiple attempts from multiple users from the beginning.

#### Notes
* I actively tried to communicate my thoughts and seek out collaboration prior to implementation.
* My familiarity with the code base felt a bit fuzzy. I should have spent a bit more time looking at the code.
* I also should have spent a bit more time looking at the problem. I felt a bit disoriented and decided to move forward first and come back to where it looked more challenging.

#### Scores
1. __Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking:__ 4
2. __Ruby Syntax & Standard Library:__ 3
3. __Rails Syntax & API:__ 4
4. __MVC & Rails Style:__ 4
5. __Testing:__ 3
6. __Collaboration:__ 4

### Mid-Module Assessment

#### Evaluation by Rachel:

#### Notes:
* Did not naturally drop into the model level for tests
* I assumed that Rachel understood where I was headed, and she probably did, but I should have been more communicative of my line of reasoning. More communication is better.
* There was minimal work with the Ruby standard library and Rails logic in this assessment.

#### Scores
1. __Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking:__ 3.5
2. __Ruby Syntax & Standard Library:__ 3
3. __Rails Syntax & API:__ 3.5
4. __Rails Style:__ 3
5. __Testing:__ 3
6. __Collaboration:__ 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Sorting Hat (non-assessed)
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/sorting-hat)
* I was paired with Allan Blair for this project

This was a four-day Rails Project involving users of different authorizations (normal and admin). The following relationships exist between the various database tables in the project:
  * Users have many points (one-to-many)
  * Users have many rewards (many-to-many)
  * Rewards have many users (many-to-many)

#### Rushing the Hour
__Overview:__
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NickyBobby/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This one-week paired project was a site-traffic analyzer, loosely similar to Google analytics. It was built using Ruby(Back-end), Sinatra(Controller), and ActiveRecord(ORM).

__Evaluation by Rachel:__
* All functionality is complete
* Need to scope event breakdown to client

__Scores:__

* Functional Expectations 3
* Test-Driven Development 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic 4
* View Layer 3

__Notes:__

* Knowing what data to use for testing was a challenge in this assignment (slow test suite is detrimental to the feedback cycle)
* Could better utilize ActiveRecord queries

#### Lucky Charms
__Overview:__
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ksk5280/lucky-charms)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Lucky Charms was a two-week long project where I worked with Kimiko Kano and Brennan Holtzclaw to build an e-commerce site that sells lucky items. The portions where I had significant contributions was:
* Partials in the views
* Using SendGrid to send emails after order confirmation
* Easter egg

## Community

### Feedback to Me

*  __Sekhar Paladugu (1508):__ (Posse-mate)

Likeliness to pair again: 5 out of 5

You are a coding boss! You are always willing to try new/different things (coding a posse challenge in Python, etc.) and are constantly improving your craft, such as using keybindings or learning simpler syntax. Both of those are amazing traits in a developer.

Because you are so far ahead of the curve in terms of students at Turing, I'd work on getting others more involved and providing the solution less, since it'll help their learning process more/allow them to talk more. Of course with posse time, it's hard to do that, and you have at so many points worked our mod 1 folks in and asked them their thoughts. My guess though is in general that your tendency is to drive more often? Just a conjecture.

Erinna = coding god (duh)

* __Nick Dorans (1511):__ (Rush Hour Partner)

Halfpoint feedback - 2/12/2016

I love how Erinna is so quick with things, not only on the keyboard (she's very fast) but with her thinking and workflow in general. It really helps me become a better and more efficient programmer.

One critique I would have about Erinna is that she might be a little too concerned about where we are in the project in relation to some of the other teams and it stresses her out a little bit. But the truth is that our pace is just fine and if we spent too much time on the earlier iterations I think that it will pay off in the end by having thought through our implementation very well. I think I do a good job of relaxing her by just making sure she knows how dedicated to completing the project I am and we will get through it together.

I'm enjoying with Erinna very much and we seem to be having a great while getting out work done. Maybe I joke around a little too much and it's something I need to work on, but I don't think it's effected our work progress too much.

Final Feedback 2/22/16

I have to reiterate one of the first points I made in my mid-point feedback. Erinna is super fast with her workflow and thought process. I'm writing this a week after the project was assessed and I've noticed that my own personal speed has increased since working with her.

The only critique I can come up with is that she made a few decisions based on what other people were doing, and our implementation was probably fine enough. Having said that, Erinna came up with some amazing code towards the end that really put our project over the top. I would say that she came up with most of the best parts of our project.

The other great thing about Erinna during the project is that she was always willing to slow down and explain things to me until I understood it. I learned a lot during this project and that was all due to Erinna.

* __Brennan Holtzclaw (1511):__ (Little Shop Partner)

When it comes to showing me what’s going on, I think you’ve done the best job of helping me through it and asking questions rather than just taking over and doing it all.
There are still times when we disagree on a choice, and it seems a little bit like my side of things doesn’t carry much weight. I think if we did a better job of explaining our stances, and the pros/cons of each, we could come to a better understanding with each other.

With the most hectic few days of the module still to go, I’m excited to get this project wrapped up together. I think we’re going to have great fun when we get into the more creative parts that are coming up.
Let’s not wait another 2 modules to pair again!

* __Allan Blair (1511):__ (Rails Mini Project Partner)

Erinna is one of the strongest if not the strongest member of 1511. Having observed her for the last few months Erinna has made strides to interact and relate with others at Turing. At times I forget she is an academic from the highest echelons of pedagogy. At other times I feel patronized or openly criticized for my thoughts and actions. Unfortunately this is reinforced with a general sense of competitiveness when collaborating with Erinna. I think the level of competitiveness when interacting with Erinna could be the root of the negativity.

In the short term Erinna could work on her collaboration by muffling her competitive nature when on a team. In the long term Erinna could work towards not feeling the need to compete with teammates at all.

* __Kris Foss (1602):__ (Posse-mate)

Erinna has been a great fixture in my posse.  She is here every day without exception.  She’s kind of a legend around here, well known in all the modules for her depth of expertise.  I have yet to see a project she can’t handle or one that even ruffles her feathers in a minor way.  She’s calm and collected and hard working.  It also seems programming is in her nature and it’s just a matter of being exposed to new things before she can do them in her sleep.  She’s been approachable and available when I’ve come to her in code desperation with a clear and logical solution.  I’m grateful that I get to spend time with her and get to know her through my posse set up.

* __Matt Pindell (1602):__ (paired with)

Occasionally you (like anyone else) can come across as brusque, this - combined with the fact that you're incredibly knowledgeable - can be misinterpreted as arrogance. I know that you have nothing but the best of intentions, and I find pairing with you to be very rewarding - but someone who is more self-conscious or more sensitive may misinterpret you and come out bruised. I think your laughter is most-often misinterpreted, you're just laughing at the situation (or just in general) and people may think you're laughing at them / their lack of knowledge. Don't stop laughing! But maybe resist the urge when talking to people about skill?
You're undeniably a strong programmer - resist the urge to compete / prove your skill - you're already crushing it.

* __Horace Williams:__ (Instructor)
Did I ever make you feel... Intimidated, Unheard
You sometimes make dismissive acknowledgements ("Yeah...") when someone is explaining or talking about something.

Hard to say if I have just gotten more comfortable working with you or if you have gotten more relaxed, but I feel less tense working with you now than when you first came to Turing. Keep up the intense intellect, but don't be afraid to soften it with some humor.

Keep bringing out the sense of humor. Try to be patient and hear people out even if you know what they are going to say or they are wrong.

I may have been an erinna skeptic at first but with more time I have really appreciated getting to know you. I think you have a really positive influence on the students (and staff) around you, even if they don't want to admit it.

### Giving Feedback
* __Sekhar Paladugu(1508):__ (Posse-mate)

I really got to know Sekhar this module through an effort to be more involved with posse. He is such a giving person, and his desire to be welcoming and inclusive towards everyone will be sorely missed when he graduates.

While pairing on posse challenges, Sekhar was a knowledgeable programmer. While I was driving, he tended to be able to read the code that I was generating and was a far more effective communicator to the new Module 1 students than I was.

I think Sekhar's weakness ties in directly to his strengths. He seems to be spread thin and can get stressed when juggling all his obligations. Perhaps, knowing when to say no will be helpful in the future. But I am completely amazed at how much of a contributor he has been to the community at Turing.

* __Nick Dorans (1511):__ (Rush Hour Partner)
Halfpoint feedback - 2/13/2016

I have really enjoyed working with you. You have been patient and encouraging when I was frustrated with ActiveRecord. You have driven collaboration even when I have wanted to work through issues by myself.

We would perhaps work a little better together if we could focus a little bit more. That would probably mean setting up pomodoros and finding the right interval time. We both seem to get really distracted,particularly with Slack and our phones (which I am fully guilty of checking too frequently as well).

I enjoy that this project has been a productive and collaborative effort and that we still have time to joke around. Those giphys are out of control (in a good way). Nickrinna 4 LiFe.

Final feedback - 2/22/2016

I thought that this was a successful collaboration. Looking back at our DTR, it seemed like most things got done. I may have mis-estimated the timing aspect of the project. You did a good job at asking questions when you were confused, and I think that definitely helped in making it feel like a collaborative effort.

I would say that we would still need to work on focusing our work efforts, the pomodoro timing really helped. Also, I think that there were some gaps in the testing, in that we didn't necessarily focus on "bad paths" when we had a time crunch towards the end of the project.

Overall, I thought we had a good project. I felt that I could honestly express my opinions throughout the project, and I learned a lot.

* __Allan Blair (1511):__ (Rails Mini Project Partner)

Allan is clearly a driven person and learns quickly. He has very strong opinions and I respect that aspect of him. His assertiveness was a bit off-putting to me when working on the mini-project. I understood that his priorities lie with other projects, and that he wanted to set a boundary in order to work on those things. I just didn't feel like there was any room for negotiation and that may have come from my own desire to be accommodating. With that said, he is a solid-programmer and is a partner that you can count on to build a good-quality product.

* __Brennan Holtzclaw (1511):__ (Little Shop Partner)

I haven't really gotten a chance to work with you before this. I think you are a far more solid programmer than you give yourself credit for.
I would recommend conveying more confidence in your the things that you know (eg. navigation in Rails, predicting how things are connected) and continuing to pause and ask questions when you don't have a good feeling of what is happening.
I am pretty psyched at how our project is going to turn out. Everything so far has gotten done (knock on wood), and I am confident in your ability to power through the challenges that we’ll face in the second half of this project.

### Playing a Part
* Ran a student-led workshop on the very basics of machine learning
* Taught a computability theory club lesson on logistic regression, attended 4 meetings of computability theory club
* Attended Go-Code-Colorado kickoff meeting
* Paired with several students in 1602
* Facilitated a GearUp
* Attended coffee hour with the Joan Clarke Society
* Tried to make Matsumoto Posse better. Made the expectation that I would be there for posse time.
* Attended improv three times

## Looking forward
### Reflections on Module 2
I would say that this was definitely a difficult module for me. I thought I would have more time for personal things; I feel like I was spread pretty thin. I felt like I spent time trying to help people and that especially early on, I didn't get the balance quite right. I underestimated how long it would take me to get through the homework assignment.

This was definitely a hard module in that we spent a significant time in groups. I'm not naturally the most effective communicator. I really struggled with allowing my partners to figure out things themselves, while also trying to push the project forward.

__Three beginning of module goals:__
1. Write one technical blog post weekly (6 total). I only wrote one. I struggle with writing and it took me way longer than I thought it would to write a good blog post.

2. Create an e-commerce website in Rails. I thought Lucky Shop was pretty successful.

3. Improving on interpersonal communication: Obtain at least 2 pieces of feedback from a person in each category (early, late): instructor, mentor, student in 1511, student in another cohort.
I did not solicit feedback early enough in the module. I will be trying to more actively take this on.


### Feedback for Turing
I think Turing has a lot of things going on for it, and some things are a work in progress. I would like to see a better mix of lessons in the beginning of Module 2. I was really tired and frustrated with the continual code-alongs. I really wish there was a second "independent" study option.

I think the struggle right now is the ability of shifting expectations without any sort of communication or choice. The posse shakeup and expectations were not clearly conveyed, and while a work-in-progress, the goals of posse were not clearly stated in any way. I would have liked to have some idea of what feedback the staff had received from the students about posse, and what they wanted posse to be. I had a similar feeling about slack and Protocol.

The announcement channel on Slack was a good change. It feels like there is a more central place to monitor for things.

### Goals
For Module 3, I want to:
* Consistently deliver good projects
* Become more comfortable in a team environment and soften my communication style
* Write a technical blog post once every two weeks.
* Continue to steadily build out new projects

## Review

### Notes

* Still exploring future option for integgrating mathematics and computing. 
* Challenge you to take intermission week to try to figure out a schedule so keep a work life balance
* Finding it challenging to nogotiate with peers
* Wants to prepare more for mentor sessions
* Gave good feedback and received feedback with a good consciousness of self
* Attended improve, joan clarke etc. 
* For mod 3 - Write 3 technical blog posts
* Technical challenges come easily to you. Challenge yourself to work well with anyteam and all teammate.


### Outcome

* Pass
