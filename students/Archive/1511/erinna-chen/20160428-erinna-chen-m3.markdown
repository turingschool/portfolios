# Erinna Chen - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
__By the end of Turing, I would like to:__
* be a rockstar! But barring that...
* have career options that incorporate my love of programming and my background in mathematics and large-scale computing
* be comfortable with using the tools and languages that enable the development of websites and applications
* be a active member of the Turing community and the development community at large
* have a portfolio that incorporates academic work and a significant number of personally-driven projects
* have strong personal relationships with students and staff of Turing and with mentors outside of Turing

__In this module, my driving principles were:__
* Consistently deliver good projects
* Become more comfortable in a team environment and soften my communication style
* Continue to steadily build out new projects

### End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluation by Nate

- Using an old version of ActiveModelSerializers
- Test coverage is great, but consider writing some unit tests for your API consumption
- Really well-formatted service and model POROs

#### Notes
* I thought that the assessment was pretty straightforward, definitely simpler than the mid-module diagnostic
* I finished the main functionality in just under 2.5 hours
* I recognized that I could have tested on the model/service level after the fact

#### Scores
1. __Ruby Style: 4:__ Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
2. __Ruby Syntax & API: 4:__ Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
3. __Testing: 3:__ Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested
4. __Progression/Completion: 4:__ Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
5. __Workflow: 4:__ Developer commits every 15 minutes

### Attendance
I was present all days this module.

### Projects

These were my individual projects:

#### API Curious (Ungraded)
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/illuminator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

This four day project required us to consume an external API and implement oAuth. The feature I implemented was to scan users repositories for Gemfiles and "illuminate" the frequency that a gem was used. Ideally, this data would be stored on a database level to speed up page load times.

#### Rails Engine
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

This four day individual project required us to serve up of data provided originally in 6 csvs in an API in Rails.

__Evaluation by Nate:__

- Can explain all your choices
- Talked about other ways to do things
- I learned something about joins, which is good, because it's poorly documented

__Scores:__

1. __Completion- 3:__ Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
2. __Test-Driven Development- 4:__ Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
3. __ Code Quality- 4:__ Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
4. __API Design- 4:__ Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
5. __Queries- 4:__ Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.


#### PAWs App (Self-directed project)
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/paws-app)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

The PAWs app take in photos and returns to the user a "best guess" for the breed if the image is recognized to be a dog. This was a two-week project which involved building two applications: a user interface in Rails with a PostgreSQL database, and a Python app that utilized the Flask web framework, the Keras machine learning library, and the VGG-16 pre-trained model for ImageNet.

__Evaluation by Nate:__

- Pushed yourself. The code suffered a little, but I think you learned a lot.
- Talked about some javascript code organization strategies. Tradeoff of CDNs
- Messy if statements can use rules engines
- Nice use of Rick Astley

__Personal Notes:__
- Heroku is the best. The Python application is still in development and not deployed.
- I definitely underestimated how much time each feature would take; also, I didn't realize how large this project would be
- Testing suffered in that I couldn't figure out what I could do/wanted to do; stress definitely contributed to this.

__Scores:__

1. __Completion- 3:__ Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
2. __Organization- 3:__ Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
3. __Technical Quality: Test-Driven Development- 3:__ Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
4. __Technical Quality: Code Quality- 3:__ Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
5. __Product Experience: User Experience- 3:__ Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
6. __Product Experience: Performance- 3:__ Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

### Extracurricular Development
These are the non-academic projects that I worked on:
  * Clarke Coin: https://github.com/erinnachen/all_the_coins
  * Began working through the books Programming Elixir and Programming Phoenix

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot
* [Github URL](https://github.com/damwhit/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

This was a 10-day Rails Project involving the pivoting of an existing e-commerce site into a "multi-tenancy" ticket selling site. This project was done in collaboration with [David Whitaker](https://github.com/damwhit) and [Chelsea Johnson](https://github.com/cheljoh). I was primarily involved in building admin functionality.

__Evaluation by Josh:__
- Worked through learning goals successfully.
- A little light on features relative to other groups. Seems like soft skills are the reason why and not so much technical reasons. Would love for each group member to make a special effort to monitor their process for future projects this module.
- Good use of Waffle and Github.
- Great use of testing.

__Personal Notes:__

- I could only describe this project as a time warp. It felt like it got off slowly and never really got up to speed.
- Looking back, the JavaScript tasks took too long
- I don't know if I felt really committed to the project

__Scores:__

1. __Feature Delivery: Completion- 3:__ Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
2. __Feature Delivery: Organization- 4:__ Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
3. __Feature Delivery: Git Workflow- 3+:__ Team always used pull requests to introduce code to their project.
4. __Technical Quality: Test-Driven Development- 4:__ Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
5. __Technical Quality: Code Quality- 3:__ Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
6. __Product Experience: User Experience- 3:__ Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
7. __Risk taking and creativity: Extensions- 2:__ Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.

## Community

### Feedback to Me

*  __Chelsea Johnson (1511):__ (Pivot Partner)

Erinna was a boss on our pivot project. She had to stamp out numerous fires started by David and myself. She also took the time to explain unfamiliar concepts to group members. At the beginning of the project, I interpreted Erinna's tone as slightly condescending when I asked for her opinion. However, this tone went away completely as the project progressed. I know she has been working on this, and it shows! Keep it up Erinna, you're awesome!

*  __David Whitaker (1511):__ (Pivot Partner)

I’ve always really admired Erinna’s willingness to help anyone in trouble.  Whether she’s working on your team or not and no matter how much time she has, she always seems to be willing to go out of her way to look at any issues your having and put out a fire if need be.  She is an extremely talented programmer and is great at staying cool under pressure.  I think that she could benefit from delegating more to her team members as I worry that she sometimes has too much on her plate.  I would love to work with her again.

* __Brennan Holtzclaw (1511):__ (Classmate)

Erinna has been a constant source of knowledge for 1511 and I certainly benefitted from that this module. She is always willing to take a few minutes out of her day to look at your problem and offer a few words of advice. Even better, if the problem is really hard she won’t leave you in a lurch, but instead she’ll work it out with you. You can tell she enjoys the work, and enjoys the challenge of solving a difficult problem. I’ve been very lucky to have class with her for so long. She has definitely grown during her time here, and I think she’s headed to do big things in the future.

* __Ling Tran (1602):__ (Hackathon group)

I did not have opportunities to pair with Erinna until this module. She knows so much!!! Despite being a genius, Erinna does not possess an ounce of arrogance. She cares for the community and uses her technical strengths and encouragement to prop others up. I am impressed by how Erinna manages her time, juggling projects with her participation in various time-consuming activities. How does she do it?! I am not sure. I hope to learn as much as possible from Erinna before she finishes Turing. Thanks for all that you do, Erinna!

### Giving Feedback
* __Brennan Holtzclaw (1511):__ (Classmate)

I always enjoy pairing with Brennan. It feels like he is naturally very-communicative, and when working with him, I find myself trying to mimic this. I definitely think that Brennan is hard on himself; the problems he has approached me with are not straightforward, but it feels that he sometimes goes to a place of "I'm not a good enough programmer to figure this out." As long as Brennan keeps challenging himself, he'll be an asset to any team.

* __David Whitaker (1511):__ (Pivot Partner)

David is a great programmer to have on your team. He's by far one of the most positive people I have worked with, and even under stress that does not change. I really respect his communication style; he clearly expresses what he knows and what he doesn't know. David should work on just expanding his technical skills, but I believe that will come with time. I would work with David pretty much on anything at this point.

* __Chelsea Johnson (1511):__ (Pivot Partner)

I would say I did not know Chelsea very well before working with her on the pivot, and working with her was a different experience than I thought it would be. She has great insight into the code she writes and is far more serious than I thought she would be.

I think Chelsea's process in tackling something new is to freak out about the complexity. I think she should trust her abilities more and drive development more with testing because it would allow her to tackle the smaller parts of a problem (and the edge cases) without worrying too much about how large a problem could be.

I'm not sure we really want to re-visit the pivot, but I would love to pair more with Chelsea. There is always excitement and dance parties to look forward to.


* __Ling Tran (1602):__ (Paired on Clarke Coin Hackathon day)

Ling is an enthusiastic programmer (and person), and I commend her for being willing to jump into the Clarke coin project even if the material was intimidating. I think Ling struggles a bit with conveying how serious she actually is, so I think that she should work on learning to communicate her discomfort and knowledge honestly and more forcefully. I look forward to getting to pair more with her in the future.

### Posse takeaways
I feel like this iteration of posses was more effective than say the other modules. But, I'm still a bit unclear about how I can lead an engaged posse. I think the support aspect of posse is very cool and probably very useful for Module 1. It didn't seem like Module 1'ers got out of Classroom A very much this module and I think it would be cool to have more integration through the modules.

I enjoy the mentors for their knowledge when questions arose. It might be interesting to try to engage them on a more regular basis working on some sort of project. It would be nice to be guided sometimes.

### Playing a Part
* Ran a student-led workshop session on Elixir basics
* Wrote a GearUp document
* Attended coffee hour with the Joan Clarke Society
* Led a group for the Hackathon
* Participated in Armstrong and Hopper Posse activities
* Attended meetings of Clojure with Horace

## Looking forward
### Reflections on Module 3
This was by far my favorite module. I really felt like I got to have freedom to work individually, and I really tried to push myself. I believe that I have a solid grasp on the mechanics of Rails, and would like to explore the more advanced features of Rails.

Something I really struggled with throughout the module was time-management. I felt like I spent a lot of time trying to help others. Also, I definitely under-estimated the amount of time some features would take to implement.

One thing that I noticed in getting time to work by myself was that I did not receive feedback on my code. I did not feel like I needed help to figure things out, but I could have used some extra eyes on code.

### Feedback for Turing
Module 3 is hard, and fatigue, stress and fear/uncertainty, are contributors to the difficulty. I think something that is rather underrated is honest and positive feedback. I feel like many people question whether they will have a job or pass the module or whatever, and that insecurity is likely to be un-founded, and positive assurance (or action steps) can go a long way.

### Goals
For Module 4, I want to:
* Get super comfortable with JavaScript
* Work on improving my workflow when under time constraints or when working on novel things
* Be deliberate on meeting people for networking purposes
* Polish my projects

* E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3

### Notes

- To speak about the `J` for individual work, we had a really good conversation about Erinna's ability as a developer, and what her focus is, and how Turing's standard lessons and projects didn't do the best job of letting her grow where she wanted to grow, but she did a great job of growing where she wanted to grow, while still giving a real try at the stuff we asked for that she didn't want to do. The `J` is meaningless, other than to communicate that I didn't want to reduce her experience here to a number.

### Outcome
