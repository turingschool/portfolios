### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to become more proficient with JavaScript. My plan to achieve this goal was to work hard, refactor and ask for review of said code. I believe I have met these goals because I feel very confident in my skills in ES5. I hope to continue learning industry standards and move to ES6. Here are some [future goals!](https://gist.github.com/Tman22/24fdcd674e0d06f6918880b605b1fbac).

I also wanted to commit everyday of this module.. because my GitHub needs some love. Although I didn't achieve this goal, I feel I have deserve a B for effort! [GitHub](https://github.com/Tman22).
The new goal is revised to keep up commits to at least 5 times a week.

## Projects

#### IdeaBox

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0/taylor_moore.md)

A place to put ideas.

Points: 152/150

#### Scale Up! Whiskey Tango!

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/scale-up-wk-5/template-whiskey-tango.markdown)

The point of this project was to jump into an old code base and begin to fix what was broken. The project chosen was from Mod 3. It was a music playlist generator for Spotify. It could either generate more specific Discovery Weekly or Group playlist allowing people to listen to what their friends are.

Points:
  - Scale Up Week 4: 150/150
  - Scale Up Week 5: 150/150

Feedback:
  - You did a great job on this project. Despite what was going on outside of Turing, you powered through and you did a great job. We are so impressed with how you handled the last couple of weeks and what you accomplished. It's hard to get back into an older (potentially messy) project and refactor it. You worked through frustration and feeling discouraged, hit major speed bumps, and overcame them to end up with something that will be fantastic to talk about in interviews. Really good job. Infinity high fives.

### Team Project

#### CannonZ AKA GameTime Woot!

* Partner Nick Dorans
* [GitHub](https://github.com/Tman22/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1511/module_4_assignments/gametime/naylor)

The point of the game is to hit all the targets on each level. You can rotate the cannon using the up/down arrows on the keyboard and press spacebar to shoot. The power bar on the left side of the screen goes up and down continuously and you have to time your shots just right to hit the targets.

Points:
- GameTime Check In 1 50/50
- GameTime Check In 2 50/50
- GameTime Check In 3 35/50
  - Missing moving targets being hooked up
    bugginess around collision detection
- GameTime Final Points 147/150

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Brennan:
  - It was very sad to lose Brennan in 1510, he would have greatly contributed to #Keep1510Weird. So, you can imagine how happy I was to regain his compony when I joined 1511. Brennan works extremely hard to produce quality code and always has time to lend an ear. At any point he was willing to listen or comment on a PR. I not only enjoyed learning from him but I quickly felt that I gained a friend.  During his time at Turing he was away from his wife, a crucial support system, yet still managed to start the podcast and work very hard. I admire Brennan and can't wait to see what his future holds. I hope to stay in touch!

Nick:
  - Nick was one of the first people to welcome me to 1511. We had talked a few times during Mod 2 and 3 and I started to realize how much he does for Turing. Not only was he famous for the Emoji's but he also really brought a lot of people together and kept them laughing. So I had the pleasure of working with Nick for GameTime. During the 2 weeks Nick worked very hard! He had many ideas and lots to contribute. Nick and I didn't always agree but he did a great job to communicate his ideas. This makes Nick a great team member and I'm sure will do well at any company he ends up at!

Julian:
  - Julian is a master at JavaScript. When I needed help he always took the time to work through bugs and explain why ES5 was so messed up. He continuously told me that this was fixed in ES6. Though I never got to work with Julian, I know he would have made a great teammate! His ability to work hard, communicate and to debug will serve him very well. Good luck Julian!

### Being a Community Member

Brennan:
  - Taylor was an amazing part of the #1510 machine, and I think he was a great addition to #1511. He always has a positive attitude and encouragement when you're not feeling like a project is going well .His obvious knowledge of Javascript was a big help to many members of #1511 as we struggled into the JS forest. His competitive nature also means that he's always trying to up his game, and by doing so he is challenging everyone to rise to his level. That attitude was not only good for the knowledge of the class, but for our morale as well. When you throw on the fact that he was job hunting, actively interviewing, and secretly stressing about his own problems, it just shows how good of a person he is.
  I think Taylor is going places soon, and I look forward to seeing what that will be. ![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/LVbeDr6Wx1hgk/giphy.gif)

Nick:
- I was really glad that Taylor joined our cohort this module. There was a part of me that had a hard time letting go to 1510, so he was the piece of 1510 that we were all able to hold on to. We had a conversation about possibly building a game together back at the end of mod 3, so naturally I wanted to work with him for Game Time. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working with him. We worked extremely hard and put in a lot of late nights to figure out the logic/math behind making the game work. It was a little buggy and dirty early on in the project, but then we went into high gear to refactor and fix the bugs in our code. Once we refactored our code we were able to test every single component in isolation. We ended up with a very solid test suite. Our communication was also very good and we were able to talk through all of our problems to come up with the best solutions. Occasionally we would type over each other while pair programming, but thatâ€™s only because we both naturally want to drive. It was never an issue. I think Taylor is a great person to pair with and a fun guy to be around. Hopefully we both stay in Denver and can hang out moore (you see what I did there) in the future. He would be an absolute asset to any team!

Julian:
- Having to join another module during your time at Turing can be a difficult thing. Luckily, Taylor is as easy going as it gets! Here exudes the typical Midwestern demeanor that lends him to being calm, cool and collected. He is always willing to ask for help and picks up quickly on a new topic. Though it has only been 6 weeks, I am glad that we got to have Taylor for that time. Go forth and kick some ass dude!


### Playing a Part

- I joined Micro-Posse 5, helping students in the morning when needed.
- I led sessions for GearUp, taking it very seriously. and trying to allow everyone to have a voice.
- Cleaned and picked up in the mornings.
- Wrote and posted a blog on Medium.
- Helped some mod 3 students during Rails Engine.
- Went to every guest speaker except for the first one to support our community.. and to learn stuff.
- I started Karaoke Night.. Then tried to stop it once I realized I went to far. "Once the monster was released there was nothing I could do to stop it." - Undocumented quote from Victor Frankenstein

## Future Part
 - I plan to go to meet ups
 - Keep my education growing to make ya'll proud. Especially to show off at said meet ups.
 - Post jobs when I hear of them.
 - Brag to all of the people about my experience at Turing
 - Attempt to mentor(probably focus on finding a job first)
