# Deborah Hamel - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

#### Goals
With Module 2, I want to gain confidence and skill with Rails. Additionally, I want to focus on improving my testing skills and push myself to improve my algorithmic skills. I want to consider my learning style and evaluate if I need to make any strategic adjustments.

#### Results
I have learned so many new things about rails and app development. I don't feel like I was able to practice and perform diligent test driven development workflow on projects. I hope to keep reaching for this practice and expertise.

I did try tracking in Trello again this module, but still feel a bit of inefficiency and chaos around structuring my study time and practice.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Josh Washke:** :I paired with Josh on the Rush Hour project and like every other project I have worked on with Josh, he is extraordinary. He consistently demonstrates advanced skills in project management, coding ( in multiple languages) and an ability to instantly absorb and become efficient with new techniques. He is also a great teacher, patient with pairing partners and  one of the kindest people in our cohort - although a bit under the radar. Like to see him come out of his shell more, but feel SO lucky to consider him my friend.

>**Beth Sebian:** :Beth - You are passionate, brave and I love working with you. You make things happen and offer the discipline, accountability and leadership that helps others rise to challenges and stay on task. Working with you and the Pahlka Posse this module was my favorite project. The Hackathon with the Affordable Housing app was so much fun and I learned so much. I felt very confident participating in each part of that day. Keep raising that bar for others and yourself. I believe you can change the world as an skilled developer and activist.

>**Matt Pindell:** Matt -  Working with you on Rush Hour was a pleasure. You are so smart and tenacious. You are easy to work with and have a stunning work ethic and badass coding skills. I really appreciated your encouragement for me drive during our project. You give Turing a positive, passionate and hilarious heartbeat every single day! You don’t have to be so agreeable all the time.

>**Mark Miranda:** Mark is an amazing project manager. I feel lucky to have worked with him on the LittleShop project. His leadership skills and artfully collaborative workflow are only exceeded by his strong and insightful coding skills. He can just get things done. He hardly every gets stuck, but is always willing to help others and work through issues. He is so easy to get along with and finds ways for a team to feel consistently cohesive and on track. Sometimes I think he puts others first and sacrifices his own time and priorities. I would encourage him to always remember to take care of himself too.

>**Ling Tran:** Ling is one of the smartest and most insightful members of the Turing community. She has taken time to pair with me multiple times and I always learn something about coding and  something about myself. She is focused, and effective in her work style. She is honest, caring and so much fun. She is a talented programmer and will be very successful. I hope she will overcome some of the irrational anxiety that crops up for her, but I do also love her softer side.

### Being a Community Member

>Deb is an amazing teammate. She was the spirit of the team and kept our stress level low and the project moving in the right direction. She was always ready with solutions when walls in thought process or code came up. She helped keep the lines of communication open when we were approaching stressful times and deadlines by just talking through things. A skill that is easily overlooked as something that changes the dynamic of groups. My only criticism for Deb is that she needs to be more confident in her opinions. She has a lot of knowledge and skill, but seems to doubt herself when a problem arises.  I would be happy to be in a group with Deb anytime.-**Mark Miranda**

 >I've had a chance to work with Deborah through our work in Pahlka posse, and I've found her to be an engaged member of the team who elevates those around her. She is upbeat, dedicated but grounded, and enthusiastic about her work, all of which have had a positive impact on our team dynamic. I've also had a chance to interact with Deborah in environment variables and more casually as a fellow Turing student. I see her go to great lengths to support the students around her -- she does so in a genuine and authentic way that I find quite powerful. Turing is lucky to have her in our community.-**Beth Sebian**

>Deb! It was awesome to work with you again on Rush Hour. You continue to develop into a stronger programmer every time I work with you. I feel like I’m endlessly repeating myself but work on that confidence! Its obvious you have ideas for how to implement things but have a difficult time typing out your opinions in code when you think someone is watching. Know that your group mates aren’t judging you and that hearing more opinions and ways of doing something is a great way to learn and can only help when in a group situation. You are way better at this than you think you are. Work on believing you can do this, because I’ve spent a lot of time watching you code over the last 2 modules and I know you can.-**Josh Washke**

>Deb was great to pair with on the Rails MiniProject.  She stepped outside of her comfort zone to accommodate me by allowing us to do most of the project remotely via ScreenHero.  It was a little difficult at times but she dealt with it gracefully.  She was engaged every step of the way which helped me to keep focus.  She also kept a great attitude throughout and made it a very fun and enjoyable project to do.  She took the initiative to style our project during times when we weren’t both working on it.  I reaallllllyyyy appreciated that.  Overall Deb was great to work with and willing to go out of her way to help in any way.-**Drew Thompson**

>Deb has a tremendous work ethic and is one of the most compassionate and caring spirits at Turing. When we paired a few times this module, she demonstrated her knowledge of the content but only after encouragement. I think a factor that underlies her timidity is self-doubt, which is KURAZY because she is super smart and can speak about the content. Another contributing factor is that she gets ahead of herself in the thought process before coding anything, which can get her in a pickle. If Deb can figure out how to simply focus without getting loss in her head, she is GOLDEN. Also, I am grateful for having.-**Ling Tran**


>I really enjoyed being in a group with Deb.  She always brought her all and jumped in with a positive attitude.  She’s energetic and engaged and a lot of fun.  She’s passionate and determined and makes an effort to truly understand each part of the material.  She doesn’t cut corners and she works to find the best possible solution.  She was resolute in reaching the end of a challenging task and would always encourage us.  She perseveres through her own challenges and obstacles and knows herself well and what she needs to do to get to where she wants to be.  I hope her unwearied efforts will continue and she will continue to foster that greatness inside of her.  I can also say I really appreciate her kindness and nurturing nature.  When things are challenging, Deb is a loving glue that keeps people together.  She’s a great addition to any team.-**Kriss Foss**

>Deb! You are always such a pleasure to talk to!  I haven’t been in a group project with you, but whenever we pair it’s always such a great time because you’re an amazing person to get along with. I know you’ll do well at turing because you look at everything with a silver lining, even when it’s not going your way.  Thanks for being so welcoming to me when we first met and immediately taking me on as a new friend.  I always look forward to pairing with you, and I know that if we get teamed up on project it will be a blast because you are such a great teammate, and so easy to get along with.-**Jon Liss**
