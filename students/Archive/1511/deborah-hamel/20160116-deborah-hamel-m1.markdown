# Deborah Hamel - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Coming into Module 1 I wanted to see if I could become a confident programmer. I wanted to see if I could manage a big life change and be capable of learning something really hard and new after years of doing predictable things. I hoped to increase my understanding of object-oriented programming and problem solving and build up productive and strategic personal learning practices.

Enigma uses Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Assessed by: Andrew Carmer

Notes:
* Needs to really work on TDD. The code isn't too bad overall, but didnt get all functionality out and looks like the student really struggled with implementing the little pieces.

### Giving Feedback

###### For Sunny:
Sunny is a connector. His chill attitude and earnest enthusiasm perpetuates through all obstacles and struggles and creates an atmosphere of positivity and tenacious energy for everyone.  Pairing with Sunny has been perhaps one of the richest and most influential experiences of my time here. We faced many challenges pairing on Headcount and I am so grateful for the openness, generosity and adaptability Sunny consistently brought to the project. Sunny is dedicated and passionate about coding and gets into a zone when he is grinding through options and chasing down bugs. Sometimes it is hard to interject things when he gets into a zone, but who can fault him for loving the coding jam so much. He will be a voracious learner as a programmer and I can't wait to see the cool and unique things he will develop.

###### For Nick W.:
Nick is infinitely curious, strategic, excellent and lovable. I can't wait to see the uniquely insightful things he will do with a programming skill set. His depth and intelligence have inspired me and challenged me to look above and beyond the obvious. Sometimes I feel Nick is at a whole different level and in his own world, but in little and big ways he has opened up and offered  support whenever I was in need. So grateful that Nick is here.

###### For Adrienne:
Adrienne is one of the most caring and disciplined people in our cohort. This is a powerful combination. I don't think she fully appreciates the strength and beauty in her vulnerable side. I hope she knows how much it has meant to me to see someone so successful be vulnerable too. She inspires me to keep doing my best and has been a cheerleader whispering in my ear when I most needed it.

###### For Julian:
Julian Feliciano is someone that increases the capacity of the whole. Our cohort is made more capable and egoless by his collaborative generosity and genuine, selfless commitment. Thanks to Julian, I know what an exorcism is and our entire cohort has an extra resource in their toolbox. His work ethic is inspiring, but I would encourage him to treat himself with the same kindness and generosity that he has shown everyone else around him.

###### For Erinna:
Erinna has been my hero. She has been there for me as a counselor and code coach at all hours. She paired with me and Sunny for an intense TDD session during our Headcount project that moved us from stuck to a collaborating pair. Her excellence is only exceeded by her selfless support of everyone that might be struggling or need help.

###### For Russell:
Russell took the time to help me practice TDD from a blank page even though he had his own work to do. This helped me enormously. Things that are really hard for me right now, come so easy to him. Getting to know him has also been an unexpected surprise. We are so different, yet Turing let us cross paths and I truly appreciate the chance to see the world through his lens.  I hope he stays open to people like me getting to know him better.

###### For Bret D.:
Brett found me floundering and stuck with Linked Lists and took the time to pair with me. He helped me understand some complex topics by talking through the logic with some of the most entertaining and useful dry-erase marker scenarios the world has every seen. He made me feel confident and never once emphasized what a newbie I was. Bret seems shy, and a bit self conscious but he was my hero on Linked Lists.

### Being a Community Member

###### From Nick W.:
As she would say (not about herself; see \*humility), Deborah is an ‘emitter’.  Her positivity is infectious and her \*humility gives her a unique ability to build up everyone she interacts with. Unfortunately, this last quality has some adverse effects—A tendency to doubt herself has led to morphed view of her own abilities as a programmer. She has very insightful design ideas and a dedication to TDD that consistently challenges my urge to reject TDD when working with smaller code challenges. I have learned a lot from standing next to her during lectures in Classroom A and I’m excited to see what she accomplishes as her programming  confidence builds.

###### From Adrienne:
Deb has a wonderful positive impact on group dynamics. She gives people positive feedback unsolicited, and builds others up around her. My advice to her would be to be patient with herself, give herself the time she needs without worrying so much about comparing herself to others. The growth that she has shown over the past weeks has been incredible, as is the effort she's put in and I know she'll continue on that trajectory.

###### From Sunny:
Deb is a real joy to have in class. She’s very easy going and has such a natural charm about her that can always lighten a situation. She’s extremely kind and caring and is always there for people in a very authentic way. Im currently pairing with her on the Headcount project and I consider myself very lucky, however I was a bit apprehensive when I saw that I was paired with her for this major project. Some of our weaknesses are not exactly the most complimentary. I think it was somewhere around day 3 when we were in a pretty deep hole and I was feeling a bit pessimistic about the whole thing that I was able to see her real character. I never saw her falter. I know she has a lot on her plate, but you wouldn’t know it. She has a determination and resolve that will get her through anything. I am seriously in awe. She’s great, and she is going to be an amazing programmer, I just hope she sees it as well.

###### From Heidi:
Deborah’s personality is one of the most standout in our module. Her unique ability to instantly understand a situation and respond with forethought and and perception has the potential to also be how she can respond in technical situations. She is innately gifted in communication and puts people at ease with her sweet but determined nature.  I feel as her exposure and practice with code expand she will find her natural equilibrium.

###### From Bret D:
I paired with Deborah on Linked Lists - she was enthusiastic, hard-working, and responsive. It was a pleasure working with her. She asked clear and articulate questions and when faced with a challenged worked diligently through it. I enjoyed paring with her and would like to again!
