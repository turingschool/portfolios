Notes

No BI endpoints
I like what you did with controllers and routes
The testing looks clean. We talked about some "cowboy'd" tests, but they were pretty simple functionality anyway

Notes:

Remember to buy Nate a big hat
Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

 ### Attendance

 I think only one missed day this mod (hackathon day).


 ### Giving Feedback

 For Brennan
 I really enjoyed working with Brennan on the Pivot. He's a far stronger contributor than he gives himself credit for being.
 He seems to approach large problems with resignation to the task that might make one image a man assigned the job of moving
 a mountain a handful of rocks at a time. He shrugs, rolls up his sleeves, and gets to work. The Pivot can be a slog and the
 patient diligence he brought to the project was a valuable asset to progress but the sense of humor he brought to the team
 made many of the would-be-slog moments quite enjoyable. He'll be a terrific asset to whatever team is lucky enough to have him.

 ### Being a Community Member
 Beth Secor (Little Shop):
 Working with Lenny again was a pleasant throwback to module 1. I feel like Lenny and I have very similar working/learning styles (though I may be way off, it’s impossible to really know The Lenny). He seems to be most interested in drilling down to a real understanding of the material at hand. Whenever he encounters a problem he takes the time to dig down into what the problem is, and how to logically solve it. I liked working through problems with Lenny during The Pivot. Since we managed to stay paired up even after The Pivot pivot He was the person I spent most time working with this module. It was a great experience, and I think it taught me a lot about how we both learn. I’ve really loved having Lenny at Turing. I hope that if he leaves us we, as figments of his imagination, don’t cease to exist. :lennys_imagination: :
