# Thom Pickett - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Not knowing what to expect coming into Turing, I was excited and nervous about the possibilities. I started this path of software engineering so that I would be challenged and have to grow to succeed. I specifically chose this field because of the challenges it puts on myself, it also gives me the opportunity to create and make a difference in the world.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

* Working with Jeff on "Highest Scoring Word"
* Already planning to repeat
* Some hesitation with arguments
* Need to work on enumerables like sort_by and group_by
* Need to use pseudocode to help work out steps before writing code

#### Scores

* 2: Ruby Syntax & API - Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

* 2: Ruby Style - Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity      

* 2: Blocks & EnumerationsBlocks & Enumerations - Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

*  3: Testing - Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

*  3: Workflow - Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

* 3: Collaboration - Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Mid Module Assessment

#### Notes

Evaluated on 4 Jan 2016 by Lovisa Svallingson.

- developer needs more practice with Ruby syntax. Go through more of the mythical creatures exercises to get more comfortable how to use methods and instance variables

#### scores

* 2: Ruby Syntax & API - Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

* 2: Ruby Style - Developer does not refactor for clarity

* 3: Testing - Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

* 3: Workflow - Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

* 3: Collaboration - Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

I missed two days the fifth week, but worked from home on my projects.

## Work

### Projects

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

##### Description
The purpose of this project was to design a linked list using incursion or recursion. We also had to create methods to modify our linked list.
#### Notes and Scores

__Comments:__

* good pass at most of the fundamental list logic
* left some gaps especially around the single node / empty edge cases
* things to focus on are really carefully pseudocoding each case so  that we make sure we account for it both in the tests and in the  implementation
* need to keep hammering on these fundamental dev processes to avoid getting overwhelmed or lost in the problem

__Scores:__
* Functional Expectations 2
* TDD 2
* Encapsulation 3
* Ruby Style and Fundamentals 2
* Looping / Recursion 3

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thompickett/crypto.rb)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

##### Description
The purpose of this project was to use enumerables in a real context. To practice TDD to break our program up into logical components. It's called crypto on my github page and rubric.

#### Notes and Scores

__Comments:__

* Project does not run via command line- encrypt decrypt or crack.
* Not a lot to show from this project so it's hard to draw a major conclusion. There was some separation of logical components, but some leakage in encrypt. Encrypt had decrypting going on too.
* Not a lot of tests, but the ones that are there do test come core functionality.

__Scores:__
* Overall Functionality 1
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 2.5
* Test-Driven Development 1.5
* Breaking Logic into Components 2

## Team

### Projects

#### Http Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL class project](https://github.com/thePaulista/http_yeah_you_know_me.git)
* [GitHub URL second attempt](https://github.com/thompickett/http_yeah_you_know_me_again.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

##### Description
In this project we built a server to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web. It was also the first project we worked on as a team. Above I linked my second attempt at this project that I worked on with my mentor.
#### Notes and Scores

__Comments:__

* Introduce abstractions to remove repetition
* Watch indentaiton
* Don't have old code in your repo :)
* Tests all pass
* Excellent names on the tests
* Tested shutdown... mostly
* I love your thread!
* Good job separating routing into controller and not server
* Push parsing down into some other class (maybe          "Parser" or "Request" or something)

__Scores:__
* Overall Functionality
Score: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style
Score: 3
* Test-Driven Development
Score: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components
Score: 3


## Community

### Giving Feedback
Scott Firestone and I worked on the http pre project before winter break. We had a lot of fun trying to parse it even if it wasn’t the most successful endeavor. He keeps a really great attitude and continually contributes ideas and solutions to move forward.

Dan Winter has been helping me on Tuesday mornings since my second week at Turing. Dan approached me about it while at lunch, so I didn’t even have to ask. He’s found where I’ve been struggling and than walked me through it. Doing an amazing job of asking pointed questions to make me think, so I can arrive at the answer rather than giving it to me.

Brennan asked a lot of questions while we paired on logic gates. He forced me to question why I wanted to complete the solution a certain way. He also did an superb job of sharing responsibility for the work, and directing the flow. I enjoyed the time working together.

I paired with Heidi on Headcount on the cross team pairing exercise. I was not doing the final, and so did not know what all was going on in it. Heidi was an amazing pair.
She slowed down and walked me through her logic up to that point, so that  we could work on some refactoring for the couple of hours the exercise lasted.

### Being a Community Member
Brennan Holzclaw - Thom was great to work with. When we paired during class he had a different approach (and much simpler) to the problem than I did, and it meant that I was able to learn out of a lesson I’d already done before. He’s always a positive source, and just a generally a great guy to be around.

Scott Firestone - Thom and I paired on an exercise involving HTTP headers, without any introductory lesson, which was described as “impossible” by the instructor when assigned. Thom was motivated by the challenge. He showed a genuine curiosity and interest in figuring out solutions, contributing various ideas for testing and implementation. His positive attitude makes him a joy to work with.  While his understanding of Ruby has some room to grow, his motivation to work hard and learn leaves no doubt in my mind that he will acquire the skills needed to be an adept developer.

Heidi Hoopes - I enjoy hearing Thom’s comments in classroom conversations because he is deliberate and methodical about his thinking. While pairing with him on a project unfamiliar to him, he was patient and focused, and quickly caught the gist of the problem.

### Playing a Part

I showed up to support Kids Who Code on their presentation night. After telling my fiancee about it, she became curious and asked me to find out the details. She's a kindergarten teacher and has a kid in her class who excelled in both logic and a basic "coding" program they used in class. I found out the details from George Hudson, so that she could pass them on to her student's parent and hopefully he'll come in the following weeks.

I've helped organize and participated in social activities with other students outside of Turing such as climbing and board games. I've also loaded and unloaded the dishwasher, and made coffee several times.
