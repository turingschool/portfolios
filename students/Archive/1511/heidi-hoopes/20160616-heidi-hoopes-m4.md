### Areas of Emphasis

I am excited to have the time, space, and choice to dig down deep on more advanced issues, particularly back-end work. I'd like to improve my database and devop skills. But I am also looking forward to improving my knowledge of the second computer language that I know (well). JavaScript gets both a bad rap but also a lot of attention and it seems mastery of it will open a different type of job. I'm also excited to have a microposse, to continue driving my posse with Cheljoh, and to have fun with being the "seniors" and setting a culture, pace, and expectations. 

I received 988/1138 points for the module.

### End of Module Assessment

Had enough points that I was not obligated to take it though I did work on it

### Work

#### Idea Box

[Gist](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1511/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0/heidi_hoopes.md)

Idea Box is a Turing assignment allotted 3-1/2 days to quickly ramp up skills in JS and AJAX with an internal API. It's fully realized through AJAX in a single page and allows a user to create, edit, and delete ideas, as well as upvote and downvote the quality of the idea. Additionally, a realtime search provides case-insensitive results without page reloads.

### Projects

#### GameTime (Puts-Puts Golf)

[Production](brennanholtzclaw.github.io/game_time)

[Gist](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1511/module_4_assignments/gametime/puts-puts)

Puts-Puts Golf is a JavaScript game that has a cartoony-mask that belies its tough collision-detection center. Don't put money up against fluffy marshmallow when balls hitting obstacles are on the line. You can play golf. You can go horribly over par, and it will tell you.

#### Scale Up

[LookingFor GitHub](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)

[Deployed](https://lookingforme.herokuapp.com/)

I worked on the Rails back-end team for our Looking For job finder web app. My role initially was to provide a means to seed a huge database and research performance options, for which I wrote a task that would generate data. Then for the second week I coordinated more with the front-end team to create and customize new API endpoints.

ScaleUp Week 1: 150 pts

ScaleUp Week 2: 150 pts

### Giving Feedback

Brennan Holtzclaw:

Working with Brennan on two projects in the last 6 weeks gave me a good insight into his work ethic. While he always invests a lot of thought and solid code into his own PRs, he also jumps easily into reviewing others' code and provides good feedback. He solved major bugs we had with our JavaScript-based game and was indispensable as a teammate. I believe that any workplace would benefit not only from his code skills, but also from his easy-going support of the others around him.

Nate Venn:

Within the last 6 weeks, I was privileged to work with Nate on two team projects and both times was impressed with his reliability, solid code, and quickness to dig down into new technologies. Besides his technical skills, Nate was also a pleasure to work with personally, having a chill personality that will mesh in any workplace. He supports his teammates and ships good code, at the same time.

Chelsea Johnson: 

Chelsea is the perfect ally to have on a project. She architected the mission for the posse that we co-led this module and was always organized, on-time, and engaging. She has both the patience and direction to lead the junior students which the posse attracted, but also the technical chops to do whatever is required. I love seeing her projects because they're always fun, inspired, and technically challenging. She will make a responsible yet dashingly fun addition to a team. Go cheljoh go!

### Being a Community Member

Brennan Holtzclaw:

Heidi Hoopes had the misfortune to work with me on two different projects this module. Fortunately this meant we got the chance to really get to know each other's workflow and [collaborate like pros](http://giphy.com/gifs/cheezburger-pokemon-pikachu-3oEduV4SOS9mmmIOkw). Working with Heidi is a joy. She knows what's going on, where the project is headed, and always has multiple ideas for steering there safely. Heidi will also put you to shame with her work ethic. When you put in a full day and feel good about what you've done, Heidi has worked longer and gotten more done. If I had a criticism it might be around this. Some times I would want her to just take a minute away from being such a badass to relax for a bit. You can tell that Heidi always gives 100-percent, even when she has things happening in her personal life. She was always there in Game Time and Scale Up to give a code review, help solve a problem, and make sure that issues were getting closed and merged.

I will miss being able to work with Heidi, and there will be no replacing her.

Nate Venn: 

Heidi is such an inspiration to me and our entire cohort. I dont know how she
can get so much accomplished in one day. She produces quality code, is
constantly answering questions on slack, mentoring other students, organizing
events, and runs a posse. Not to mention she has a full time job of being a
parent. Heidi inspires me to do more and be better. Before our Game Time
partners we anounced I said to myself that I really wanted to get a chance to
work with Heidi. And as fate would have it, that wish came true. Heidi is one of the
hardest working partners that I have had at Turing, and the smartest. She can
figure and reason with just about any problem. She also really cares about her
teammates and their wellbeing. I continually touched by her kindness and strength.

Chelsea Johnson:

I have really enjoyed getting to know Heidi. Not only is she an extremely talented developer, but she is also kind, caring, and optimistic. I have enjoyed being a posse leader with her and have learned a lot pairing with her. When developing, she is not afraid of taking on challenges and seeks elegant solutions to her problems. Heidi is always thinking of others; she takes time to volunteer for Kids Who Code and helped with a micro posse this module. Heidi is going to do a great job in her student support role at Turing!

### Playing a Part

* Facilitated Miyamoto posse again with Chelsea Johnson
* Led a microposse with Kimi Kano and came every day
* Met with my prework student at the beginning of the module to check in with him and buy him lunch
* Attended a couple more Kids Who Code meetings/demo
* Cleaned for the Try Turing event and TA'ed all day for the Saturday portion
* Paired with several Mod 1 and Mod 3 students outside of my microposse, including 4 Mod 3 projects this week alone (what, do I have a sticker on my back that says "student support"?)
* And the thing I'm most proud of for its difficulty, I kept the Turing plants alive
