# Heidi Hoopes - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Module 3 for me was a chance to learn the technologies to create the cool projects I've been thinking about for awhile, even beyond the start of Turing. Solutions to tech problems are never fixed in stone or prescriptive, and solving that requires a lot of personal study and experimentation. I felt like Mod 3 offered the chance to still participate in obligatory assignments, but in a manner that encourages that personal experimentation.

### End of Module Assessment

- Items do not include a name, as they should in the spec. Instead they contain an id.
-  Unclear on the model/service pattern. Functional, but not well organized
- Good request specs. Could have more unit tests for API consumption.

##### Ruby Style

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

##### Rails Syntax & API
​
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
​
##### Testing
​
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

##### Progression/Completion
​
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
​
##### Workflow
​
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

### Work

Note: API Curious was a graded project for me. I assisted on The Pivot for about 2-1/2 days.

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hhoopes/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Project purpose: replicate the functionality of a self-picked API. I chose 23 and Me (a direct-to-consumer genome mapping service). While there was an OAuth gem available, it didn't work quite right for my project, so I wrote my own authentication methods. As a result, some of my feature delivery and testing suffered, though the instructor review (Josh Meija) still gave a 3 on features for writing my own OAuth piece.

##### Feature Delivery
Completion
3: Developer delivered all planned features.

Organization
3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

##### Technical Quality
Test-Driven Development

1: Project does not have 70% test coverage

##### Product Experience
User Experience

3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/rales-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/hhoopes/sales_engine)

> Students have to use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.


##### Feature Delivery
Completion

3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

##### Technical Quality
Test-Driven Development

3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

Code Quality

4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

API Design

4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

Queries

4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

* Good Routes/Controller combination. Looks like there was some experimentation here
* Good use of serializers
* Didn't try using enumerables for missing BI endpoints

#### Self-Directed Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hhoopes/genome_match_maker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Description:
I continued using the 23 And Me API, creating a service that connects users who have their genome mapped with researchers who are studying specific mutations.

Instructor Feedback (as transcribed by me):
* User experience was lacking with some views where the elements based on the grid stacked oddly.
* It's ok that a lot of the actual "matchmaking" relied on Ruby rather than Active Record, given the complexity of the numerous relationships, polymorphism, and two kinds of users.  
* Features seemed scaled back some

Completion
3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.

Organization
4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

##### Technical Quality
Test-Driven Development
4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).

Code Quality
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

##### Product experience
User Experience
2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.

Performance
2: Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.

## Team

### Projects

The only team project this module is The Pivot, and I did not participate long enough to be graded, but before left, was working as my group's project manager.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Chelsea Johnson:
Chelsea is the perfect ally to have on a project. She architected the mission for the posse that we co-led this module and was always organized, on-time, and engaging. She has both the patience and direction to lead the junior students which the posse attracted, but also the technical chops to do whatever is required. I love seeing her projects because they're always fun, inspired, and technically challenging. This paragraph is shifting in and out of past and present tense because Chelsea is a bonafide developer for all ages. I enjoy being able to work with Chelsea and hope I get more chances in the future!

To Ling Tran:
Ling was a fun addition to our new posse this module and I enjoyed getting to work with her. Not only does she have a quick and creative mind, but she also engages those around her. She's an awesome teammate because of her positive mindset and the way she encourages and inspires those around her.

### Being a Community Member

From Chelsea Johnson:
I love my nerd sister! Not only is she an extremely talented developer, but she is also kind, caring, and optimistic. I have enjoyed being a posse leader with her and look forward to serving with her next module. When developing, she is not afraid of taking on challenges and seeks elegant solutions to her problems. Heidi is always thinking of others, and also takes time to volunteer for Kids Who Code and other Turing events. Heidi- you rock, and I am proud to call you my friend!
Chelsea Johnson

Ling Tran:
Heidi provided assistance a number of times when I was stuck on project issues (especially those pertaining to FactoryGirl!). She was very thoughtful with her questions to get on board and contextualize particular problems. And the best part is that we were always able to get to a solution! I got to know Heidi through participation in the Miyamoto Posse and Clarke Coin hackathon group. She is so knowledgeable and helpful, I don't know how I did not get to know Heidi until this module! Heidi is so strong I am not sure I can identify any areas for improvement. Perhaps adopt another cat if you are not already a cat guardian, Heidi!?


### Playing a Part

* Conducted a student-led elective teaching the principles of lockpicking and how it overlaps with infosec

* Co-organized my new posse with Chelsea Johnson. It is an interesting experience, choosing a theme and trying to keep the interest and engagement up. At times, especially during the Hackathon, it feels a little frustrating to be working on basic Ruby code with a lot of Mod 1 and Mod 2 students, instead of having some school-sanctioned time to work on projects I'm more interested in, but it also has been a good takeaway for me about the purpose of posses. One of the things I liked about the old posse model was that a successful posse pulls each student up, from senior to junior. There's no reason that structure can't exist in other posses, but I have appreciated my posse members' willingness to reach out to each other and keep in my mind that everyone was a beginner once.

* Working on a blog post providing illustrative examples and principles of good API documentation

* Participated in Productivity Lunch (taking notes and once leading discussion) and supporting my Environmental Variables buds

* I had to scale back helping with Kids Who Code, but I'm excited to pick it up again.

* Starting 2nd time of being a prework guide
