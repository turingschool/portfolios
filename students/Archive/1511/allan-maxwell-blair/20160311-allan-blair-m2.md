# Allan Maxwell Blair - M2 Portfolio

### Your Mission

Learn as much as possible during my time at Turing. Capitalize on the intellectual freedom that comes along with being a student. Pave the way for those who come after me and support those who came before.

### Goals

1. Gain an understanding of what is going on behind the scenes between a client and the server (Middleware, Server software, HTTP protocol)
2. Begin working on an open source project in Go
3. Be more social and go to more meet ups

### Results

1. Have experimented hosting my own website using a Raspberry Pi and hosting a chat application using a Digital Ocean droplet
2. Began working on Vici a A simple continuous integration server for multi-platform testing with Ben Johnson
3. Go meet up at SendGrid - 2/25/2016; Half an EMACs meet up at Turing - 3/3/2016

### End of Module Assessment

**Challenge: Mavis Bacon**

Assessed By: Andrew

Result: PASS

##### Notes:

* Testing got to a fairly robust level. I would have liked to see a scope of the assertion, but did not.
* Told developer to focus on defining everything needed before diving into the test so the whole test can drive implementation of the whole feature.
* Ruby was good, but not completely refactored. Was able to refactor collaboratively.
* Overall a good solid assessment and a pass

##### Scores:

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
3. Rails Syntax & API: 4
4. MVC & Rails Style: 4
5. Testing: 3
6. Collaboration: 4

### Mid Module Assessment

##### Scores:

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 4
* Testing: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Erinna Chen:** Erinna is one of the strongest if not the strongest member of 1511. Having observed her for the last few months Erinna has made strides to interact and relate with others at Turing. At times I forget she is an academic from the highest echelons of pedagogy. At other times I feel patronized or openly criticized for my thoughts and actions. Unfortunately this is reinforced with a general sense of competitiveness when collaborating with Erinna. I think the level of competitiveness when interacting with Erinna could be the root of the negativity.
>In the short term Erinna could work on her collaboration by muffling her competitive nature when on a team. In the long term Erinna could work towards not feeling the need to compete with team mates at all.


>**Kimiko Kano:** Kimi is one of my favorite people in the 1511 cohort. While my opinion doesn't mean much I think that my sentiments are $echo'd across the cohort. From a technical perspective both Kimi and I have backgrounds in engineering which has led to similar processes when approaching a problem. While this style of thinking is suited for algorithmic thinking, which I believe Kimi excels at, it is not well suited for innovative thinking. Kimi's methodical approach requires her to understand each component in isolation; this can become onerous when working with new technologies. One way she could improve is through diving into new or difficult projects with little heed for how they work. Getting Kimi out of her comfort zone could really take her to the next level.

>**Chad Ellison:** The Chad is a passionate student and loves to learn. He has clearly worked on his workflow and can proficiently navigate the terminal. Another strong characteristic of Chad is his communication skills. He can navigate conversations deftly and easily explain his ideas. Chad's love of learning can also make him difficult to work with. In pursuit of understanding Chad will at times slow down or even halt a workflow until he feels comfortable. In moderation this practice is beneficial for everyone to an extreme it can cripple a process. One way Chad could work better with a team is by aggregating his questions instead of several interruptions.

>**Adrienne Domingus:** Adrienne is the full package: strong organization, algorithmic thinking, and creativity. This was demonstrated by her leadership role in the Little Shop Project were we successfully completed base functionality several days ahead of schedule. Adrienne can continue to work on stepping out of the box. Given her high level of performance she can expertly stay with in the lines even if client requirements require her to jump through hoops. This may not always be the right answer and should be weighed with skepticism given she is the expert.

>**Chelsea Johnson:** Chelsea is a pleasure to work with and could easily integrate into any team. She has no problem pushing through her work at an efficient pace and is by all means a competent team member. Although, what really separates Chelsea from other developers is her ability to relate with everyone on a personal level. It is simple, everyone likes Chelsea.
>An area for improvement would be her creativity in problem solving. When approaching new challenges Chelsea seems to have a hard time finding her way. One way she can improve this is by forcing herself to take on new and uncomfortable challenges more regularly. This will give her the confidence that is needed to take on whatever in her way.

### Being a Community Member

>Allan is a strong programmer who shows passion for and dedication to learning as much as he can, above and beyond what is required of him. He shows creativity in the approach he takes to solving new problems, as well as a consistent ability to solve what comes his way.  Allan can continue to work on having more forgiveness/patience with team members when they make mistakes or don't understand something. -**Adrienne Domingus**

>I truly enjoyed working with Allan. His positivity and sense of humor contributed significantly to the dynamic of our group.  He demonstrates a solid understanding of Ruby and Rails and solved difficult problems with ease. He enjoys pushing the limits of his understanding and exploring new ideas (NPrrr and his side hustles). Occasionally his communication during collaborating was slightly lacking; however, his communication improved as the project progressed.-**Chelsea Johnson**

>Allan is a very strong programmer. He is very aware of what his code is doing, and he is a very efficient debugger. It was rare that we would spend more than 30 minutes troubleshooting a problem during our traffic spy project. I have no doubt that Allan will become a great developer; he works very hard and has strong technical abilities. I think Allan could benefit by continuing to develop his soft skills as he works with others, specifically by communicating how he intends to tackle a problem and his thought process along the way.-**Chad Ellison**

>Allan is clearly a driven person and learns quickly. He has very strong opinions and I respect that aspect of him. His assertiveness was a bit off-putting to me when working on the mini-project. I understood that his priorities lie with other projects, and that he wanted to set a boundary in order to work on those things. I just didn't feel like there was any room for negotiation and that may have come from my own desire to be accommodating. With that said, he is a solid-programmer and is a partner that you can count on to build a good-quality product.-**Erinna Chen**

>One of the things that I most admire about Allan is his ability to be so forthcoming about his feelings and opinions. He tends to have a more negative view of the world than I do, and at times I think he could lighten up and not take everything so seriously, but I think he's just more critical in coming up with ideas for how things could be improved than I am. I get a lot of benefit from discussions with Allan as he often opens my eyes to new ideas and he's great at giving constructive feedback for ways that I can continue to improve my coding abilities and just myself in general. Another thing that impresses me about Allan is that he has gone all in on learning Go in addition to everything we're learning about Ruby and Rails and I can't quite comprehend how he's able to do so much. There have also been many times when he's helped me to understand a difficult concept and he's done so without making me feel like an idiot for not getting it right away.-**Kimiko Kano**
