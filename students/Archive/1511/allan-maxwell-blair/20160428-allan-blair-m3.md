### End of Module Assessment

**Challenge: Consume Best Buy API and serve up Storedom**

Assessed By: Josh

Result: PASS

##### Notes:
- Produced API is solid. Why wrap request in "parameters"?
- Webmock blocking external HTTP requests because it's in the development block.
- Form is sending a POST request without access token. Not using Rails form helpers which would fix the problem.
- `get_products` in service needs refactoring.
- String interpolation in the view is a little weird: `"SKU: #{result.sku}"`
- Nice use of Product object and call out to the service.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Julian Feliciano:** Julian codes well. Julian could work on the way he delegates questions. Julian is the go to for questions on lavascript. In order to keep his work flow efficient he should try to point people to resources on the web or tell them off.

>**Kimiko Kano:** I trust Kimiko's code. If Kimi feels comfortable I feel comfortable. Kimiko can work on prioritization. Choosing between perfect code and getting full functionality is a constant balancing act. Currently she leans towards perfection. Stay balanced.

>**Nicholas Doran:** Nicholas typically knows how to get an app done. I would say that Nick has the tools to solve just about any problem that comes his way. He can work on forming his own opinions on code design and architecture. Without a solid set of rules and structure Nick can have a hard time being decisive. With a more rigid dogma on code design he can take his skills to the next level.

### Being a Community Member
>I worked with Allan for a week on the Pivot project. Early on, he acknowledged that the project was not in a great place when I joined the team and I appreciated that he told me so up front so that I could prepare myself for a long week ahead. Allan did a good job of keeping our team on track to finish the project since we had to get a lot done in a short amount of time and he was quick at helping me debug whenever I got stuck on something. When Allan is in a positive mindset he brings a lot of optimism and joy to others, so I would encourage him to try to maintain that optimism more often. I'm glad to have had the opportunity to work with Allan more closely this module. I'm constantly impressed by his intelligence, how quickly he's able to grasp new concepts, and how much he pushes himself above and beyond. -**Kimiko Kano**

>I’m gonna first say, I really like Allan a lot. We've gotten to know each other pretty well over the last 3 modules and I had the privilege of working with him for the pivot project this module. It was a great experience - Allan is a coding machine and a great person to work with.  When Josh told our group “ya know it would be cool if you could have a drone launch upon order completion - people have tried it before but no one could do it”, the look on Allan’s face was CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. So he went ahead a wrote a whole separate program, written in Go, that wrapped around another program written in Node.JS, which communicated with a drone and launched it off. It took him a few days, a lot of trial and error (thank god the drone didn’t break on us), but he got the job done! Our app was able to launch off a drone and it was freaking sweet! If I were to have one critique about Allan, it would be that he can be a bit abrasive and harsh at times, but that’s only because he’s brutally honest. I trust and respect his opinion on many things, and I really enjoy getting feedback from him. I may not always agree with him, but he’s usually right. Allan will go on to do great things in life, he’s got the drive and intelligence to do whatever he wants to. I wish him much success -**Nicholas Doran**
