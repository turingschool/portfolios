* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

**Parsing http requests and making responses** Required to build a functioning
web server capable of responding to path, verb, and parameters of http requests.

Assessed By: Horace

##### Notes:
* Got solid implementation through iteration 4; a few hiccups in using
the app but overall structure is pretty solid
* Code could be cleaned in several places on the method / line-of-code level;
could do some method extraction and especially some clearer and more
thorough naming of concepts and steps
* At a higher level I appreciate that the various classes have pretty clean
input/output interfaces and this makes it easy to follow the flow from
one object to another
* Top-level execution loop should probably go...somewhere - maybe into
server class or even into another new object that would handle some
of these jobs that span the entire "session"


##### Scores:

  * Overall Functionality: 3
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amaxwellblair/complete_me
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown

**Textual Auto Complete** Required to build a textual auto complete program based on
the principles of fast look up in tree like data structures.  Implements recursive
dictionary loading and searching.

Assessed By: Horace

##### Notes:

* Good job finishing all the base features and adding your own shoes app
* I appreciate your taking a stance on different algorithm approaches --
picking your own ways to figure out how build each piece
* Tests show strong progression from trivial cases to the more complex
* Using tests to verify the structure of the trie as we build it up
* Would think a little more about test naming -- try to name tests in a
way that really describes what you're doing
* Along the same lines, think about naming methods from the perspective of
the values that they produce rather than the means by which they produce them
* Don't forget to distill boolean if/else's into simple boolean expressions
* Some nice use of various enum methods to get jobs done (with index, map, etc)

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Fundamentals & Ruby Style: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Enumerables & Collections: 4

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amaxwellblair/module_1
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown

**Binary Search Tree** Required to build a binary search tree data structure.  
Tree class also implements functionality for sorting, identifying max and min,
and removal of nodes / tree repair.

Assessed By: Horace

##### Notes:

* Couple issues with relative vs. absolute paths; got them patched up pretty easily
* Volume of tests looks good at first glance - 60 tests
* Test suite shows good progression and gradual escalation of complexity;
using tests to verify initial structure of the tree and then diving into more complicated
behavior
* Added all 3 extensions - nice job
* Overall quite clean implementation
* Keep an eye on using boolean values to avoid unnecessary ternaries or if/else
* Keep an eye on method naming, especially in the case of boolean methods -
try reading it like a sentence and see if the naming makes sense
* Quite a strong project overall

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerables & Collections: 3


#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amaxwellblair/sorting_suite.git
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown

**Sorting Algorithm Implementations** Required to implement data sorting
algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.  This project included
extensions for benchmarking sorting algorithms, as well as algorithms for two
dimensional data sets.

Assessed By: Horace

##### Notes:

* Hit some neat extensions by including selection sort and quick sort
* Quick sort especially is a challenging algorithm so nice work on that
* Testing covers lots of cases; uses an interesting inheritance approach
to aggregate handling lots of the edge cases
* In some places we can find ways to achieve the same implementation in a
way that communicates the intent
* Tests are great as far as verifying the sorting capabilities; let's keep
looking at ways to add tests that really target the specific details of
each implementation

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectation: 4
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/amaxwellblair/module_1/tree/master/night_writer
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

**Text to Braille Conversion** Required to create a program which could
translate plaintext into braille characters and print them.  Project emphasized
file I/O and clear methods with one responsibility.  Extensions included
translating numbers use '#' signifiers and translating special common words.

Assessed By: Jeff

##### Notes:

* Built writer, reader, and numbers extension
* Writer/Reader works with caps, numbers, etc
* Spent about 20-22 hours
* About 6 tests that are high level but test a lot of functionality
* Prefer passing data in / getting data out rather than instance variables

##### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**July Tran:** "July is professional, intelligent and confident. Can easily step back and assess a situation then formulate a solution. Her light and airy demeanor allows for seamless collaboration. July should focus on turning her thought process into words. This will allow others to try and keep up with her quick wit and creativity."

>**Chelsea Johnson:** “Cheljo is resourceful and independent. She can solve most problems on her own with little need for outside input. Cheljo’s creativity in independence is equally valued in collaboration making her an ideal team member. Due to her ingenuity at times she will approach problems with a hammer instead of a precision tool. As she continues to learn more I wouldn’t be surprised if this feedback is negated completely."

>**Brennan Holtzclaw:** “The moment Brennan and I sat down together we were acting as if we had been pairing for years. Many would say that we just mesh. I would say nay. Due to Brennan’s high EQ he immediately adjusted to my wavelength allowing me to feel comfortable and secure in our partnership. Due to his laid-back nature and calm exterior it may be a surprise to some that Brennan is an active problem solver. Methodical in his thought process Brennan prefers to break down problems by hashing them out on paper and taking a look at the results. One way he could improve the speed of his feedback loop is to solve the simple parts of the equation mentally and use this as a base for his processes. Another worthy facet of Brennan’s kit is his love of Turing and the message he sends via his podcast. In retrospect Brennan was one of my first impressions of Turing. Since I am here you can assume it was a positive one!"

>**Julian Feliciano:** “Julian’s positivity and optimistic outlook is infectious. This combined with his discipline, drive and determination make Julian not only an ideal programmer but also an outstanding citizen. Julian has a habit of solving problems and calling his solution a ‘hack’. These solutions are typically quirky, creative and out of the box. I say keep hacking away Julian. An area of improvement for Julian is to balance his discipline with a bit of calculated risk. It’s clear his application design process works, but not every problem needs a forklift… sometimes a trolley works just fine!"

### Being a Community Member

>"Allan is a great partner to work with! We paired for most of our project and I greatly benefited from observing how he approaches figuring out unknowns. Allan was also very collaborative throughout the process, and did well in explaining his ideas. He has a tendency to move too quick at times, and may overlook some critical information in his haste. Allan's combination of skill, dedication, collaboration, communication, and fun, pleasant personality make him a great partner."-**July Tran**

>"I have really enjoyed getting to know Allan! His positivity and humor have really added to our experience as 1511 students. He is a natural leader and conveys his ideas clearly and succinctly. He is incredibly knowledgeable about programming and is very willing to help debug others' code. He has submitted multiple helpful resources to our cohort on Slack, many of which he authored. And have you seen his Github? It's great- he clearly has a passion for programming computer science."-**Chelsea Johnson**

 >“Working with Allan was an adventure every day. He’s an incredibly hard worker who’s always focused on the next goal and making himself and his work better. When we weren’t working on the final project he was working on some sort of a side project to sharpen his skills in Ruby, Go, or possibly origami (I don’t know - he was just ALWAYS working).
I tried to get him to slow down sometimes, focus on smaller goals, and go with the flow when we ran into problems in the spec and spec harness. He helped me take a new look at TDD, nesting enumerables, and pushing myself harder instead of just “getting through the module.”
Outside of work he’s a genuinely good guy to hang out with. I look forward to pairing with him in the future.-**Brennan Holtzclaw**

>"Allan is one of the smartest people I have been around in my life. What impresses me so much about Allan is that in lieu of this, he can outwork nearly anyone I have met. His constant need to push himself to write the best code he possibly can pushes me to work just as hard. Constantly curious and always willing to ask the questions that nobody else will, every module needs an Allan. Aside from his technical skills, Allan is just an enjoyable person to be around and discuss a whole range of topics. His passion towards the things he believes in helps remind myself to be passionate about my beliefs as well."-**Julian Feliciano**
