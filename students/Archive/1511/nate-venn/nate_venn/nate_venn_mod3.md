# Nate Venn - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission for module 3 was to start and finish a production app on my own that
consumes an api. I also wanted to improve my ability to read and understand
documentation and then effectively implement those tools. And as a bonus, learn
some JavaScript.


### End of Module Assessment

**Assessor:** Nate Allen

Notes:
- Not customizing JSON response
- Great MVC and service split
- Great tests
- Concerned about your ability to construct an internal API. Didn't get very far in the test.

###  Ruby Style
* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

###  Rails Syntax & API
* **4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

###  Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**

###  Progression/Completion
* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

###  Workflow
* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

### Team Project

#### (The Pivot)

* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The pivot was our first project in module 3. We inherited a exisiting code base,
an app that was designed for a coffee shop and turned it into a Air B&B like app.

**Assessor:** Josh Mejia

Notes:
- Really solid UI/UX.
- Added Google maps, a slider for selecting prices, nice use of calendars and dates.
- Solid code quality and good use of POROs. Resorted to Ruby when ActiveRecord could have been used but overall really good code quality.

##Feature Delivery

#### Completion

* **4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**

#### Organization

* **4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.**

#### Git Workflow

* **4: Team always pull requests to introduce code to their project in a professional manner. Most commits are squashed.**

## Technical Quality

#### Test-Driven Development

* **3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).**

#### Code Quality

* **3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

## Product Experience

#### User Experience

* **4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.**

## Risk taking and creativity

#### Extensions

* **4: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.**

Adam Hundley's feedback :

"Nate is a developer. There is no doubt about that. He is a Vim master and a true leader in all senses of programming.
The pivot was a stressful and time consuming project, but Nate was able to take on anything that was thrown his way and conquer
rssues with ease. He has become one of my go to classmates when it comes to questions and help. Nate is not only turning into a
great developer but a great friend."


### Individual Projects

#### ApiCurious

[GitHub Url] (https://github.com/natevenn/gitmenow)
[Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub Url] (https://github.com/natevenn/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In this project, I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes data from the turing SalesEngine data schema.

**Assessor:** Josh Mejia

Notes

Really solid use of AR. Testing was low and merchants BI was mostly untested. One scenario where formatting in the model.
Controllers were really clean.

Feature Delivery

#### Completion

* **3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.**

Technical Quality

#### Test-Driven Development

* **2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.**

#### Code Quality

* **4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.**

#### API Design

* **3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.**

#### Queries

* **4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.**

### Playing a Part

I Have supported the larger Turing Community?

* Joined lunch roulette groups
* Part of the community fitness
* volunteers to bring in the recycling every wednesday

### Posse take away

I got to pair with Adrienne, Adam, David, and Brian on adding an Api endpoint to
Exercism.io, so we can display each posse memeber's total
number of completed exercises in each language on our Brin Posse App. The big take away is the
experience of working in a large existing codebase and walking through the
process of a good github work flow with code reviews.
