## Nate Venn - M1 Portfolio

## Your Mission

My mission is to do my best and to get the most out of the program.

My goal for this module was to learn as much of the fundamentals to programming and to have an understanding of the ruby language that allows me to write my own programs that I can experiment and practice with. I also wanted to improve my typing skills as well as develop a faster work flow on the computer. As I reflect on the past six weeks at Turing I am shocked at how far I have come and what I have accomplished.

 **Assessed By:** Tess

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities)

### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/natevenn/linked_list_project.git)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beat uses a Linked List to create a drum machine that a user can interact and play with.

**Assessed By:** Mike ​Dao ​

* Good testing, covered a good number of cases, 20 total tests.
* Functional linked list which implemented find, insert, pop, append, also calculated count and not stored it.
* Did not have the functionality of speaking beats, but the list was built and built well. ​

#### Functional Expectations
​* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
​
#### Test-Driven Development ​
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data ​
#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components ​
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
​
#### Fundamental Ruby & Style ​ ​
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring ​

#### Looping or Recursion ​
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

To July Tran - "I had the opportunity to work with July on our Black Thursday project and I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. July shows reliability, good communication, great organization, and demonstrates  competence in programing and logic. We quickly and organically fell into a good rhythm for pairing, and I look forward to having the opportunity to work with her again."

To Adrienne Domingus - "Adrienne might be one of the most talented programmers in our cohort. I got to experience her strong technical skill set while pairing with her on HTTP Yeah you know me. She is able to quickly grasp concepts and almost immediately implement solutions. Like most of us she lacks confidence in her abilities and can try to let go of her anxieties. Adrienne was a pleasure to work with and I look forward to working with her again."

July Tran - "Nate is a wonderful partner to work with! He is great at communication and brings a calming energy to the team. I also appreciate his easygoingness and supportiveness. Nate is competent in his skills and is a very dependable partner."

adrienne Domingus - "Pairing with Nate on HTTP Yeah You Know Me was a very positive experience. He has a great attitude and remains calm under pressure. He asks good questions and took extra time outside of our pairing sessions to go back and understand things he didn't initially, and wrote most of our test suite! If there is one thing he could work on, it would be to have more confidence in his abilities - he knows more than he thinks.""


Erinna Chen - "I have paired with Nate throughout the module and he has made strong progress from where he started. I have a ton of respect for his positive attitude even when constantly faced with the struggle of learning new things. Other than working through more code, I think Nate would benefit from spending time getting familiar with his programming environment and developing his typing ability."

Black Thursady

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/julyytran/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/julyytran/black_thursday/blob/master/README.md)

Data Analysis program utilizing buisness data

The project focused on creating relationships between datasets. It utilized CSV parsing, data access layering, and buisness intelligents. The relationships between the merchant, their items, invoices, and transactions allows in-deth analysis and data mining.

# July & Nate

**Instructor:** Horace


## Notes

* 125 tests
* sweet bash snippet to run tests
* completed I0 - I4
* overall structure is good; got good relationships; using repos to find appropriate data where needed
* generally could be more consistent about leveraging the relationships we have already constructed;
frequently we end up re-constructing a relationship from a different method
* handful of ruby style nitpicks here and there -- unnecessary local variable creation and
unnecessary explicit boolean values
* analysis is pretty successful at leveraging existing relationships and record-level methods; keep
pushing on these fronts to get as much logic as we can down into the record / model layer
* most analysis methods are pretty clean and concise; don't be afraid to extract more helper
methods when these start to get longer

## Evaluation Rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Http Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/adriennedomingus/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Parsing http GET/POST requests and making responses Required to build a functioning web server capable of responding to path, verb, and parameters of http requests. The project implemented several features: word-search within a loaded dictionary, a number guessing game that tells the user to guess lower or higher, and several data return functions including date/time, counter, and stack trace.

(evaluation comments)

#### Overall Functionality

Score: 3

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

Score: 3

Use require ;)
Rename your things (earlier). It's not that hard, and the amount of mental overhead it will save you will make up for the mental overhead you put in to do the change.

##### Test-Driven-Development

Score: 3

One test is actually wrong (tests are currently failing :()
No test on shutdown
Many tests are unit tests (can be run without making web requests)
Choose test names that describe the thing you're testing. Eg you have:

Game
  number to guess
  guess that is too low
  guess that is too high
  correct guess
  guess counter
But those describe the tests. You want to describe the game:

Game
  tells you when the guess is too high
  tells you when the guess is too low
  tells you when the guess is correct
  counts how many guesses before you found the correct number
Specify only as much as you care about (you know how much you care about by reading the name of your test)

def test_client_returns_body
  client = Hurley::Client.new "http://127.0.0.1:9292"
  response = client.get("http://127.0.0.1:9292")
  assert response.body.include? "html"
end

#### Breaking Logic into Components

Score: 3

Path is a great name, but it does more than just path things (it does "this is what I do at that path" things)
Decouple body generation from request counting (notice... this is the one that failed ;)
The decision of where to combine the command-line output with the server stuff is absolutely correct!
Wiring at the highest level (run!) should be visible.
