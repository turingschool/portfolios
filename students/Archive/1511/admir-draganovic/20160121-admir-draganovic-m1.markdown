## Individual

### Your Mission

My goal for this module was gain a solid understanding of ruby. I feel like I accomplished parts of that goal. I have improved from last module but I would like to be ahead of where I currently am as a dev student. I would also like to get more involved in community activities beyond helping individuals with specific issues. My attempt to build a relationship with Refugees on Rails is not fleshing out as quickly as I would like it to and I am beginning to realize I may have been a little too ambitious with the project.

Entering module 2 I want to take a different more focused approach. I know the resources that are available to me and I need to do a better job at holding myself accountable for utilizing them. Lovisa has offered to pair with me every weekday of the module break and I need to use this as an opportunity to not only catch up to some of my peers but potentially push ahead. Module 2 will be a big challenge for me and I feel like going through it will definitively answer the question of me having what it takes to be a developer.

### Goals

  * 1: I want to come out of Mod 2 well rounded (Using API's, Debugging, Get good at front-end, Rails)
  * 2: I would like to finish Mod 2 with a good idea of what I would like to do as a developer.
  * 3: I would like to work on a initiative to assist refugees. (Refugees on rails, Piggy back onto Turing projects)

### End of Module Assessment

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Below is feedback I have given to some peers.

Nick Weiland - Pairing with Nick for Black-Thursday was a very positive experience. Nick's attention to detail and his drive to test every portion of the code allowed us to quickly navigate around obstacles we encountered. Aside from Nick being a highly skilled dev student he is also a great person. Nick took the time to explain concepts that I was having trouble understanding and also made time to help me talk through some personal issues I was experiencing. Due to his commission and technical skill Nick would be a key member to any dev team he joins after Turing.

Alireza Andersen - Being paired with Ali for HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me was one of the more enjoyable partnerships I have had while at Turing. I admired Ali’s drive and determination thought out the project. He was very methodical about every step of the project. Ali’s strong suit is his problem solving logic. His excitement about the project caused us to stay and refactor late into the night. We turned in a very successful project mainly due to his attention to detail and work ethic.

### Being a Community Member

Below is feedback I have received from peers.

Scott Firestone - It was a pleasure getting to know Admir during Module 1. Before the first day of class, we met at a student-led prep session for Module 1. He was friendly and welcoming, which instantly alleviated my anxiety jumping into the new environment. During the holiday intermission, we met several times to pair on Ruby exercisms. While solutions may not have come instantly, he constantly provided good ideas on solving the problems while effectively using pry and testing. As a budding developer, Admir possesses all the necessary attributes for success.

Brennan Holzclaw - Admir and I knew this second time through Mod 1 was going to be a struggle, but we teamed up whenever possible to try and keep pushing and not let ourselves get complacent in the work. He was always a source of new insights, and new tips and tricks to improve my flow, and he did a great job of always looking ahead. I think he’s overcome some huge hurdles this module, and I believe he’ll do well from here on out.

### Playing a Part

I participated in the Turing community in the following ways:

* Dan Winter and I have had several meetings with a Refugees on Rails founder and are trying to find a good way to build a relationship with the organization that       would benefit students at Turing and refugees learning to program.
* I made myself available to my peers.
* I supported community members by attending both of Turings LGBT events.
* I try to do one small thing a day that benefits someone else at Turing.
