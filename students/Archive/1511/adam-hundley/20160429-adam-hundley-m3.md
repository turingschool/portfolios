# Adam Hundley - M3 Portfolio

### Mission:
My mission in MOD 3 has been to further my knowledge and abilities in the Ruby on Rails Stack. Additionally I have strived to push myself in the learning of JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery. Throughout each project I have tried to implement more and more of these new technologies and believe I have been quite successful at it.

### Goals:
* Constant UX improvement
* Begin developing JS, AJAX & jQuery
* Define myself as a leader in the module
* Blog more
* Attend more meetups
* Begin thinking about jobs

Spotishow is a Full Stack Ruby on Rails application that scans your Spotify account and populates a list of shows based on your location and most listened to artists. You have the ability to remove and add artists to your Spotishow account, which then updates your list of shows. You can also update your location which affects your show list.

Crash At My Pad (CAMP) is an eCommerce Rails application that was built upon Little Owl. The main goal for this project was to learn how to "pivot" an existing business model into something completely different to reflect an agile approach of a real world scenario.

Technologies: Rails, Ruby, Ajax, JavaScript, jQuery, Spotify API, Bandintown API

### Feedback to Me

I strive to give feedback in the moment with my classmates. Below is some feedback that has been recorded.

### Being a Community Member

  From Nate Venn  
> "It really meant a lot to me to receive awesome feedback from Adam because I really lookup to him as a developer and friend.  Adam really led the charge in the pivot. He worked just as hard as the rest of us but twice as fast. His ability to design and implement a professional UX and tackle some of the most complicated problems in the project proved to me that he is a great developer and someone that I would want on my team."

  From Alex Navarrete
> "I’ve never really worked with Adam until it came time for us to do team during The Pivot. We really pushed ourselves to make ends meet even when testing was a pain. I’m glad we got the time to pair up and make the Airbnb mock up a reality. It’s so cool to see how he’s become better at programming since I can recall the day we were sitting next to each other and he came up to a solution for something I was struggling on in Engima. I have faith that he will move on and become even better at programming and making any personal project idea into a reality."

  From David Whitaker
> "Adam is a really talented developer with a strong drive.  I really admire his work ethic and fearlessness in tackling new challenges.  We spend a lot of time working with one another and I always appreciate his opinion and get a ton of benefit from bouncing ideas off of him.  I also look forward to staying friends after turing and hope that we can continue to push each other as programmers too.  I think that sky’s the limit for his abilities and I look forward to seeing what the future holds."

  From Nick Weiland
> “Adam has impressed me with his growth as a programmer.  His leadership in the implementation of the AirBnB clone for The Pivot led to an impressive app that showed huge growth in both front-end dev and a willingness to push the expectations of a project. Also, his grit in completing the Rails Engine queries without using Ruby was awesome to see. I think his firm grasp of programming fundamentals, coupled with his people skills, will quickly make him a strong team member on a dev team."

### Giving Feedback

  For Nate Venn
> "Nate is a developer. There is no doubt about that. He is a Vim master and a true leader in all senses of programming. The pivot was a stressful and time consuming project, but Nate was able to take on anything that was thrown his way and conquer issues with ease. He has become one of my go to classmates when it comes to questions and help. Nate is not only turning into a great developer but a great friend."

  For Alex Navarrete
> "Alex is such a breath of fresh air when it comes to Turing. His outlook on life and desire to learn EVERYTHING is contagious. He pushed himself in the tasks he took on with The Pivot and was successful in all of his attempts. He is turning into a great developer and I can't wait to see what he does in the future."

  For David Whitaker
> "David is one of my go to guys. Whenever I have a question, problem or need an opinion, David is there to lend a hand. He is turing into a great developer. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."

  For Nick Weiland
> "Nick is my go to guy. Any question or problem is never to big for Nick to solve. He is a leader in our module and pushes all of us to do better. The talent Nick shows in programming is unmatched. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."

### Mentor Sessions
* My mentor sessions this module were with a friend that works as a developer at RTD, Steve Szczecina. We met on 3/22, 3/29, 4/12, 4/19 and 4/26.

### Playing a Part

* Participate in a student panel for prospective students in which I answered questions and discussed my experiences at Turing.
* Hackathon: For the Hackathon, myself and a few other students created an API endpoint for [exercism.io](www.exercism.io) that we successfully merged and is now used for the Brin Posse
* Brin Posse: I helped launch the [Brin Posse](https://brin.herokuapp.com) with Nick Weiland and completed 9 exercisms while pairing with other posse-mates.
* 1605 Prework: I was readily available for my assigned incoming student and following his progress.
* Student Lead Session: I facilitated a student lead session in which we attempted to complete a timed code challenge, mimicking what we will see in technical interviews.
* Turing Alma Mater: I wrote the [Turing Alma Mater](https://vimeo.com/158586392) last module ;)
