# Adam Hundley - M4 Portfolio

### Mission:

My mission in module 4 was simply to soak in as much knowledge as I could and take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. Never again will I be in a position to do nothing but learn. To learn whatever I want! Granted I will learn in a job, but it's not the same. These past 6 weeks I feel I have grown astronomically as a developer and I truly feel prepared(and a little scared) to enter the workforce. What a ride it has been!

### Goals:
* Constant UX improvement
* Become a JS master and work on all things ES6
* Blog more
* Attend more meetups
* Start the job search
* Continue building mentor relationship

### Individual Assessment
* __End of Module Assessment__ n/a
* __Individual Work and Projects__ 4
* __Group work and Projects__ 4
* __Community Participation__ 3
* __Peer & Instructor Feedback__ 3


### Individual Work

#### Revenge of Ideabox

* [Code](https://github.com/adamhundley/revenge_of_idea_box)
* [Production](https://idea-lightbulb.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1511/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0)

This is a Rails, single-page application. It uses JavaScript and jQuery to set up CRUD functionality for creating and storing ideas. The app relies on jQuery's AJAX methods to make calls internal API endpoints to get, store, update, and delete data. This project stretched my knowledge and use of all client side code and pushed me to get away from the comfort of constant page refreshes.

 __Score:__ 145/150

#### Thoughtbox

* [Code](https://github.com/adamhundley/thoughtbox)
* [Production](https://boiling-plains-90119.herokuapp.com)

#### Scaleup

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamhundley/block_party)
* [Production](https://blocparty.io)
* [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@adamhundley/why-cant-all-mobile-browsers-play-nicely-15d8d0a7ec84)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

For scale up I choose the Independent Study route. I took my game time project and made it fully mobile compatible. I learned about differences in mobile browsers, event listeners specific to mobile devices and implementing multiple React components. I also was able to use Firebase to have a top 5 global scoreboard in which a user can input their name when they set a new top score. I believe becoming familiar with stand-ups and 2 weeks sprints will prepare me for the workforce just as more as the code I wrote.

### Team Work
#### Game Time - (Nick Weiland)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamhundley/block_party)
* [Production](https://blocparty.io)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Bloc Party was made for the game time Assignment. We decided to take a different route than most teams and invent our own game. Our game was full screen unlike any other teams and also was deployed to a custom url.

Technologies: ES6, React, HTML5 canvas

### End of Module Assessment

I didn't have to take the end of module assessment due to already having enough points to graduate :)

### Attendance
I missed a half day 6/2 & a full day 6/3 for a wedding in Austin, TX.

### Feedback to Me

I strive to give feedback in the moment with my classmates. Below is some feedback that has been recorded.

### Being a Community Member

  From Scott Firestone  
> "Adam’s an awesome guy and super-conscientious student. He always seems engrossed in whatever he’s working on at school. He once helped me debug tests for my mod 3 personal project and was incredibly helpful, thoroughly explaining the issues along the way. It’s unfortunate I didn’t get to work with Adam on any projects during my time at Turing."

  From Adrienne Domingus
> "Working with Adam throughout our time at Turing has been a highlight of pairing experiences, both through assigned projects and mutual work on open source. He thinks quickly on his feet whether working on something we've been taught or something entirely new, and is committed not just to getting things done, but to getting things done the right way. His dedication both do honing his craft and becoming an awesome developer and to building the community is a powerful combination, and I know it will take him far. It's been a fun ride!"

  From David Whitaker
> "Adam is a really talented developer with a strong drive.  I really admire his work ethic and fearlessness in tackling new challenges.  We spend a lot of time working with one another and I always appreciate his opinion and get a ton of benefit from bouncing ideas off of him.  I also look forward to staying friends after turing and hope that we can continue to push each other as programmers too.  I think that sky’s the limit for his abilities and I look forward to seeing what the future holds."

  From Nick Weiland
> “Adam has impressed me with his growth as a programmer.  His leadership in the implementation of the AirBnB clone for The Pivot led to an impressive app that showed huge growth in both front-end dev and a willingness to push the expectations of a project. I think his firm grasp of programming fundamentals, coupled with his people skills, will quickly make him a strong team member on a dev team."

### Giving Feedback

  For Scott Firestone
> "Scott is a great developer. There is no doubt about that. I never directly worked with him on a project but felt like he was resource over the past 2 modules as we used the Spotify API. We both had the ability to share in victories and defeats over what turned out to be not that bad of an API. Scott is talented at programming, but more importantly he's a good person. He has an ability to laugh off jokes (which come at his expense a lot) while still get the whole room to laugh with him. He is has been a vital asset to the 1511 cohort and I look forward to seeing what he does in the tech world."

  For Adrienne Domingus
> "Adrienne could be one of greatest assets that our module has coming out of Turing. I say that because all of us will be able to say we knew her way back when, as she will probably be in a C level position in the next 10 years. Not only is her programming ability second to none, but her drive and leadership is impeccable. She is destined for greatness. Working with Adrienne on classwork and specifically endpoints for Exercism.io is always a learning experience for me. I always come away from the interactions with a piece of knowledge that I didn’t have before. I’m excited to see how she will become a female force to be reckoned with in the tech world and hope to stay in touch with her after Turing."

  For David Whitaker
> "David is one of my go to guys. Whenever I have a question, problem or need an opinion, David is there to lend a hand. He is turing into a great developer. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."

  For Nick Weiland
> "Nick is my go to guy. Any question or problem is never to big for Nick to solve. He is a leader in our module and pushes all of us to do better. The talent Nick shows in programming is unmatched. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."

### Mentor Sessions
* My mentor sessions this module were with a friend that works as a developer at RTD, Steve Szczecina. We met on 5/10, 5/17, 5/24, 5/31 and 6/7.

### Playing a Part

* Open Source Contribution - Myself, Adrienne and Nick spent a Friday afternoon creating another endpoint for [exercism.io](www.exercism.io) that was successfully merged and is now used for the Brin Posse
* Denver.rb - I spoke on debugging and the power of pry for the beginners track of the meetup.
* Turing Alma Mater: I wrote and performed the [Turing Alma Mater](https://vimeo.com/158586392) during a Friday lightening talk round.
* I facilitated a group for gear up one Friday
* Always available for lower module students to answer questions and help. I specifically helped Ling multiple times.

### Notes:

Focused on school this module - only recently started the job search - enjoyed the experience of his job these 7 months being learning.
Enjoyed going to and speaking at denver.rb knowing that he was about to graduate.
Mentor a friend outside of the program. Now starting to teach him a few things, and wants to stay involved in a mentoring relationship.
