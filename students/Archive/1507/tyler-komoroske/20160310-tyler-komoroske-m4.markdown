# Tyler Komoroske - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to become a well rounded developer that can go out and contribute value to an engineering team. I was really excited about learning JavaScript and I feel like I have the tools necessary to go out and find a job that uses both JavaScript and Ruby in their stack.

"Good work!" - Lovisa (Seriously, look at our check in form)

This was by far my favorite project at Turing. Once I was able to understand a Linked List in module 1, it became my favorite thing to do. So then I had a chance to make a linked list in JavaScript and actually visualize it in the form of Rake on a Plane?????? SIGN ME UP!!!!!!
This was an awesome project and I felt like I was really able to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.

Score: 108/200 points

Evaluated by: Jorge Tellez

Good use of abstraction and refactoring. Votes are not displayed on admin view. There are no tests. Good use of objects to isolate logic. Use of handlebars in templates was good. Separation between sockets for admin and user was really good.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Jill Donahue:

Jill was an awesome teammate during our Gametime project. She consistently showed motivation and desire to turn in a final project that exceeded expectations. She was always willing to work as hard as needed to make sure that we turned in a great project, even if it meant putting in extra hours. She has a knack for front-end design and was the driving force behind the UX in our project. Overall, Jill is an excellent teammate who always pays attention to the smallest details. Working with her in the future would be a pleasure!

### Being a Community Member
From: Marlo Major

Tyler and I were partners together on a project known as Bartleby where we were supposed to build a Notes application in Electron and Ember. By this time in the module, JavaScript was already so over my head that I had no idea where to begin let alone produce something of quality. However, throughout my complaining and constantly trying to figure out a way to get help from others concerning how to “do the thing”, the one phrase Tyler would repeat to me consistently, and he still repeats it on occasion, is “even though we may not know how to build this project completely, why don’t we just focus on one part at a time and learn some shit?”…and so we did. Tyler was always willing to build a new project in Ruby, a new game in JS, or willing to teach his roommate that is joining 1603, how to build a linked list, his favorite algorithmic exercise. Since starting module one, his approach to coding, Turing, and helping others has changed dramatically for the positive and I’m honestly pretty proud of how far he’s come. Tyler has matured overall as a developer probably more than anyone else in my class. Now that he is graduating, I’m very excited to see what comes from this newfound joy in programming an helping other individuals succeed. Though our Bartleby notes project turned out to be garbage, I can honestly say that the majority of our progress on the application came from Tyler just trying to “learn some shit". This was the most difficult module for me and had I not been paired with him on this project, I’m not sure how far I would have gotten. I’m forever grateful to have had him as a teammate. I’d do it again with no hesitation whatsoever.

From Jill Donahue:

Tyler is not only a dark horse talent in programming, but a really fun teammate to have around when everything starts breaking.  He remained adamant about taking a more difficult, albeit stronger approach to the dreaded appending nodes to the snake which produced a better project in the end.  He is a FORCE when it comes to debugging and remained stubborn in the best way possible to fix a problem.  I can’t wait to see where he ends up and I would absolutely work with him in the future. Cheers Tyler!

From Admir:
After struggling through my mid Module Assessment Tyler volunteered to pair with me. I was struggling with navigating through rails and reading errors properly. Tyler guided me through the application and also pointed me in the direction of some resources I could us to improve on my own. I am also appreciative of the fact that Tyler has been available for quick questions on slack.

### Playing a Part

During week 1, I stayed after for 2 hours with module 1 students and went over the concepts of a linked list. During this session, we set up both the node and the list classes. I also guided them towards creating a tail method as their first step, so that they could then append with confidence. I think I was able to lessen the abstraction of a linked list during this session.


When it was Module 4's cleaning day, I was truly a force to be reckoned with.
Germs on tables and door handles had ZERO chance of survival.

### Posse challenge

To be completely honest, I did not contribute anything to my posse. Throughout the first 4 modules at Turing, my posse NEVER met. Because of this, I never really understood the value of going to a posse challenge 30 minutes before class when I could get an extra 30 minutes of much needed sleep. Not exactly proud of this, but its the truth :(
