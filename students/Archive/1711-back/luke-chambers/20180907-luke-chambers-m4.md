# Luke Chambers - M4 Portfolio

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to focus on front end and was able to do so in my capstone. I wanted to be able to build a single page site using jQuery. I was able to accomplish both of these things.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Promises. I had a hard time understanding how to return nested promises.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I loved the fact that I was completely clueless. I used the opportunity to take the challenge home and learn more about how promises work. I feel much more comfortable today then I did during the challenge

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I used a lot of pryjs and a lot of trial and error to figure out how to make it work. I researched online as well.

* What did you learn?

I learned about Promise.all([promise]) and different ways to ensure synchronous code in an asynchronous environment.

Fail

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest challenge?

I enjoyed the opportunity to interview again as there is always things I could get better at. The whiteboarding was challenging as to how I approached it and I feel like I could've done it better.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked the fact that it forced you to not think in code but in the idea of code.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I asked some questions and tried to wrap my head around the design of the vending machine.

* What did you learn?

I learned I need to get better at communicating what my thought process is.

Pass

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

It wasn't really challenging.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

It was just doing APIs in different languages. There wasn't really anything to learn, just looking at docs.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I disliked focusing on the APIs vs doing the front end side of things.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Node.JS, Elixir, Phoenix.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I would change the entire curriculum to go back to front end so that we can actually get experience in building it out and develop empathy for front end developers

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

We didn't.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The biggest technical challenge was learning how to do the animations in jQuery and CSS. Those took me quite a while to get right especially because I had a false paradigm that there was little to no logic included in the front end. I was able to discover that it is quite an act to ensure that everything acts as one would expect it to act.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I spent time with front end mod4 and learned as much as I could. Some of the most learning that occurred in this module was in that classroom. When I didn't have that opportunity, I would look at the jQuery docs and play around to see what would work and what wouldn't.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Learning some front end basic technologies allowed me to empathize with the front end more then I even knew I wasn't. I held some assumptions about front end that was challenged by actually working on that side of things. First and foremost, I assumed that I would be able to just ask front end what they needed for a specific endpoint and it would be easy for them to answer what it is. I found that it wasn't very true at all.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

jQuery, Ember, CSS

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

Faker

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

It wasn't really challenging. It makes me want to contribute more to open source files.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I am going to contribute to more open source when I get out of Turing

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It wasn't challenging. I felt like the only project that I was able to really learn was capstone.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

N/A

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

During one of my interviews, I was told that I should list some of my passions on my resume. I have put those on my resume because I feel it will lead to positions that I actually want to have vs just having a job.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I enjoyed the process of planning a gear up. I was able to learn more about self doubt then I knew already, and I was able to share that knowledge in the best way we knew how to people who had been struggling with it. The best part for me was when someone responded extremely positively to Ricardo's script. That person had been struggling with self doubt and something that Ricardo said hit them pretty deeply.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I led the machine learning posse and participated in representing Turing at GoCodeCO. It is good to pass forward what was passed to you. When I was in mod2, Liam led the machine learning posse that really got me interested in it being something I can actually do and I wanted to share that passion with someone else for them to take up the mantle after I am gone.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Empathy, focus on diversity, and Ruby on Rails.

## Professional Development

* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
