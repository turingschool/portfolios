## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* My goals coming into this module were very community based. I wanted to join more groups, specifically related to gender and racial disparagement in tech and machine learning. I also wanted to be able to comfortably code in Rails and Sinatra. I was able to accomplish both of these goals to certain degrees. I went to several meetups addressing gender discrimination and am planning on going to a meetup called "Unlearning Racism" to start addressing my understanding of racial discrimination in tech. I feel comfortable coding in Rails, but I still feel less comfortable with Sinatra. I am currently working on a personal project in Rails (attempting to track refugee families for reunification) and a personal project in Sinatra (building a housewarming registration website).

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* The #join method in ActiveRecord was a struggle for me to wrap my head around. I am attempting to use them as much as possible in my personal projects in order to get more comfortable in using them effectively.

This blog post is an evolving log of my attempt to create an extension for rspec called PotteRspec.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was Bike Share. I enjoyed the challenge of diving deep into ActiveRecord methods. It presented a huge challenge, and my team did really well at approaching our workflow. My least favorite project was Job Tracker. It was good Rails practice, but I had a harder time understanding why it would be useful to anyone other then someone learning Rails. I felt like there was much more I could've done with it if I had been able to grasp that concept.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned I much rather prefer to work in paired projects. I enjoy the ability to bounce ideas off of people, and the independent projects are different enough that I had to explain my entire process before bouncing an idea off of someone. It helped to have someone with as much knowledge of the code as you do. I also learned how to estimate how long a project is going to take me. I feel comfortable in my personal workflow to give a rough time estimate of completion. If I am wrong, I am usually wrong by saying it will take more time then it takes me.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I enjoyed the paired projects in Mod2 quite a bit more then the paired projects in Mod1. In Mod1, there is a feeling that every piece of code that anyone writes has to be done with everyone present and everyone should touch every piece of code. In Mod2, we all felt more comfortable with using each other's methods to accomplish a goal without necessarily being part of that method's creation process. The trust in your teammates became implicit.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

I really enjoyed the Parable of the Polygon gear up, mostly because I wildly disagreed with the website that was presented. I feel like every conversation that I have around discrimination is designed around the lowest common denominator. The website was simply an extremely simplistic way forcing a person to a certain conclusion instead of treating the problem how complex it really is. Discrimination isn't a problem that can just be fixed by sliders (that is an exaggeration of my view of the simplicity of the program), it is a wicked problem that may never be solved. Humans instinctively reach for their "tribe" based off of our evolutionary past. It isn't about recognizing the problem anymore, we know it is there. It is about approaching a wicked problem with ideas that can mitigate it. Simplicity breed simplicity but not solutions. When the view of the problem is simple, it leads to discounting of the voices around you because the problem is so "simple" in your eyes. I would've liked to have a deeper dive that incorporated opposing solutions in order to breed growth. Also, if you put the slider to around 85% discriminatory, you achieved very little segregation.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was able to mentor a lot of the Mod1 students this mod. It was a service that was offered to us when we were in Mod1 and it was nice to be able to pay it forward. I also was able to get involved with the machine learning posse. We also created a channel for all of the 1711 cohort communicate between programs.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I want to be able to mentor Mod2 students and Mod1 students. I want to encourage more people to attend meetups that have to do with discrimination in tech. I also want to bring a guest speaker for the Friday 9AM speeches. I also want to talk to someone about the Turing interview process.
