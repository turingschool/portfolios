# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

**What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?**

Since M1 was my first foray into the world of coding, I hoped to build a strong foundation in Ruby, by understanding the basics of the language along with its associated syntax. I feel that I have come a long way in that regard. Barely 5 weeks ago, Ruby was an alien language to me and I now find myself able to create code in Ruby that follows convention and works.

**What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?**

I feel that I haven't reached the level that I had set for myself. Based on my final paired assessment, I struggle with abstraction and classes. It's been frustrating as I understand logic and how to break it down. I also found myself struggling while writing tests for the Black Thursday project - I was able to ultimately write the tests, but it wasn't an intuitive process for me and I feel I need to understand that process better. Finally I feel that I need to get better with time management and complete all the assigned reading and homework given to us. I learned that learning to code is not an easy process and requires one to put in a lot of effort. However, by putting in the time to practice and reading the class materials, I was able to gain an appreciable understanding of the language. I also learned how important it is to have good mentors and early on in the game. I waited a little too long to get going with mentors. Mod 1 has been very challenging for me - but has made me more determined to succeed and become the best developer I can be.

## Projects

**What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?**

My favorite project this module was night writer as it made me understand hashes and arrays. It was also gratifying to be able to create a tangible project that could have real world positive implications for the user. My least favorite project probably is Black Thursday - I feel I haven't grasped certain concepts like self. I understand what vertical traversing is and how it works (and why it's important), but still struggle with some of the concepts along with the testing required for those concepts.


**What did you learn from your independent projects?**

I learned that it was indeed possible for me to learn to code. Prior to coming into this program, I had some doubts whether I had the aptitude for programming. In all honesty, I did struggle a lot in the first few weeks (starting with the credit check exercise). However pairing with mentors really helped me understand logic and what I needed to do to complete the projects. I also realized the importance of pseudo-coding and now use that for all my projects.

**What did you learn from your paired projects?**

I understand and appreciate that different people bring different perspectives to the table. It was very interesting to see my partner's approach and thought process to addressing a logic component - i think i learned a lot from my pairings. Working in pairs is a compromise and one has to be able to come to an amicable resolution if there is conflict of ideologies. It also taught me to be mindful of each other's time and to work as a cohesive unit to complete the project. It was great to learn about and implement fixtures, mocks and stubs.

## Community

**What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?**

I really liked the Developer Identity session, where we were taught about branding ourselves and using social media to market ourselves. Too often we underestimate the importance of networking, which is one of the most important tools in procuring a job. I also liked the sessions with Jess (meditation etc.). My least favorite was probably 'Feedback' as I felt that people weren't being honest in giving feedback and embracing what was taught to us in class. I didn't feel that I gained a lot from that session (not becuase of the class material, but because the students were not being forthcoming in implementing the feedback).

**How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?**

I had the opportunity to be a member of the SAB this module. As a member of the SAB, I got the opportunity to represent my class during the SAB meetings and bring forth any issues that concerned my class members to the school's attention. Apart from being a member of the SAB, I took time to help a few other students with homework and class projects.

**What would you like to do to contribute next module?**

I would like to continue to help new students get comfortable with the Turing way of learning and help them succeed - pairing with some students that might some basic concepts cleared. Additionally, I would like to be involved in bringing in some guest speakers from the industry to give real world insights into work opportunities and expectations.
