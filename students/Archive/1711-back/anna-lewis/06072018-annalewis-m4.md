What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Managing stress and anxiety and improving communication.

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Struggle to manage work-life balance/how to be okay with less than perfect.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I think I was the only student in the class to explore a front-end framework in their capstone project.

How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I think it has been helpful to learn about the front-end aspect of development. It has also helped reinforce my desire to focus on backend development.

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Communication.
