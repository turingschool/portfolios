## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Coming into this module my priority was on learning javascript and front end DOM manipulation.  I think this goal has changed with more of a focus on learning another language/framework and expanding my knowledge of how a backend framework operates in terms of configuration and ORM's, with less of an emphasis on the front end aspect of web development.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Biggets technical challenge, which persists now, is how to organize code on the front end and what object oriented programming on the front end looks like in terms of classes, behavior, and state.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Learning about javascript and diving into the front end really opens up the possibilities for user experience and how a backend should be structured to reflect the UX.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I solved this challenge by relying on the OOP design principles learned in previous modules, and by building modular and what I believed to be reusable and easily maintable code.

* What did you learn?
I gained a lot of respect for the front end and its significance in shaping a functional and effective software product.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
One of the biggest challenges was forming opinions about frameworks and being able to express these fluently.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I really enjoyed practicing interviewing in a formal setting and being caught off guard by questions.  I think this was great practice for an interview scenario and being in that mindset.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
My challenge was to rely on discussions I have had with students and in class and realize that I do have opinions about certain approaches and I can express them effectively.

* What did you learn?
I learned about what an employer's mindset may be and how to handle myself in situations where I don't have an immediate clear answer.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Learning to deal with promises in JS, hands down.  I reached out to an upper mod front end student who showed me async, await, which I think should be taught in this module.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I reached out to front end students, which was extremely helpful.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked diving into an unopinionated framework, which I thinked help to deepend my understanding of rails.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, building a backend without an ORM.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I basically built a crude ORM with classes in JS and think it would have been interesting to do the backend with no resource models and just complex SQL queires using json agg.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
N/A

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
The biggest technical challenge for me was learning to configure flask, a lightweight python framework.  I enjoyed the experience but spent a lot of time wrestling with setup - thinks we haven't had to experience with rails.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I dug into resources on the internet and spent time to construct useful google searches.  There were a lot of resources available and this was a helpful appraoch.  I also looked back on our previous Sinatra projects to try and gain a better understanding of how to configure a lightweight framework.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed realizing that I could dive into something relatively unfamiliar and be successful - this is the biggest thing I will mention to employers.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
How to setup background tasks, how to utilize a message broker for this, and how to utilize dynos on heroku.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
CaravanTransit

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
The biggest technical challenge was understanding the backend schema and how all the resources were associated.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
The first thing we did was create a schema design and post this to the contributions page to help future contributors.  

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I really enjoyed seeing another person's perspective, from both how they associate models/tables to how they tested.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
how to use minitest with rails, has_and_belongs_to_many to setup many to many without joins table model, the process of submitting a proper open source PR in terms of formatting and documentation for review

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
During my mock interview I was asked questions that stumped me at the time, but which now I feel much better prepared for.  I was told to think back to all the discussions I've had in class or with other studetns and to not be afraid to share my thoughts on certain aspects of various frameworks.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
I did enjoy the experience.  It was challenging at first to get everyone on the same track and attempt to achieve a straight forward goal.  At first we had a lot of good ideas and no clear direction.   Towards the end we realized that it would leave things feeling unstructured and decided to narrow our focus which helped a lot in developing an effective lesson plan.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I helped lower mod students - which is certainly paying it forward as I have relied on upper mod and front end students.  This is a critical aspect of the Turing experience, that is mentorship, which I think will also transfer to the career realm.  The important element here is the incentive on the individuals to seek out mentorship and code reviews which are extremely helpful in shaping future decisions.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Mentorship - seeking out mentors and code reviews to improve while also putting myself in the position to be a mentor to more junior students / staff.  Being comfortable in an unfamiliar place - with this mod it was diving into python flask and django.  And the cool thing was I realized I could succeed and apply these same concepts I have learned in Rails.  After this experience I feel confident saying I can something even if at first it seems insurmountable.  Paired Programming / Team cooperation - I seek other people's perspectives on my codes and other's in their own code.  Working with others has helped me grow tremendously while at turing, both in forcing me to better explain my thoughts and opinions and in exposing me to new and different concepts.
