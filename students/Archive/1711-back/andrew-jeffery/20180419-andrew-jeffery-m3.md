## Areas of Emphasis

Initially I set out to learn about API's and how to build and consume them.  I also set out to begin networking within the programming community and start identifying areas within the industry I am most interested in.  I feel accomplished in regards to these general goals, although the latter is definitely a continual process that still requires much work.  As the module progressed I think my technical goals changed, and after feeling comfortable with api's, shifted focus to learning some javascript and application optimization techniques.  I think the personal project provided a great opportunity to explore these areas that we have scratched the surface on, and has provided a lot of exciting paths I look forward to exploring in the future.  I also set out to make myself available for lower mod students that have questions.  This included scheduling particular times with other students and generally being approachable.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

 **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
This project definitely felt very hard at first, but was great for learning how to structure consuming an api.  I really enjoyed the Friday session where we compared our structuring with other students and had a class-wide discussion.  I think this was the point where understanding consuming an api started to settle most for me.  I think an interesting addition to that lesson/discussion would be to have students to first write down there structure as they understand it and, before showing it to other students, have the student look at another students project and write down how they think that person structured their project, then they could compare.   

 **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
I really enjoyed being able to pursue a personal interest for this project.  I think I got caught in javascript world for a good portion of the project, which has opened my eyes to a more user centric approach to designing applications and the many possibilities available.  For this reason I did not give my back end design as much attention until late in the project, which made for a stressful experience.  Part of this was not thinking about optimizing application speed early in the project.  I liked having to provide a daily standup, this helped me track my own progress and plan for the future.  I think a longer, weekly formal checkin and quick mini-demo of sorts would have helped me prevent putting optimization of the back-end off for too long.  Lastly, I enjoyed using pivotal tracker and design the application and all tasks with the user in mind.

## B: Group Work & Projects

 **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
Great for learning how to build an api and dig into advanced active record queries.  The active record part definitely felt a little intimidating at first, and was something I struggled with in mod 2.  I felt like there weren't enough classes focusing on this in mod 2 and would have liked to seen it incorporated more.  That said, I really enjoyed the class on advanced queries and this helped tremendously with my understanding.  I think the instructors did a great job of helping us lay out a plan of attack for the project so we wouldn't get too hung up on one part before a crucial class.     

 **[Battleshift](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
Definitely slow going at first for this project.  This was somewhat difficult to adjust to for that reason, as with most other projects I like to front load and be able to spend the last day or so refactoring, adding additional features, and finishing off styling.  One of the biggest takeaways for me was really harnessing different testing approaches like mocks, stubs, spies, etc.  One of the things I wish I had done differently was start testing at the unit level.  Although I know this is more London style, I think for this particular project testing on the unit level really helped me adjust to the code base and understand the purpose of each class, whereas, beginning on the feature level required knowing a little about everything.  I really appreciated the 'warning' by the instructors during project kick-off regarding going down a messy path when dealing with a brownfield project.  There was definitely a point where my partner and I had made significant progress in the spec harness, but decided to restructure and take a few steps back to prevent more technical debt.  This was a defining moment in the project for me and I am glad we made that decision.

## C. **Gear Ups**

I really enjoyed the most recent mod 4 led gear up regarding finding common ground in a professional setting.  I think its good to be intentional with building relationships and think this session really drove that point home.  I also enjoyed questioning some of my perspectives after the groupthink session.  I think the session itself had some vague, general questions that left the class discussion wanting.  I think specific scenarios would have provided a better prompt for more insightful dialogue.  The micro-aggressions gear up helped me to think about what it means to be a considerate person.  

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

I gave a lightning talk this module about OOP vs. functional programming and have planned with a mentor to make an open source contribution to a ruby gem with their guidance.  The gem we have identified is whenever, which allows for a simple syntax to write and deploy cron jobs.  My mentor works mainly in python and does not know ruby so this is a cool opportunity to receive general directions and implement them technically.  My plan is to meet with them over break and discuss my progress.    


#### **Playing a Part**

As mentioned above I have worked with a number of lower module students, both in mod 1 and mod 2.  One of these students I mentored weekly, and others have just come by to ask for help.  I have tried as much as possible to be approachable and let students know I am available as previous upper module students have done for us.  I have also tried to share my networking connections with other students.  I have two friends that are developers, one of whom is actively seeking a junior developer, and have introduced them to other students in the module.  I connected them with Turing as well and have heard that they are meeting with a mod 4 front end student.  I plan to continue networking internally and externally and to participate in a posse more next mod as I did not this mod.
