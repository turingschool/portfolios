# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
* What's the next inning?

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Passed?

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  * I had very little experience in JS.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  * The thing I liked most about the challenge was that it was new and I as opposed to ruby, javascript was unique and novel to me. I needed to think on my feet and consider what could be done in the language.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  * I relied on the docs and google to give me some quick fixes for the problems I ran into, which were as simple as iterating over arrays and objects.
* What did you learn?
  * The biggest thing I learned was that if I am able to create isomorphisms between different languages, discern the patterns that are common, then I can develop a general understanding of the new language.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
Sorta Passed

* What was your biggest challenge?
  * The biggest challenge was the white boarding exercise. I felt I lost my sight of the original goal, and ended up going down some rabbit holes. I thought too big picture, and not granular.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  * Truthfully, I don't like these challenges, which is not say they are not useful. Far from it. If anything the feedback was the most useful and 'enjoyable' part.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  * I did not solve this challenge. I ended up getting lost in my own thought processes.
* What did you learn?
  * My weaknesses in technical communication were only solidified. It showed me that I need to work on general technical communication / terms more.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  * Working in Java was a whole new ball game. Even though it was OO language, there were multiple dependencies and quirks that I had not expected. The moment I was able to finally get a grip of what was happening, was about a week into the project after scouring the documentation and source code for modules, annotations, and libraries required.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  * I spent hours reading documentation. There was no other approach.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  * The fact that it was a challenge, and it was new. This language and framework was completely different from Rails and Express, but it still had some similarities. It gave me a new appreciation for the challenges
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  * Spring Annotations
  * Java and Spring Conventions ( Entities, Repositories, Services, Controllers )
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  * Ask for help next time...
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  * Wasn't in a pair...
## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  * The biggest technical challenge was determining how the database would look and the subsequent SQL queries needed.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  * I asked for advice on the database structure and read documentation / googled until I knew how to build the right objects with queries.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  * I developed a stronger grasp of SQL
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  * Materializecss
  * Raw SQL Queries ( Subqueries, json_agg, json_build_object, etc. )
  * Node & Express authentication through express-session

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
  * Caravan App
* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  * Diving through the code and determining what it was doing. The database made little sense until further examination, and the testing was not what I was used to.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  * I read the rails documentation
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  * Going through the codebase and seeing how others code in Rails was a nice breath of fresh air. It showed me some interesting concepts and left me with some questions as to why the developers chose to make the decisions they did.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  * ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  * has_and_belongs_to_many


## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
* The biggest piece of feedback for this inning was my lack of outreach for help. I seem to have trouble separating the fact we are not in this alone. I know in the job, I will be more proactive about asking for guidance and help when needed, but at the school I had this paradigm or mental block that prevented me from seeking it when I needed it most. It was probably due to pride or ego, but those sound hollow, and don't feel truthful. If it was close to anything, it would probably be because, in my mind, getting through this course was a personal challenge that I put upon myself. There is this unreachable ideal version of myself that I have constructed, and to which I build standards off of that I hold myself towards. If I were to attain this goal of the ideal, then that would mean the ideal is false, and a new one must take its place. Basically I have set myself up to reach for something that I can't ever grasp, but will always work towards. A carrot at the end of a stick...

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
* I felt that the planning of the gear up was smooth and natural. The group was for the most part in agreement for delegating out our duties and what we would all be responsible for. During the first gear up, where we planned what the general outline would be, we had already solidified the schedule for the gear up. I enjoyed the experience in so far as I was able to talk about a topic that I have been passionate about for some years now. It felt great to be able to hear everyone else's interest in it too. As for the most challenging part of the gear up, it was probably the fact I couldn't stop sweating and became self conscious of it. Rather vain I know, but really this was a smooth process, and any challenges that came up were merely trivial.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
* I didn't add much back to the community this inning. I know it is important to at least try and make a contribution to the culture and community of Turing, since it is a core piece that can help people get through, and feel welcome. I just wasn't as involved.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
* First skill will be my best strength, that was built upon while at Turing. That would be my obsessive conviction to keeping to a schedule. Once I start strict schedule, and follow it for a week, it becomes my way of living.
* Second would be communication with my peers. I find that working as a team is the best part about Turing, and constant communication is the bread and butter of a great team in my opinion.
* On the technical side, TDD, code reviews, and a committed git workflow is something I will take with me. That and the added pressure of giving my all to the job, so that I feel I am worthy of being called a developer.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md):
[The Work Plan](https://gist.github.com/AtmaVichara/a73b4b2670665f9c61035e029001106f)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
  * I had spent most of my life working in gyms and retail, while constantly reading, researching, dieting, and exercising, to keep myself in order. At one point I wished to attain my degree in philosophy, but having a professor detail out the options for employment left a rather sour taste in the back of my throat. Having previously been exposed to software development in C++, I found the patterns and concepts of programming interesting and most importantly, challenging. The mental stimulation was something I lacked in all my jobs, and felt that I needed a challenge. So enter 2017, where I am at a crossroads in my life. I have decided to either give all my things away, which pretty much happened anyways, and take a friends offer to go to Tibet and join a Buddhist temple, or check out what this Turing school is all about. In the end I entered Turing, not due to some realization that this was the better choice, but merely that it was a new challenge that could open up a wide range of opportunities. In the process of going through Turing, I developed my own monk lifestyle. Giving up all distractions, enjoyments, and following a strict schedule of asceticism. The skills I have learned, both personally and technically, are tools I will utilize to give back to everyone that wishes to reach their absolute potential. 
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
