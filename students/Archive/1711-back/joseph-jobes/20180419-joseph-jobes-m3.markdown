# Joseph Jobes - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal coming into module 3 was to figure out what I wanted to accomplish for a personal project. This ended up being disastrous in the end, and left a sour taste in my mouth with my failure. Besides that my other goals were as simple as to learn all that was involved in the mod. I had no expectations or even preconceptions of what the mod would be like, so I just went in with the goal to try my best and keep up with everyone in the class.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 1 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2 |

### Takeaways
I came to a rough realization that my own self direction is lacking. I may understand the concepts that we work on, I may be able to work well in paired projects, but self direction with a personal project is where I floundered. Along with this, I neglected to consider the community beyond scheduling coffee meetings and making cold outreaches, but that pertains more to the Professional Development side of things.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* This was a Rails project introducing us to the OAuth process and consuming the Github API.
>* This project was really interesting in that the TDD process was completely new, since we were using OAuth for signing in and using an api call to gather the data that would be displayed on the page. This was also my first introduction with parsing out json to use in our views.

> **[Mat Track](https://github.com/AtmaVichara/mat_track)**
>* This was my attempt at creating an app that would allow instructors to sign up their schools, schedule their events and lessons, and track students attendance / progress.
>* The real takeaway for me was coming to the understanding that I need to spend more time planning and detailing out what my personal project will be, if I decide to take one up. The first week was spent trying to figure out what I would make, even though I had the base understanding of what needed to be included for it to work, then the next few weeks were spent floundering with some horrible code management and self direction. All in all a significant personal failure.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/AtmaVichara/rails-engine)**
>* This project was a Rails API that had some advanced activerecord queries for business analytics on transactions between merchants and items.
>* This was a great introduction into learning the TDD process for developing APIs and working with JSON.

> **[Battleshift](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* This project created an API implementation of the game Battleship. It was our first experience with working on brownfield code.
>* This was an amazing time for pairing with a partner, and learning to traverse other peoples code.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
I'm going to be completely honest. The gear ups were definitely great, but they were all things that I was aware of. The group think gear up was interesting in that we had to speak about group think, while trying to not participate in it since we are all in a setting that could lead easily to group think. The gear up I remember most is the microagressions gear up, which was interesting as well. I agree with all that was taught during the gear up, but felt that there was a dissociation from the root of the problem. Speaking with everyone in the class, who all agrees on the subject of microagressions being harmful, can lead to an echo chamber. Although this leads back towards the group think gear up in that, if someone there was someone who disagreed with the talk, they wouldn't feel comfortable talking up. Either way gear ups were fun for what they are.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
  * I did not post another blog, lead any posses, or anything really besides pairing up with a few mod 2 students during their projects. I also paired with one mod 1 student to help him work on his linked list project. Besides those few pairings which probably counted up to 4 times, I did not add to the community as much as I would have liked.

#### **Posse**
  * I went to my posse meeting once this module, and all we did was go to a bar for a quick drink.
