## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
- My primary focus was working on the job hunt, not abandoning ruby on rails, and be receptive to learning javascript. My primary accomplishment in this module was spending time to learn about front-end packages, the history of javascript, and exploring java/spring as a language/framework for my quantified-self-project. By graduation, I hope to get some rest, send out some cold outreach to individuals at new relic, discogs, and nike.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
  - Understanding what the technical challenge was asking for.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - The opportunity to revisit Quantified-Self.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - I started writing tests for the features that were expected and running migrations.
* What did you learn?
  - Feature testing in javascript is exceptionally challenging.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest challenge?
  - Speaking slowly while I am trying to articulate the things pertaining to Turing's curriculum. For instance, the question about how amazon stores its user shopping history was a challenge. I failed to remember the significance of a session, cache and perhaps a database or purchases.  
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - It was a pleasure to be asked about data structures and have a solid understanding of the utility. Linked lists are great because of their pointers where as an array is great for its indexing.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - When speaking about the session, I stated that it is something I need to revisit.
* What did you learn?
  - That circular linked lists are a thing. The tail points to the head.

## Quantified Self

 Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?   
  - Synchronizing the backend with the frontend.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
   - Formatted the front end to listen for requests and responses from the B.E.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - It gave me an appreciation for the difficulty in creating a full-stack web application.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - JAVA/Spring runs tests, compiles, then builds your application
  - Learned about event handlers and the difficulty of testing within JS.
  - Learned about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) where a special port is inserted into the header of an application for the front end to know where to listen to the back end.
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
  - I would deploy regularly, utilize pivotal tracker instead of waffle.io, and try out more types of testing.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
  - This was a solo project
  
## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
   - Working with the blippar API.
   - Sending an image over a post request
   - Working with forms in node.js and express

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
  - The project was reformatted within the last three days to a smaller scope.
  - I garnered an appreciation for the conventions, opinions of rails vs the nature of express.js as a framework similar to sinatra.
  - As for the forms, I utilized a tutorial and reduced the scope of my application to a single page through html and css.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
  - An appreciation for the differences between payloads and good old rails partials.
  - That I can make sense of tutorials outside of Turing's curriculum.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - The importance of tls over https for security.
  - The need to format a middleware for listening to a post request and parsing it.
  - Deploying node.js projects to heroku requires a lot of debugging.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
    - A caravan application that was completed by a single individual at a hacker night.
* What was your biggest technical challenge?
   - Understanding the codebase including some of the code smells like a circular dependencies.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
   - Relied on my partners work.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
   - Reading code compared to writing it.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
  - Circular dependencies are a bad idea
  - ActiveDispatch as a testing tool
  - Open source contributions are interesting. 

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
  - Sal provided strong coaching on the right way to handle questions you're not sure of during an interview: say that your not familiar with said concept, explain the hunch you have about what it is, and add articulate everything you know about that concept.
  - David Whittaker provided solid instruction on the importance of cold out reach over applying through the door. I am going to go to a lot of meetups in Portland (see calendar below).

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
  - The gear up was a pleasure. It's always fun to educate lower inning students. Biohacking is an interesting concept. Not sure I would implant a transit pace in my arm. Still, I enjoyed explaining some genetics to students.
 - A challenging component is the aspect of coordinating among 4 people while everyone is trying to find a job.


## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
   - Student representative with Joe.
   - Added a job board to the back of the classroom.
   - This is a required component of the Turing curriculum because its a form of networking as well as education.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
  - Data Visualization
  - After landing a position, I would potentially like to be a mentor to reciprocate the coaching that I was so gracious to receive from Mark Miranda and Heidi Hoopes.
  - Feedback for coworkers
