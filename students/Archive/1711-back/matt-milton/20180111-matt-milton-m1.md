# Matt Milton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* My primary goal was to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language and design principles that govern object-oriented programming. Ideally, by doing this, I would also pass the module. Over the past six weeks, I feel that I have grown and learned a lot. I would consider this growth a success.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I think I struggled with encapsulation - particularly, I struggled understanding when to use attr_reader and attr_accessor - and hashes. The main takeaways from these struggles were learning how useful the ruby docs are in explaining concepts and more importantly, how useful my fellow students are to aid in clarifying difficult subjects.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite project was Night Writer because it was the first opportunity to work with another student. Overall, our group dynamic made the project uniquely rewarding. It was quite valuable to consider string manipulation for capital letter which are stored as a cap shift character in braille. From a technical standpoint, this was a fun exercise in nested arrays, constants, classes, and file input output. Not to mention it was fun to learn about braille and it forced me to consider the difficulties of the blind.

* Although I enjoyed all the projects, if I had to pick one my least favorite was HTTP yeah you know me. I felt like this project launch lacked adequate explanation. It was also pretty confusing to use faraday for feature testing when the majority of our classroom discussions were on integration and unit testing.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* Primarily, I learned the importance of asking for help when I was stuck. In HTTP Yeah You Know Me, I felt like I was floundering for awhile trying to understand the spec. By talking with fellow students, my confusion was clarified, and I soon made significant inroads on the project. These inroads include: the difference between a get/post request, that a 301 code means the url moved permanently, the structure of a url code (the path ? parameter), and that servers are structured as a loop that only breaks if a condition is met. One of the most profound takeaway's for me was when Sal said that the internet is just strings on a wire, because strings are the only datatype agnostic to the language they are programmed in.

* From jungle beat, I learned that terminal can "say" things and more importantly, the structure of a linked list. A head points to the first object in the list and the tail points to nothing. This, typically, recursive data structure is more efficient then an array because each item in the linked list only knows about its state and its neighbor. Nothing in a linked list knows about the size of the list whereas Ruby always creates empty storage space for an array.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* The main lesson I took away from the paired projects is the value of working with another individual. Both Ellen and Megan were great at keeping my code writing honest. They demanded that variables, arguments, methods, and classes were named idiomatically. Additionally, by working with a partner, it became abundantly clear how valuable it is to discussing one's logic as one is coding. This process streamlines working through complex projects. Lastly, it was really fun to see how there are multiple ways of coding the same functionality, and how my partners offered solutions that varied from mine.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite Gear-Up the developer identity discussion where we evaluated using LinkedIn and Twitter for career opportunities. Ellen's explanation of changing your linked in url was particularly helpful! Her emphasis on using complete sentences and avoiding bullet points on LinkedIn was also educating. Brittany boasting about all the job offers she received from twitter broadened my eyes about the utility of social media for acquiring an occupation. I suppose I am curious if she ever took one of those jobs but that's neither here nor there.  


* Health & Wellness 2 was my least favorite because I feel like the models presented were overly simplified. For instance, the tri-uine brain is a very simplistic model of one's nervous system. Although I found the overall takeaway of the importance of sleep and mental health to be enlightening, I think the data used to argue that takeaway was a tad underwhelming.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I contributed to the Turing community by participating in the Turing held events, demo night, meditation, and guest speakers. Additionally, I tried to come-in after hours and on weekends, with the explicit purpose of working with other students. This allowed me to start some relationships that I hope continue after Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would like to offer my help to other students more and perhaps, offer some coding advice to the incoming cohort. I would also like to attend more lunch meetups. Best case scenario is that one of my projects receives fours and I feel confident submitting it to a code-fair. Maybe later on, I could give a lightning talk.
