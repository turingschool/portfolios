# Matt Milton - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The main area of emphasis for this module was to understand application programming interfaces. Additionally, I wanted to hone my relational database skills.

Turing is fun.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/mgmilton/api_curious) (Optional)**

- The primary purpose of this project was to make a mock GitHub website.
- Github's API is a comparatively easy API to consume.

> **[Self Directed](https://github.com/mgmilton/health_maps)**

 - An application capable of gathering health information for each neighborhood for the 500 most populous cities in the united states.
 - Hashies are a weird way to store information in a database. There's a lot of work that goes into data munging.

## B: Group Work & Projects

- [Rales Engine](https://github.com/mgmilton/rails_engine)**
- This project utilizes Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes sales data selected from Etsy. This api serves up business analytics, relational endpoints, and record endpoints. For a full explanation of the endpoints, look at this endpoint explanation. Below is a database schema explaining the relationships between each endpoint: merchant, customer, items, invoices, transactions and invoice items.
>* This was a fun one. A lot of activerecord, sql, and working with a partner who respected my desire to work remotely.  

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
- Not applicable.
- Not applicable.

## C. **Gear Ups**
- The micro-aggressions gear up was great. I think the larger point that was missed was that micro-aggressions are defined culturally. For instance, the hegemonic culture in the Yucatan is Spanish and not Mayan. Furthermore, it's also a bit tedious to hear white women from boulder talk about men as the sole perpetrator of micro-aggressions when one could argue that the most historically protected members of the human species has been and continues to be white women. Nonetheless, in the context of Turing, white women will most likely be the recipients of future micro-aggressions which is why that session is so valuable. Perhaps it could replace the improve session in week one? I think moving it to the beginning of a student's time at Turing would greatly advance future DTR's, allow for better workflow across sexual and gender lines, and perhaps allow for better projects as a whole.  

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
- I lead a linkedin lunch, gave the cohort a sql book that I found helpful, and wrote a blog about big o (https://medium.com/@matt.milton/big-bad-o-3585f1e5af10).

#### **Posse**
- Not applicable.

#### **Playing a Part**

- I thought my questions in class were thoughtful and worth the time of the instructors. Sometimes I over-complicated things with said questions but as a whole, I felt like a valuable contributor to the community.
