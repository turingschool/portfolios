## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* Going in to Mod 1, my main goal was to successfully complete the module while maintaining some degree of my life outside of Turing.  Though my initial expectations for the time commitment that Turing would be, I do think that I was able to accomplish this goal - I have a good understanding of the topics that we covered in the module and have been able to schedule time to spend with friends and family.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* In the first couple of weeks of the module, I struggled with asking for help.  I knew coming in to this experience that asking for help has never yet been one of my strengths and it was stressing me out until I started looking outside myself and realizing that everyone I was working with was asking for help.  The environment at Turing really helped me through this struggle and helped me learn to focus not so much on "I can't do it", but more on what resources are available to me and how to reach out for help.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* Complete Me and Black Thursday have been my favorite projects.  I enjoyed complete me because it was a look into computer science and data structures that I have never had before - it was also a good one to show friends/family what I have accomplished. And Black Thursday has been great because I really enjoy working with databases and business analysis.

* My least favorite project was HTTP: Yeah You Know Me.  I am glad that we did this project - I think it was a great look under the hood of technology that we use on a daily basis, but it was my least favorite because I felt more in-th-dark on that project than on any other.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* To ask for help early!  Without a partner to bounce ideas off of, I have a tendancy to just stare at my computer, rather than getting up and finding help.  The independent projects have helped and will continue to help me get through this particular struggle.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* It is very difficult to balance the level of learning and comprehension of each partner.  In this environment where everyone is trying to learn as much as they can, it can be difficult for me to put the needs of the partnership ahead of getting the project completed.  I think this is helping me to speak up when I don't quite understand something yet, but that is definitely something that I will continue to work on.  I also need to find a good way to stop a workflow when I recognize that my partner is not completely comprehending something in the code.  So, what I've learned from paired projects is that I have a lot to learn about working with a partner.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite Gear Up was the one led by Mod 4 students.  I went to the session on having a fixed mindset.  I enjoyed that one the most because it was in a small group setting where I felt more comfortable speaking up and because they did a GREAT job sticking to an agenda that had varied activities (reflecting, sharing, code-challenge, videos) which kept us all engaged through the whole session.

* My least favorite Gear Ups were the Stress sessions.  The content was excellent, but being in such a large group is not a relaxing environment for me and I don't think the large groups lend themselves to meaningful gear up discussions.  I would have loved these sessions if they were broken up into groups of 10-15 students.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I tried to be open, friendly and helpful in all of my interactions with other students.  I also joined the Joan Clarke Society which has been a great way for me to connect with the other women of Turing and connect with students across modules.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

* I would really like to get involved in more groups on campus and eventually take on a leadership role, either as a SAB rep or leading a posse.
