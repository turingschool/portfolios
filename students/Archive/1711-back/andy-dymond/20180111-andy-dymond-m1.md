# Andy Dymond - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * Technically, this module I set out to learn the fundamentals of Ruby as well as to improve my approach to algorithmic logic. I accomplished both of these goals throughout the mod via homework exercises, projects and collaborating/learning from peers and mentors.

  * Personally I set out to improve my ability to focus, and I found that the challenges presented by the projects and curriculum forced me organize my approach to work and focus intently on the task at hand during the (relatively) short amount of time I had to work. Pomodoro breaks were also a godsend in helping me improve my focus.

  * Additionally, I wanted to make sure to develop relationships with mentors and peers. In high school and college, I found myself working through projects/assignments alone, without really getting to know professors or students in my classes. This mod I've improved on that with a couple of mentors and upper mod students, but I think I could work even harder to reach out to instructors and upper mod students.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * This module I think I struggled most with paying attention to exercises and materials that weren't directly related to the project at hand. I've learned from this that paying attention to these materials is really important, and even if I can't see a direct link between certain materials and the project assigned, the concepts gleaned from these materials are almost always helpful in accomplishing whatever tasks the project demands of you.


## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  * I honestly really enjoyed all of the projects this module, so it's a tough call. I'd have to put Http Yeah You Know Me at the top of the list, as I felt it was the most demanding project in terms of applying concepts we'd learned to concepts we had to pick up on the fly. It was probably the scariest project to start, and because of that the most satisfying to finish. My least favorite was event manager, which I realize is more of a tutorial than a full-fledged project, but I feel like I would have retained more of the info imparted if it made us work just a little bit harder to get through each iteration. That said, it's a great reference to keep on hand for starting Black Thursday.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
  * This mod, all but my last project were independent projects, so I learned a lot from them. One main takeaway I had from working through these projects alone was that time management and task planning is key to getting started and keeping on schedule when the only person you are accountable to is yourself. The second takeaway was that even when working alone, you shouldn't try to work completely alone all the time; I don't think I could have completed any of the projects in the allotted time without help and feedback from peers and mentors.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
  * Working in a pair on Black Thursday taught me how important it is to define the relationship and setup your workflow tools(via github, waffle, etc) before getting caught up in actual project work. This what my partner and I did day one, and I feel as though it really allowed us to set up our expectations and communication so we could work together as a single unit with two arms. I feel like our collaboration was very easy, and we had the advantage of having similar work ethics, planning approaches, and sleep schedules. I think the upfront planning would be even more important if we didn't have such similar approaches to work.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  I really liked the health and wellness gear-ups, I feel like I lose touch with myself when I'm working hard and am stressed, and those gear-ups were really helpful for reminding me that taking care of myself is fundamental to my technical, personal, and professional development. My least favorite was the school social (not sure if this was a gear up but it fell at normal gear up times), because it felt more like an opportunity for every student to kind of do their own thing rather than actually be social. Personally I benefit from more structure than that, but also understand it might be welcomed by a lot of people.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I got to know two mentors and many upper mod students in both front and backend programs. In my own cohort, I tried to be an active participant in class, my posse, and tried to help/collaborate with my peers whenever possible.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I'd like to get more involved in the Turing Community, perhaps by working with people to start some kind of community based blogging? I've heard a lot of people talk about their blog posts, but haven't actually seen any of their posts. Over break I plan to check some peers blogs out and start out with some technical posts on Medium as well. I'd also like to join a technically-oriented posse and hopefully get good enough to lead it the following module!
