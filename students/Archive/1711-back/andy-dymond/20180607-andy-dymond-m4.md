# B4 Portfolio Template
ANDY DYMOND

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

* Getting comfortable working in languages and environments I'm unfamiliar with.
* Learning more frontend.
* Making headway on networking, the job hunt & landing at least an interview (and hopefully a job!)

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- The SQL stuff while attempting to serialize the json returned

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- The difficulty level

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Research & experimenting w sql returns & aggregators

* What did you learn?
- More about PostGres's JSON_AGG function

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
- Figuring out where to start while whiteboarding

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Talking about OOP and explaining some of the pillars

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Started writing stuff on the board

* What did you learn?
- To start with less pseudo code and more high level stuff on the whiteboard

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- working in a brand new language with no Turing curriculum to rely on

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Research & collaboration w classmates

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Working in a functional-language-based ORM

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- pattern matching
- CORS
- hooking a frontend up to a backend API

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
- Move faster, I felt like we were given WAY too much time to work on the projects (I think we could have done all three iterations in 2 weeks instead of 3 and it would have felt like a more Turing pace, and we could have spent more time finding an issue & making more/ or more meaningful open source contributions)

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
- we didn't pair on this project

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- Getting around crawler protections implemented by websites surrounding price (finding the right urls to work with and using proxy servers)

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Reading

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Working with totally new concepts in a language I hadn't touched before

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- writing bash scripts
- webscraping
- proxy rotation

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
Jekyll Relative Links

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- (~re)learning Regex

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- Reading

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Getting involved in another person's codebase, communicating with that person and ultimately the feeling of getting a PR merged!

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- Static site generation
- Markdown as fixtures
- Iterative Regex

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
- I appreciated hearing feedback on my initial capstone plan & a reality check as to the scale of my scraping in my time frame
- I also appreciated our assigned PD mentors, who have been very helpful in checking cover letters & cold outreach notes
## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
- I enjoyed the experience but the topics are kind of silly large given the ~3 hours we have to prepare in school. Preparation outside of school did happen, but was definitely lost in the noise of job hunt & projects. I truly think mod4 gear ups would be much better as a week 1 activity, as I found the value we got much more related to meeting lower mod folks, and given current mod4 prework, I think groups would have plenty of time to come up with as-good-or-better-content over break following a last thursday or friday of mod 3 kick off.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
Helped a few students in mods 1, 2 & 3 with credit check, rails & js issues.
Got more involved in the greater dev community going to meetups & continuing to attend Code for Denver (which I got a job lead from!)

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
- Learning things I don't know really quickly on my own & with help from seniors if needed
- Jerverscerpts
- Environment configuration & scripting

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
* [THE PLAN](https://gist.github.com/andymond/4aea15f3ce1bcf9dcd0a7b10b43abb8c)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
