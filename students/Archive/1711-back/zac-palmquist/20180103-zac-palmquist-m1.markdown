# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## #Areas of Emphasis

  This mod was a huge make it or break it challenge for myself. On my break before repeating I spent a lot of time refining my skills not only in code but
also made it a point to get my logical part of my brain working on overdrive. I've been really proud of the work I've done this Mod and I am so excited to dive
in deeper with Web Frameworks in Mod2! This mod I made it a point to try to be as helpful as possible. I extended my hands to anyone who was struggling that
I thought I could help. Especially in the first couple weeks. I wanted to give people a chance to get an explanation from someone who came in really knowing
nothing and hopefully save them a bunch of time that I spent just frustrated and lost.

Despite all of my hard work and even though my code was much better this go around...I held myself to a really high standard this module and while I don't think I quite met my own standard I still feel like I've come such a long way. This module I learned about being better to myself emotionally and physically. I've learned so much through all of the struggles and the struggles have become so much more bearable now that I feel like I'm actually learning instead of just drowning in all of the new information.

## # Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  It's between Date Night and Black Thursday just because I learned so much and didn't expect to do near as well as I thought I would. I remember the school gave people
a whole week for BST last time and I think that in the few full days I had to do what I did, I'm incredibly happy with the results and I wouldn't trade the long
hours I spent in the basement grinding that out for anything. I learned about recursion, which was a really scary concept for me and its exciting to occasionally
realize I can use that now. Its like having a new tool in your toolbox. Ive also learned that I can now "do the thing" but I'm ready to learn how to take things to the next level and learn how to do things that much better.

  Least favorite project was probably Mastermind. I felt like I learned the least with Mastermind and I really don't like making REPL's. They annoy me. This project
wasn't done w/o any merit though! It was still a challenge that revisited a lot of older concepts and I didn't get as far as I would have liked so, still a challenge. I really appreciate that it was still challenging in Mod1 Round 2. I'm so glad I wasn't just bored with the Mod.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?

  The best thing that I walked away with was a clear understanding of recursion and how / when to use it. Also keeping the stack in mind while I code has been very
helpful. I also learned more about the concept of Nodes and we really hit that concept hard this Mod. I'm so glad I did these projects and I'm ready for what else Turing has to serve me up.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I learned how to have frank much needed conversations with allies on my team and how to find my place in a project. Last mod I would just do what I could and
this time I took more initiative in what I wanted to do and with a better knowledge this go around on what I'm good at, it made it easy to sink right into my
place in these projects. Of course, also more code. Keep coding. All the time.

## # Community

## What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  As a repeater a lot of the Gear Ups were a drag just because it was the same thing again. I love that Turing does these but to hear the exact same thing again is tedious. I think my least favorite is the life map Gear Up because its hard to encapsulate everything into "ups and downs". I think that while a story telling lesson is a good thing
because people need to be comfortable w/ themselves and proud of their story. There might be a better way to do something similar.

## How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I actually wish we did more of the sessions where us repeaters talk in front of the class but, Cameron and I led discussions in front of the class and I was quick
to jump to help someone out if I saw them struggling and I felt like I could explain whats going wrong and also help guide them to the answer w/o giving them
answers. It was a lot easier to teach people things weeks 1 - 3 but now its been sort of an even playing field. We've had a super strong cohort this round and I really like the crew. I was actively trying not to be cliquey with the repeaters and I noticed we were being like that at first but this cohort grew on me (as they do) and I'm glad to be a part of their experience here. This cohort was super strong and inspiring to see them get at it so quickly and so hard. Also, I am getting comfortable with the idea of hosting SAD sessions and representing the class.

## What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to try to get more cohorts to hang out outside of school and not just feel like we have to talk shop all of the time. There are a lot of bright, wonderful people in this cohort and anything I can do to make the experience great is something that I'd love to do.
