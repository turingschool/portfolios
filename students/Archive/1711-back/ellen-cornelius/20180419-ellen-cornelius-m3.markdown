# \Ellen Cornelius - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

>* I accomplished moving onto the final round of lightening talks, and participating in GoCode and winning the Fort Collins Challenge weekend.
I also feel like I am getting closer to feeling job ready with enough confidence in my technical abilities to go into interviews.
I did a lot this mod to prepare for the job hunt such as updating my resume, online profiles, cold outreach and creating a personal blog and writing 2 blog posts.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* This is one project I did not put too much time into because I was more focused on giving a really good lightening talk.
However, I think I got what I needed to out of it in that I felt really strong making different kinds of API calls after this,
and learned so much about Oauth and all the steps involved, how to test it, and how gems remove certain steps for you to make it easier.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* The only thing I would have liked to do better was have my personal project be demo-able. I have a chance to do this in Mod 4.
I also wanted to incorporate more geospatial analysis before turning it in. I started with very high expectations of what I wanted to accomplish in this project,
which was not realistic with my participation in GoCode the last weekend. However, I still enjoyed the experience and learned a ton about MapBox, researching different APIs,
using Google Maps and working with lat/longs coordinates, converting from XML to JSON, front-end technologies and deploying and troubleshooting Heroku.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* I really liked this project and enjoyed working with my partner. I really enjoy doing ActiveRecord and SQL problems.
Also, Serializers were so cool to learn about - they are like the views that backend people
can be passionate about (and don't involve CSS)!!!

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* This was the most challenging project, but in retrospect I feel like it was the most valuable. Starting with a codebase I knew nothing about which used techniques I had never seen
before was very hard, but the more time I spent with the code the more I felt like it started to become my own. By the end of the project,
I had a much better understanding of Ruby and serializers.

## C. **Gear Ups**

>* I didn't think the Gear Ups this Module were very valuable, and was pretty disappointed with them in general. I don't think I learned
anything more that I already knew about how to cold outreach, reflect on what you want in a job, where to look for jobs, etc. The only extremely valuable things this Module was the Resume Review with Ellen Mary,
the job shadow at Comcast (with mock interview!) and the resume/cover letter examples link Turing has.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
  >* Wrote a blog post, attended and won first round of GoCode, and paired with folks from Mod2.

#### **Posse**
  >* I attended Pahlka posse, and through it I was able to get to know an amazing group of people that I ended up forming a team with for GoCode CO.

#### **Playing a Part**

  >* I really liked getting to see what other people did in my cohort for their personal projects. It was all very inspiring to see the stuff my classmates were accomplishing.
