 ## Areas of Emphasis
 What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
 What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

 Coming back into mod 1 for the second time I had alot better understanding of what was to come. My first time through was kinda
 a train wreck. Wouldn't say because I didn't try but wasn't prepared for what Turing was. This time through though was a whole
 different world. In class I was able to grasp concepts that the first time through wasn't. Because when we would start to cover a new subject. I was still trying to figure out what we did last week. That continued to compound week by week until I couldn't breathe at all. The second time through was exactly what I needed to concrete in these concepts. I still have alot of learning to do but I did choose a profession that you never stop learning and truthfully that really excites me. I love being exposed to new concepts and being challenged on a daily bases. Which is exactly what I have found at Turing. I would say what I struggled the most with this mod is the idea at times would pop into my head that "do i even belong here". "What if I don't make it this time". "Am I even capable of doing this". But when those thoughts arose I would just through them out and get back to studying. I believe I have came along way this second time through and have made alot more really good friends. Had a new teacher Sal. Which is an amazing teacher and Turing is lucky to have someone that cares so much about the students on the staff. But lets not also forget about Mike and Victoria. Mike also goes above and beyond for the students. The instructional
 videos he makes and posts on the channel has really help me along this journey  . Which I think is really cool he takes his own
 time to make those videos to help out the students. Victoria on multiple occasions has sat down with me and helped with
 concepts I was having a hard time with. Even at times during my first time through mod 1 when i was really down on my self. She
 really helped me get through that. I want to thank Turing for finding three great teachers.

 ## Projects
 What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
 What did you learn from your independent projects?
 What did you learn from your paired projects?

 I would say my favorite project was the "HTTP-Yeah you know me". I really enjoyed that one because I loved the concepts that I
 learned during that project. I found learning how gets and posts worked really fun. Also really enjoyed working on Black Thursday. Alot of the project we did as a team on one computer as driver and navigator. Which also really help ingrain alot of the concepts for the team as a whole. Something I gained from the project was having a better understanding of git and github. The first time through git and github was a complete nightmare for me. I couldn't get almost anything to work without some type of merge conflict or some other error. Which wasn't fun at all. It just made everything that much harder. Something I have gained from the paired projects is learning how to look at a problem with a different set of eyes and approach it from a completely different direction.


 ## Community
 What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
 How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
 What would you like to do to contribute next module?

 My favorite session was the one dealing with stress. Because I sure know I have had my fair share of that at Turing. Even at the beginning of the gear up when she started talking about stress I could feel my heart BPM's starting to rise. She had some really awesome ideas on ways to deal with the stress of learning to program or just with dealing with the stress of daily life.
 This time around I had alot more to offer the Community and fellow students. My first paired project my partner was having a really hard time with some of the concepts so i was able to make him some videos trying to explain what was happening in the code. Which actually made me feel really good that I have been able to make it to a point that I can offer some help back. Because I sure know I have been given alot of that. Something else I really don't regret about repeating is that now I know almost everyone at the school and have grow alot of relationships with the upper mod students. In mod 2 "if everything goes as planned" lol. I really want to help out the new mod-1 students because I know i'm getting to the point where i can offer some help. I have been given so much help my time at Turing and I want to help out as much as I can. Because I know as well as the next person I know the feeling of drowning every day and feeling like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. But on the positive side of that is that I am starting to see the light and ready to give back.
