 # First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I set out to grasp a solid foundation in Ruby and object-oriented programming. My goal was to build a solid foundation in order to move onto the next mod without struggle. I was not successful at this attempt as I'm still struggling with the basics of Ruby and the flow of information.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled with managing my time for projects homework and exercises. I felt that because I didn't fully understand some of the basics the projects took up most of my time and I was not able to fully focus on the homework or exercises. Another thing that I struggled with was breaking the problem into smaller problems and finding solutions and building from that, I think this is part of why I struggle with logic. I also need to better understand the flow of information in my applications.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* Flashcards for me was probably my favorite project. It allowed me to see how visualize and understand how the basics of an application works. For example, I was a able to see how single responsibility works through and application.

My least favorite project was Jungle Beats where we dealt with nodes at first it was difficult to conceptualize what a node is suppose to be or do, but for the most part I think after the project I have some what of an understanding. It was difficult to learn about nodes while to still earning about the basics of Ruby.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned more about more methods by working on my own projects. I also felt like I got better at utilizing pry for my projects. It was a struggle for me to work on some of these projects because the logic is a weak point for me at this time.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* I thought that paired projects were great and really allowed us to see how the work flow happens when to devs work together. I really like utilizing the Driver - Navigator pairing method. This was helpful to me because since I don't have a solid foundation on logic yet this allowed me explain to the other person what methods I think should be used.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* I feel like all the gear up sessions were helpful. I especially liked the ones about self care. Through this mod I learned that taking care of yourself is important in order to be successful.

I don't feel like there was a gear up session that was not useful I feel like they all served a purpose. 

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I made some really good friends this mod and hope to continue that onto the next mod. I feel our cohort became a close group and that the support for each other will continue.

What would you like to do to contribute next module
* Next module I would like to be more active in maybe joining more groups. I would like to maybe be more active in class as far as asking questions. I was a bit shy at first and maybe need to be more outgoing and open next mod.
