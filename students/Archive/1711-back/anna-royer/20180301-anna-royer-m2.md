## Areas of Emphasis

##### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* From my notes week 1 (mod 2 goal setting):
  * fluency with the tools and languages we are learning
  * ability to build a project in a framework and understand all the smaller pieces
  * Being able to build it myself without looking at / copying code from examples
  * Understand databases
  * Fluency with SQL
  * design database schemas (?)
  * Be able to come up with my own ideas and implement them myself
  * Do a project for fun
  * Be able to work methodically without project specs that spell out every single detail
  * Write tests, html and css that follow good convention and style

* I was successful in accomplishing many of these. I actually do feel a gained a lot more fluency in writing  applications with rails and sinatra that follow basic RESTful conventions than I expected at the beginning of this module.
* I have a much better understanding of databases than I did at the beginning of the module, but I still have much more to learn.
* I can design very straightforward database schema easily, but I still struggle with knowing how to make decisions about what should be stored where and how in a database with anything slightly complex.
* I was able to implement some of my own ideas in my projects this module, and that was exciting and fun.
* I barely know any sql, but I would like to spend time practicing it over the break
* I did not do a project for fun, but I have an idea for a project that I am excited about, and I may try to do it over break
* I did get better at interpreting user stories, and we did have to write our programs this module without our tests 100% spelled out for us in the project specs.
* I do need to be much better about asking the instructors questions consistently and checking in (following the agile approach)
* My html and css (and my tests for the most part) are still pretty sloppy and disorganized, but I do really like sass and am going to work on strategies to better organize these aspects in a project.

##### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* School / Curriculum Specific:
  * I probably struggled most with css and active record
    * I think database relationships and queries are really fun, and I would like to be very adept at activerecord and sql, but there were a lot of things I misunderstood or that were unclear about it
    * I find css to be sloppy and unpredictable and generally frustrating, and I don't have a lot of creative ideas about how to style pages or a good eye for what would work

* Otherwise:
  * I had a hard time adjusting to less structure this module. Many things were very open ended, and I found myself working much harder than I needed to at some points, and falling into less structured life habits like sleeping less and waking up later. I also feel bad that I was late to class this morning !
  * I generally felt overwhelmed by the world of information that sort of opened up to us this module. It's exciting, but definitely overwhelming.

  * I learned how important it is for me to create structure for myself in order to be succesful. I need to get enough sleep, and make it a habit to spend time practicing coding and preparing for classes daily. Towards the end of the module, I got a little bit lax about these habits and I felt I fell behind on some things very quickly.
  
## Blog

Link your blog post here. Include a short description of your topic (one sentence is fine).
[My Blog Post](https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/anna-royer-blog/debug-in-production)

This blog post is on how to open a rails project locally in production. It is based on the beginning of the lesson we had on the asset pipeline. I felt it would be helpful to have these steps layed out very clearly to return back to later.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* My favorite was Rails Mini Project. It was the perfect size of project - I could wrap my head around completing the whole thing, but it was still very engaging and interesting. I also liked that having gifs all over my webpage let me off the hook styling-wise a little bit..

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* I learned that I can build complete web applications by myself from start to finish
* The independent projects gave me a lot of practice with REST conventions and Rails

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* I learned the most about database queries and active record from my paired projects
* I learned how to communicate more effectively about code
* I learned strategies for organizing group projects and planning agendas for collaborating

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* My favorite Gear Up was the one on empathy where we watched some of code-debugging the gender gap, and had small group discussions in class.
  * I watched Code-Debugging the Gender Gap at the first meetup I ever went to when I first got interested in coding as a hobby, and it sort of set a fire in me. It was interesting to watch it again and notice some things said in the film that I don't agree with now that I am pursuing a career in technology.
  * Our class had a really interesting discussion, and Ali facilitated in a way that allowed us to have an organic discussion and make connections to other related issues.

* My least favorite gear up was probably the tragedy of the commons
  * I liked that we were mixed up with module 3 students, and I thought the subject matter was interesting
  * I felt that our facilitator guided the discussion in a very specific direction, so it felt a little bit contrived. There wasn't a lot of opportunity for us to debate the subject or voice our opinions about it.
  * There was a discussion question in this gear up that should be rephrased. The question asked if a manager aimed to hire a team with at least 30% of people similar to his or herself, what impact would that have. I thought it was interesting that everyone automatically assumed the manager in question was a white male. It would be a different question if we considered whether the manager was a minority in the tech field.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I was a student advisory board representative this module
  * I co-planned and co-led our group cohort retros, made and sent out surveys for our class, attended student advisory board meetings and communicated my peer's concerns to the staff. I posted facilities issues to the trello board and I helped to plan and organize school events like the code fair and the ground hog day fest
* I made a slack channel for everyone in 1711 frontend and backend, so we could encourage some more cross-cohort collaboration (and fun).
* I attended several joan clarke society meetings
* I joined the machine learning posse, although I have not personally contributed much, because I am attending to learn from the students who know much more about machine learning than myself.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I will no longer be on student advisory board, but I would like to continue contributing to the turing community.
* I plan to attend more jcs meetings and become more involved in it, because I think that is a very positive community within turing
* I have been wanting to become involved with the pahlka posse since starting at Turing, but I have never attended a meeting. Next module, I am going to make a solid plan to go to their first meeting and hopefully become involved with the projects they are working on. From what I have heard from other students, the projects they are working on sound really exciting.
