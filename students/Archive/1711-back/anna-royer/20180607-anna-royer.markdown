## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

More confidence and comfort in my job search. A better understanding and knowledge of front end, and an ability to write decent javascript code. I also wanted to come out with some decent, presentable/ polished projects to put on my portfolio in addition to practical knowledge a skills for the job search and interview process.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
With the yummly / knex assessment, my biggest challenge was writing the queries to get back all the necessary information.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked returning to writing raw sql queries, and I think promises + sql makes kind of a fun problem to solve.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I spent a long time diving into the knex docs trying to figure out how I could do it with knex and then I spent a while troubleshooting queries in psql to figure out how to get all the information. Then I just sort of gave in and wrote several sql queries passed around in promises and formatted the json with various javascript enumerables.

After the assessment I remembered the process Josh taught us at the beginning of mod 3 for solving these types of problems, and realized that a similar intentional approach of thinking through and building out the query piece by piece would have helped me a lot.

* What did you learn?
I learned about JSON agg from our class discussion afterwards, and Sal's review of his approach gave me some ideas for how to solve this problem better.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
I realized that there are a lot of concepts I know that I understand, but when I'm asked to describe them, I don't always have clearly-worded straight-forward explanations. I think this is a matter of not just understanding concepts technically, but practicing communicating clearly about what I understand.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
It made me feel more comfortable to go into an actual technical interview and it was nice to get a perspective on effective ways to approach a challenge in an interview and to talk about your process.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
N/A

* What did you learn?
To take the time to clearly map out a plan or an interaction pattern for a problem before diving in. I think this might be my more natural inclination actually, but in an interview atmosphere, I feel some pressure to get going right away and to fill the empty space.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Maybe getting used to promise chaining.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
pryjs which my peers discovered was / has been a total life saver. I also made the connection to how similar it is to making fetch calls, which made everything smoother.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked building the API out first in rails and then using that as a basis to learn express and phoenix. That was a really effective and fun way to pick up new frameworks and have a context to understand them.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
CORS, practice with promises + OOJS and exposure to functional programming, which pretty much just seems like passing structs around everywhere

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I didn't actually learn much elixir / phoenix because I used the phoenix generators for a lot of the third project. I think it would have been good for me to have started with writing the tests and the code myself, even if I was just looking at an example and typing it. That project was mostly just me reconfiguring things for my purposes.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
I had a difficult time understanding how client side authentication / authorization works, and it might not be as complicated as I thought but all the solutions seem like an awkward bandaid to me.
I also found dom manipulation to be a bit tricky / squirrelly and css was time consuming and tedious at times. I think this is mostly because I didn't have practice organizing these things well.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I read a lot of articles online and started a lot of mini spikes but I didn't know really what it was I was looking for exactly. I talked to some front end students who were authenticating their react app with firebase google oauth gave me a direction. Firebase sort of works but has really odd default behavior in my static app with multiple pages.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
It made me really think and learn about security and gaps in my understanding of the authentication / authorization process. Also the ease of auth is something I really appreciate about server-side rendering now.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
sequelize / webpack are new tools I used. I learned a lot of tricks with css and html and got a lot of practice with dom manipulation

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
Boulder Food Robot

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Getting the project set up, specifically the test database, took me a few hours. Then when Ellen ran into the exact same problem, I couldn't even remember the sequence of things I did to fix it.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I followed the README really carefully when setting up, which was mostly just cloning, setting the ruby version and running the setup file. I initially googled the errors, then I read through each line of the setup file and the files it called to pare down where the issue might be, which gave me some direction on fixing the test database permissions. and I was able to then google more specific questions to target possible solutions

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Working on an awesome project and getting to go to boulder ruby night and continue working on it with people there.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
The biggest lesson learned was to make small pull requests. My pull request was entirely syntax errors so I let it get pretty big because they were so easy to fix, but it took my reviewers a long time to look it over. They appreciated my work and enthusiasm and merged my pull request, but they requested smaller PRs in the future. oops.

I also learned a lot of ways to rewrite git history scoped to whatever you want to patch up at the boulder ruby night, because there were some things they requested I change in my PR and some things they requested I just break out into a separate branch / PR.

I learned about bash execution files.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

It was really fun to get to work with some frontend friends on planning this.
I really enjoyed the experience - the people attending our gearup were a really insightful, kind and authentic group which made it a really enjoyable experience, and we had good discussions. It wasn't challenging, but we estimated our timing a little wrong, and probably could have planned ~10 more minutes of content (we were also missing a member)

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I am realizing that I was not very involved in the community this inning, and I wish I had been more involved because I have nothing but gratitude for Turing and for the other students and the community here that has helped me along the way. I did help a couple mod 2 and mod 3 students on their projects this module, and that was actually a really rewarding and fun experience. It's great to feel like I have the knowledge and ability now to effectively help people learn and get past problems.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
1) A good process for solving problems and learning new skills and technologies
2) Knowledge and habits around communicating productively, transparently and kindly with people I am working with / for
3) Habits around and commitment to best practices like TDD and DTRs and peer reviews and refactoring patterns (generally the priority on being intentional about my process)
