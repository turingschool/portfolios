## C. **Gear Ups**

gear ups the gear ups this module were focused on job preparation and provided the most value of the gear ups so far at turing in my opinion.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

this module i gave a lightning talk to three modules of backend students. i also participated in SAB and volunteered to 'work' during the code fair. i chose a route and led a small group bike ride along said route on a nice, sunny day.

#### **Posse**

i participated in one posse this module which was literally just playing mario kart on a nintendo switch. i never lost a tournament and am turing uncontested mario kart champ.
