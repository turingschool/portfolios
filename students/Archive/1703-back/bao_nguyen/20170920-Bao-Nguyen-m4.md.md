# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

* I just want to focus on learning JavaScript and building things that I already know in a completely different framework.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
I think the biggest challenge was learning how to build a React app properly. I just had to do a lot of debugging and learning about state management, as well as learning about passing functions between components.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
React is a good framework. I think I will be much better about my productivity in the front end now with React.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
My approach was simply to go through tutorials and then keep coming at the problem with fresh eyes. A lot of times, my own bugs were the result of me doing something that doesn't play well with React code.
* What did you learn?
I was trying to use functions that required 'this', but out of the component class. They were standalone JS functions, and they cannot bind(this) outside of the component class structure.

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- Rails gives you a few little extras that you don't have in Express. Active Record is also really powerful and abstracts away
a lot of needed thinking. I ran into a problem where Postgres does not allow you to delete only one of a duplicate record.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
 I had to alter the meal_foods table to give it an ID and then create a limit(1) subquery to delete only one food from the meal instead of all of them.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Javascript is cool.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- Webpack, NPM, async programming.
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
- Nothing.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
- Good experience.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Learning React.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Same answer as up above.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Trying to solve a problem in a domain that I have fun it. I think building a project to work with fantasy football is just a fun side project to do and keep motivation.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Front-end frameworks. Using React to manage visual changes in the virtual DOM to speed updates to the view.
Performance - I had to implement caching and also working with the data in the front end so that my server doesn't get overloaded. I do 6 API calls to my server whenever the user hits the site or refreshes.
Dual-apps - Built two different apps and deployed both to production.
## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
* I helped with the gear up on Transhumanism. We got a lot of good feedback and I hope it inspires lower mod students to keep up the quality of their gear ups.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
* The open source project contribution was actually fun and helped to get my feet wet. Now I want to find a good project and help out. It was actually easy to get into.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
* Collaboration, mindfulness, and empathy. These are my weakest skill sets, but I think they make me a better developer than my technical skills ever could.
