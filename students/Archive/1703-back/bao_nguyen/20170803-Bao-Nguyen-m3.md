# Bao Nguyen - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

We started Mod 3 with Rales Engine. This focused on building an API backend only and
then writing SQL queries to solve business intelligence. I liked it very much and
found it to be roughly at my level. Next we did our cloney island projects. Besides
CRUDing out some parts of both apps and building some basic styling, I focused on
learning new concepts. The first project, I built a discreet API backend which used
a JSON Web Token to communicate and authenticate incoming requests. This used a Redis
backend to then replicate changes across different databases. The second project, I focused
on learning websockets and how Action Cable gives us the ability to instantly transfer data
to another person over a Redis server.

>* Honestly I didn't meet my own expectations for this module. I was way too tired at times and didn't
put in the effort in the hard things that needed to get done.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* Talking to the Reddit API sucks. I won't do it again and I would never work for Reddit. Seriously.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Overall, I think this project went well. We communicated well and the project was finished. That said, we didn't DTR properly, which leads to problems on my next project.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* Overall, I think this project turned our really well even though it got pretty disfunctional. I think the group dynamic was fine, but the project itself could have been better.
Part of this, was the lack of a true DTR as well. I think what happened is that the software building process was affected and problems arose because we didn't merge, PR, and
deploy.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* This project went really well. We did a proper DTR and I think all together, the three projects taught me a lot about how to make group projects work better. It helps to make me
a better developer and a better collaborator.

Tough story and delivered!! Tests are thorough for your api and on the main app. Connecting all these things is difficult and you excelled, nice work!

## C. **Gear Ups**

# Session 1: Microaggressions

* How have you experienced microagressions in your time at Turing or in your life?
I typically hear or see a lot of microagressions that have to do with my race. Usually people assume I am good at math,
very quiet, or they ask me where I am from. Not a big deal, and whatever.

* What ways have you been able to address microagressions that you have seen happen?

I have not addressed microagressions before except once when I brought up how a fellow classmate asked another person if they understood how to use the command line.

* What role could you play in interupting microagressions for others?

I could actively say, "Microaggression!" and bring up this understanding with others and how it makes others feel.

# M2 & M3 Gear Up: Being an Ally

How could you be an ally in this situation? If you are a member of the targeted group, how would you want an ally to respond in this situation? What effect would it have to ignore the situation?

Scenario 1

A group of Turing students are planning to walk in the Pride parade this summer and has opened the invitation to all students. While working on your project, one of your team member says that they wish all the talk about gay pride would be over and that it is a distraction to what we are all trying to do here at Turing.

I could be an ally in this situation by speaking to the other person and helping them acknowledge that the learning that we do at Turing is more than just learning to code. It is about being a better person who acknowledges the struggles that other people face every day. I would want an ally to respond by letting them know that one weekend a year for pride fest is not a hard thing to do and that it helps support a community that is continually harrassed around the world. I would think that if I ignored the situation, I would probably come off as a person who is not an ally but a bystander.

Scenario 2

You know there are several people in your cohort who don't drink, but come Thursday, most of your friends want to go to a bar down the street. It's someone's birthday today, so your cohort's "social coordinator" invites everyone out, but you know there are several people who won't be comfortable being at a bar.

This one is conflicting. I would probably accept the social norm of drinking after work or school and let this happen. Even though I would personally not be offended, perhaps excluding people like this goes a long way towards alienating certain groups. I think perhaps it would be better if I offered to go to a place where they also serve good food.

Scenario 3

One of your friends is talking about one of the Joan Clarke events for women students that they attended. A student in your cohort, who does not identify as a woman, says that it is unfair that such exclusive groups exist. They would like to be able to take part in those group's events as well.

As an ally, I would like to point out that it would be great for people who often are excluded to have their own groups. This is important as a social support for people who feel "alone" at times. However, after reading the speech by Emma Watson, I think it is important to discuss the role of individuals who identefy as men, and what that role is in helping women attain gender equality. I think to ignore this, would be to ally myself against women.

#Fake News

This was a good gearup session. I enjoyed talking about fake news, satire, and information in general. I think as a developer, I want to stand by
my moral principles and admit that I have some power in this. It use to be that newspapers, journals, and magazines were the  ones creating the content.
This content was filtered out. The expense of writing something or putting up an ad prevented a peasant from spreading falsehoods. Today, there are
potentially billions of content writers, and no filters. With that in mind, we can only hope to programmatically fix this problem.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* I gave a lightning talk on JWTs and how it can be used in the front and back end in my posse. I hope that helps someone solve a problem.

#### **Posse**
  >* We did some coding challenges, gave a couple of lightning talks and got to know each other.
  >* Our posse experience was okay. I think I'll take a bigger role and making it better for students that are new to Turing.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I somehow helped a number of mod 2 students with their projects. I say somehow because I don't feel like I contributed much but they were happy!
