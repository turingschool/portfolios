# Bao Nguyen - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing with several months of coding experience and learning programming on my own so my focus was to improve my
fundamentals in programming, git workflow, as well as using a Unix based system for the first time! I thoroughly enjoyed
my time in Mod 1. I think there are always areas of improvement, but I think I did fairly well and Mod 1 proved to be quite
a challenge. I thought most of the challenges were easy, but the projects really pushed me. I learned a lot and found that I
gained a lot in terms of productivity and focus.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Ben Jacobs:**

Hi Ben,

I enjoyed working with you. I think your enthusiasm for solving problems is a great asset. Though however challenging the project was, you work very hard and you care clearly determined to be as good of a software developer as anyone can be. I am very impressed with how much you have learned in just a few short weeks.

As for future pairings, I think it would be great if you could slow down and work through the problem domain more before jumping into code (same applies to me!) because it is certainly not your knowledge of Ruby that is slowing you down.

Cheers, Bao

**Feedback from Ben Jacobs:**

First, I want to thank you for being an excellent partner. In my opinion it was your higher standards that propelled us to make this project better at every iteration. Your ideas about how to better utilize objects to pass the necessary information around our code made all the difference and I think that architecture it was enabled us to score so highly. I appreciate your patience with my "fast-talking, high-energy, don't always think it out before I type" -ness. Thank you for slowing me down and keeping me from saving all the refactoring for the last day. I would have liked to know how you were feeling more of the time so I could have potentially adjusted my interactions. I say this mainly because the most contention we had during the project was when I misinterpreted your comments as criticism. I also think you could try to frame your comments about work that has already been done in a more positive way, even if your intention is to push for something better. Ultimately I most appreciate your attitude toward pairing. I know it was a struggle for both of us to relinquish the control of programming solo, but you came at it with an attitude of openness and acceptance that made it easier to return in kind. Thank you.

#### Project 2 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for William Thomas:**
Hi Will,

I think working with you has been great. I think the last ten days have been pretty hard with the project, but it has
not been stressful at all. I think problem solving has been good with you and I think we move at a pretty good pace. I also
think we had some good off-topic conversations.

I think strengths that you have include: being personable and easy to talk to, good at listening. Also, I think this is
a matter of style ~ I like that you are receptive to slowly going through a problem and undestanding it rather than throwing
code at a wall and hoping it sticks.

Room for improvement: Now that I think about it, I remembered that you wanted to "git" better at the git workflow. I hope we accomplished that but I think we both could spend more a time fixing our git workflow problem so that we could do more
divide and conquer coding in the future. I felt like we were stuck on "driver/navigator" because our code didn't replicate
properly. So maybe we both need to tackle a git tutorial during our break?

Cheers,
Bao

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

Several months before I came to Turing, I probably had about a 80-90% fixed mindset. When I started learning programming on
my own, I found that the mindset was holding me back. I often hit a wall and started to think that I was not able to learn
and be successful in this field. Some time afterward, I remembered something about sports psychology. I started reading
personal development books and I found that my mindset began to change. This gear up is a great continuation of my 
personal development. I find that I am much happier now, with a more resilient mind. In turn, my performance has also 
improved (in terms of programming).

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

This was not the first time I saw this video. I saw it for the first time several months ago when I was looking for talks to 
motivate my programming. Today, I do my best to get up and get going so that I can save my cognitive stores for the most
difficult task for the day. I enjoy the programming in the morning, and I find that my mind is always fresh from 7 - 11am. I 
also am on the look out for things that create cognitive leaks. I 'automate' as much decision making as I can, as even those
can start to drain my ability to think and reason.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs Extrovert

I definitely consider myself an introvert. I do enjoy being around people and I am bored when I am by myself for too long.
However, I get my energy from being alone. That is a challenge when it comes to pair programming. I feel that I am only able
to pair for a few hours before I need to recharge with my own thoughts. This can also work out by programming for a little bit
on my own during the project, and sharing it later.

#### Session 4: Strengths and Storytelling

This is definitely a weakspot for me. I am not a great storyteller and I understand the importance of it. I will continue to
work on my 'story' so that people have a interest and understand why I want to be a software engineer. There are several
aspects to that story but it all comes from my experience for the last 10 years. Working long hours, low pay, and not finding
the work flexibility to enjoy life outside of work has all driven me to this moment.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

This is my favorite gear up of the mod. I have not watched the video before but I understand the challenges that face women
in the tech industry. I certainly don't think that men have the inate ability to be better at engineering and I don't
like the "boys club" culture that exists in workplaces like Uber. I think that diversity and women in the engineering teams,
will make for a better product/ result. I think going forward, I will do my best to ensure that women get equal offers for
not only work, but pay as well. I do strive to become a senior engineer in just the next two years, and I will leverage my
position to debug the gender problem in tech.

### Community Participation

I went to a few different spikes to find something to like. I enjoy the Woz Poz because I like learning more about data
structures and algorithms. I also attended Josh Thompson's spike on natural networking, which I found to be awesome. I hope to
start meeting people in the tech industry, starting in these next few weeks which will help my job hunt later in the year. Lastly, I do my best to join my cohort mates and a few others in the Turing community (such as the TAAAP dinner) because it is
awesome to have this community.
