# TOM SOUCIE - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to go from having solid Ruby skills to being able to use
Ruby to actually build tools to view and store data. The power of utilizing data and the Internet of Things is really fascinating to me, so understanding more about how this functions and how I can build tools for this is an exciting experience. As I go forward and continue to improve skills, I want to branch out to the IOT if possible and continue growing and developing my technical and professional skills.

This module was a really good learning experience for how much work it really takes to be successful at Turing. I was able to get a great intro to Module 1 through Mike Dao's Second Shift program, which allowed me to be successful right away. Module 2 started off with all brand new topics for me, so from the start I have always felt behind. The only way I was able to keep afloat in the class was through countless hours of work, and I would try to make myself in the building for at least 12 hours a day during the week. I want to keep up this habit and continue improving my ability to work and learn for sustained periods of time.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

While I wasn't able to complete the functionality I wanted to on Travelogue, I want to take the intermission time to go back through this and apply all the skills and lessons learned in the Little Shop project. All the repetitions from the rest of the module and especially all the work done on Little shop has helped me get more comfortable putting applications together, and now I have a lot more troubleshooting skills to keep me moving forward.

#### Travelogue (Rails Mini Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TomSoucie/travelogue)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project
)

The design intent of the Travelogue app is to capture ideas for fun trips. The trips can be selected based on duration (the "category" of the trip) and I want to be able to allow users to post images. The thought here is if someone sees a cool place they'd like to visit, they select image(s) of the site and store for review later. Then users can review all there travel ideas and easily develop a trip for a given time period.

I still need to build out the photo functionality and styling, but this is where I struggled the most, but also got the most practice during Little Shop.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The projects in this Module were a challenge, but fun and rewarding because we were actually building a visible product we could show off and conceivably someone could find useful. I know this is just the first step, and I am super motivated to keep grinding and learning and improving my web development skills.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TomSoucie/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

This was a "first" kind of project in a few ways. First, it was the largest group I've worked in at Turing, and the project was based on Sinatra/Activerecord. The large group and complex project required extensive planning and use of project management tools to track tasks and ensure we were getting all tasks completed.

We started using a Waffleboard integrated with our Github repo, which turned out to be a great tool. Late in the project (last night we were working on it) we had a slight miscommunication on our team that resulted in a lot of work that had to get fixed / code that needed reworked to resolve errors. As a group we came together after the fact and parsed out how we could avoid this kind of issue in the future by folling our waffle or tasks list closely. Overall it turned out to be a great learning experience for a large project.

* **1: Functional Expectations** -> 2: Application has some small missing base functionality
* **2: ActiveRecord** -> 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* **3: User Experience and Conventions** -> 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs.
* **4: Code Organization/Quality** -> 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file
* **5: Testing** -> 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* **6: Working Collaboratively** -> 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Little shop was a great project on a great team. It was really fun to see the project come together from our idea to an actual functioning application. I learned a ton about getting content on a browser, and dove into HAML. I want to continue working on my styling ability and understanding of how common programs interact (FactoryGirl, Paperclip, S3/Cloud storage systems).

* [Graded Rubric](https://gist.github.com/TomSoucie/4f133b138eb3b61a0c711eb684e3c9c0)

* **1: Feature Completeness** -> 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
* **2: Views** -> 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
* **3: Controllers** -> 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

## D: Professional Skills

As I continue to develop my technical skills, I'm starting to appreciate all the different career and professional development services Turing offers. As I move up in modules I want to continue to growing in professional skills and take advantage of the PD and career services Turing offers.

### Gear Up
#### Cold Outreach - Week 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

The mentor (or alum) I contacted was Ernie Miller. Ernie didn't originally respond for over a week, but then when I got back to him to set up a call we still haven't found a suitable time. I'll continue to be open for his response but I want to find a local mentor in the mean time as well.

At this point, I have not had any meaningful contact so I don't think it has helped. But I see other people at within our Mod have great experiences with mentors so I want to continue to try and find someone to work with as a mentor. I definitely see how a mentor is helpful within the development industry, but right now it's tough to find the time to seek one out.

#### Feedback II - Week 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

Each of us individually reflected on our experience, and I thought about the feedback we've shared with each other as we've worked through the project, and tried to think of any additional feedback I have yet to share. We met as a group for face to face communication.

Conversation was productive, team agreed to utilize waffle more and will discuss specific action items at our daily team meeting. As we've worked collaboratively we've had to give/receive a lot of feedback, all of which I'd say was productive, likely due to being in person. When team members have had issues the team comes together to work to solve the issue, with the focus being on the solution on not the person's ability or preferences. As a team I think we could improve explaining / discussing ideas and the best path forward when there's multiple ways to solve a problem. As a team we could also improve are use of waffle and really break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks.

#### Tragedy of the Commons - Week 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I was out sick this Friday but read through this markdown while at home. This was content we went over in Module 1 but it was a good reminder how the "status quo" will stay the same unless there's countering force on the issue. Playing with the polygon was a cool visual that illustrates some very basic human nature, and how we need to actively adjust and change to make the world a better place with less suffering for all.

#### Feedback III - Week 4

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_iii.md)

Much of my feedback is positive for collaboration, availability, and characteristics that indicate I can work well with others. I've gotten good feedback that I share the driver/navigator responsibilities well, and know when to take a break when we hit a wall. My strengths of learner and connectedness were pretty obvious in the feedback, I want to continue using these strengths and others to continue being an effective team member. One instance of feedback listed I was passive at times, which indicates that I need to elaborate and push for new and better solutions.

#### Mod4 Led Gear Up - Week 5

The Mod4 led Gear Up was a fun, organic session that had some wide ranging view points. Unconditional / Universal Basic Income will be increasingly important in the future as more and more jobs are eliminated due to automation. This should continue to increase the overall prosperity, resources and abundance of large corporations but will eliminated jobs for most people (up to 45% of all jobs).

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The Turing community is one of the most important components of the educational system, so I wanted to contribute more this module. I had wanted to get involved with the Turing podcast, but due to the struggles I faced early on in the Mod, I decided to focus as much of my time as possible on studying and getting through the module. Even though I was not able to support the podcast, I did attend all Armstrong spikes, except for a Friday Spike for Factory Girl which I subbed in. Going forward I want to continue being a part of Armstrong, and hopefully get more involved and use Armstrong posse to give back to Turing.
