# Sarah Kirk - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This mod I really focused on balance. Balance for being a good developer, balance
for my academic life versus my personal life, and balance in terms of my physical
health. I learned when to turn in for the night but I also learned to get up
earlier to get a head start on things. I faced some challenges but overall I feel like I have really excelled this mod in terms of my learning.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module time assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There were a lot of small projects this mod. I really enjoyed building out idea
box and really taking charge of my own small project. Although rails was a bit of a foreign beast at first ir really started to click for me when I began experimenteing with my own project.

#### Ideas Box

* [GitHub URL](https://https://github.com/sarahdactyl71/ideas_box)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

Description: Letâ€™s create an app to record your ideas. Host your app live on Heroku. Users can create, edit/update, show, and destroy only their own ideas.

Take Away: I learned quite a bit from this project, and although I didn't quite finish, it was still
a worthwhile experience. I had large errors with my database that took two days to debug with several pairs of eyes to solve. This project really set me up for bike share.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These group projects took a lot of communication, patience, and determination. They have taught me a lot about collaboration aside from sheer programming skills. I learned about how I work best in a group and what my limitations are. I also learned quite a bit about myself in terms of what I need to feel like I am contributing. It was also great to see a lot of other people's learning styles.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

(In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.)

(great sad paths! with user-facing error messages!
API and google maps extensions
controllers are slim, minimal logic
templates look great for formatting and not having logic
UX is snazzy
google charts!
really impressive models with logic and DRY extraction
could DRY up testing)

## D: Professional Skills
Most of the professional skills we developed this mod were about personal interaction centering around impactful feedback. They were primarily focused on team building and how we, as individuals, work in teams. We identified what our strengths are and how those played into team dynamics. In terms of my professional development, upon reflection I realized that I wasn't as outspoken in teams, a hard turn from other points in my life. Again, looking back at the notion of balance, this was something I want to work on moving forward; the balance between taking a backseat and driving. I have also taken to being mindful and working toward active listening.

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

I think its so incredibly important to have empathy in almost all life scenarios. Not only does it lead to better working teams, but to better individuals. There is so much that you don't know about a person and having empathy is a great tool for understanding your peer. I enjoyed this gear up because although I already considered myself a pretty empathetic person, I still learned quite a bit

#### Parable of the Polygon/Automation

I remember this gear up being about snakes instead of polygons. This gear up reminded me a lot of the book "Blink" by Malcom Gladwell and the internal biases that haunt us all. I think its very important to stop yourself from getting trapped into an assumption loop about someone or something. It is important to identify that thinking process because the sooner you see it the easier it is to change direction with your thoughts.

#### Dangers of a Single Story

I had heard of this ted talk from a friend of mine, and decided to go to the gear up. It tied in quite nicely with the other gear ups this mod because it was about asking more that just the single story you are given about something. Don't make assumptions based on a single story that you have heard your entire life. Again, it goes back to identifying these though processes so that you may expand your knowledge to more that one story.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did my best to participate in gear ups, especially those put on by my friends. I worked at fostering a sense of camaraderie in my cohort as well as across other cohorts. I have met with several mentors outside of Turing to discuss jobs and company culture. Every recycling bin I have passed in which I have seen waste mistakes I have corrected. I have done my best to keep the kitchen clean to ease the burden of stressed out Mod 1 students.
