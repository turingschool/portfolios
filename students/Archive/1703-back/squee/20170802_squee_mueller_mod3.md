## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this mod started out rather different than it ended. I wanted to spend the mod creating and stretching myself. I wanted to challenge myself to be more creative. Very shortly into the mod, I discovered that I wasn't doing the best job of taking care of myself. My focus changed from making the most of my coding to taking care of my health. I started taking the morning off to run or workout or be by myself.

By the end of the mod, I noticed a dramatic shift in my mood and my ability to deal with the stress of Turing. I also started understanding the lessons we were taught faster and I had more inclination to try things I wasn't comfortable with. While it seems counter productive to back off when it feels like you're struggling, it paid off for me. I'm glad I had the refocus that I did.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
  **[My Project](https://github.com/squeemishly/apicuriouser)**
>* Use the Github api to recreate the website from scratch.
>* I have struggled with reading documentation my whole life. Once I have an understanding of a topic, I can read documentation and understand what is going on. I feel like this project started me down the path of pushing through reading docs and trying things until I had a better understanding of how to solve the problem.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> **[My Project]()*https://github.com/squeemishly/rales_engine**
>* Build an API that uses a ton of SQL.
>* I learned how to build an API and how to dig into SQL until I had a solution that I wanted.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/squeemishly/cloney-island)**
>* Create a website that is based on an already existing website.
>* This project was huge. The scope of it wasn't intimidating, but the scope of the problems I didn't know how to solve was. I found myself paralyzed at the beginning of one problem, worried that I wouldn't be able to find a solution. I wasn't sure where to begin because I didn't know if what I would write would create further problems later. I learned 2 things from this:
1. Write what you know. There's always some aspect of a problem you already have a grasp on. Start there and see if you can find solutions as the code starts taking shape.
2. You will never solve the problem until you start. I actually ended up being able to overcome each of the hurdles I anticipated for myself as I came across them. None of them were easy. In fact, one of them I was still working on 2 weeks after the project was turned in. But I solved them. ;)

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/squeemishly/dark_clout)**
>* Take someone else's cloned website and add new features.
>* Inheriting someone's technical debt has it's challenges, but it also has it's rewards. I loved getting to see how other people solved problems. I loved getting to see techniques in writing code that I'd never been exposed to before. It was wonderful to have exposure to products of thought that I don't often get to see in my own cohort. I want to read more code from more people so I can learn the tools they use to solve problems.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microaggressions](
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
The small things really matter. We live in a culture that systemically marginalizes the experiences of people who don't fit in with the main stream. And that's almost everyone. POC, women, LGBT, people without enough money, people without enough education, people with mental illness, people ... You get the idea...
Microaggressions are the small slights that add up over time, slights that generally single you out for your otherness, remind you that you are not what we consider the pinnacle of society. While any one of the microaggressions committed against a marginalized person may only elicit an eye roll, they add up over time. It's not just one microaggression. It's the continuum of microaggressions that create the hostile space for people just trying to live their lives.

> [Being an Ally]( https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)
If you see something, say something. It's become a slogan for anti-terrorism. But that slogan could be more reflective. Inside the United States, marginalized peoples face their own terrorism every day. Whether it's racist epithets or people feeling entitled to touch you when they shouldn't. As a single voice trying to stand up for yourself, you are unlikely to make much headway in influencing the actions of those who would prioritize their own world view and desires above yours. When another voice joins you, particularly a voice of a similar class as the oppressor, you might start to witness a shift in behavior. If you see something, say something. Lend your voice to make life more pleasant for someone else. There is no higher goal.

> This one gear-up trick will help you win an election!
To filter or not to filter. Lies, misleading statements, partial truths. They all pervade our news outlets. They fill our facebook feeds. They are confusing, partially because, in many cases, people want to believe them. So do we hold our news sources responsible for filtering out fallacious content?
While some may look at newspapers in the past and say that in the good old days newspapers were responsible for filtering content so todays news sources have the same responsibility, I disagree. I think it's irresponsible for people to create that content to begin with, but with the changes in technology, there isn't a good way to filter out false and potentially damaging stories. I think the greater responsibility that we have is to be better about educating our populace to think through the content they read or hear. Learn to question, rather than just blindly believe because you want to.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I gave a lightning talk about Imposters Syndrome and marketed the Imposters Lunch.

#### **Posse**
  >* I met with my posse weekly to hangout and take a moment away from the grind of the Turing experience. I worked with all 3 of the mod 1 students in my posse to introduce them to resources available to them in Turing.
  >* Working with the mod 1 students
  >* I think having sympathy for people who are in an earlier point in their careers is crucial to being a good programmer. Welcoming the new folks and making them feel safe in asking the questions they have is an art.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I ran the weekly Imposters lunch. We talked with students about their struggles in Turing and helped them find outlets for their frustration and support for their questions.
