# squee mueller - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn more about development while further connecting with the Turing Community.
I also really wanted to find out if it was possible for me to show the same motivation when working on my own as I do when working in a group.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

### 5. Testing

* **4: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development effectively**



## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Work Stretcher)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/work-stretcher)
* [Original Assignment](
http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

(description)
Learn about rails routes and navigation while making a personal app of my choice. I chose to create an app that offers stretches people can do at their desks at work. It limits returns by body parts and allows people to favorite stretches they like best. There's also a notes feild for them to make notes on what works best for them.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (Bike Share)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

(evaluation comments)
* controller methods are slim
* muppets gif was fun
* a lot of Ruby enums slowing down some queries
* great use of waffle/gitflow
* navigation and flow of app is great from UX perspective, lagtime on views is what stops UX from being client ready and exceptional

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills base expectations


2. ActiveRecord
3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.


3. User Experience and Conventions
3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.


4. Code Organization/Quality
3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.


5. Testing
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data


6. Working Collaboratively
4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.


#### (Little Shop)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Benja-Ross/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

(description)
In this project we used Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

- UX is fantastic - super clean, usable, well designed
- New items not creating category association
- Factories look fantastic
- All feature tests were created before starting project which really drove whole site production
- stylesheets look amazing - component based, used Sass tools, etc
- views made good use of partials


### 1. Feature Completeness

* **3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented**


### 2. Views

* **4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present**


### 3. Controllers

* **3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts**


### 4. Models

* **4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features**


### 5. Testing

* **4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels**


### 6. Usability

* **4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers**


### 7. Workflow

* **3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.**



## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I loved the Vi Hart site that this Gear Up was centered around. My group spent a fair amount of time talking about how seemingly innocuous preferences (like being around people with a similar education level as you) can have much larger world-wide impacts. We spent a lot of time talking about how we could be better advocates for marginalized people in the world. I walked away with more fire to do right by the world and bring the whole world up with me.


#### (Lending Priviledge)

Mod 4 led this Gear Up, where we talked about the experience of priviledge and how we find ways to help people in our community to even the playing field.  I loved getting to talk to my group of people and seeing their different reactions to overt and more subtle sexism and racism. I came away from the session feeling more confident in my ability to directly address people's behavior when they are being inappropriate.

#### Project Management strategies

We used waffle in both of my group projects this mod. While I think that waffle is a little clunky for getting started (we mostly listed the tests we needed to write and then a second card for getting each test to pass), it ended up being a really good communication tool. We were able to tell each other what we were working on in our project without having to stop what we were doing. We were also able to add todos back into the waffle board so we didn't have to stop what we were working on in the moment to address another problem.

#### Mentor & Alumni outreach

I've already formed several connections with developers in Denver. I have one mentor I meet with every other week and a couple other people I chat with on slack. I intend to have coffee with both of them during this upcoming two week break to get their thoughts on job search strategies.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I led the Imposters Lunch every Wednesday for this mod. I loved getting to spend more time with people who weren't just mod2 BE. I don't know that this experience has helped me grow as a professional, but it did connect me with some awesome people in the school. I've loved getting to support people on days that they struggled and help them find victories in what they struggled with.


### Feedback

Most of the feedback I've gotten has been really positive. I think the hardest feedback that I've received has been that my incessant positivity comes across as having too much confidence. That I don't find school challenging and that I'm rubbing that in the faces of the people around me. I'm not really sure how to tone down my positivity, so I've resorted to not talking as much about how much I'm enjoying the challenges here.
