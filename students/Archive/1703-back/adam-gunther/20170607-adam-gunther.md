## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work included Blogger, MixMaster, Job Tracker, and a Gamified Blog. I gained solid reps with Blogger and MixMaster, which prepared me for Job Tracker. My Rails Mini Project was a gamified blog in which users could earn clout by participating on the platform (commenting, liking/disliking content, others liking their content). Users were rewarded with increased permissions/authorization for earning clout.

#### Rails Mini Project - Gamify Blog

The rails mini project was a gamified blog in which users could earn clout by participating on the platform (commenting, liking/disliking content, others liking their content). Users were rewarded with increased permissions/authorization for earning clout. Next step is to add like/dislike button functionality.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group Projects consisted of Bike Share and Little Shop. Bike Share is a Sinatra RESTful app that consumes data through CSVs and Web Forms and provide a dashboard of analysis. Little Shop is a fully-functioning ecommerce platform.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamgunther1/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

This application collects data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. This application provides a number of user dashboards with analysis of trends in bike share usage.

##### Comments
  - controller methods are slim
  - muppets gif was fun
  - a lot of Ruby enums slowing down some queries
  - great use of waffle/gitflow
  - navigation and flow of app is great from UX perspective, lagtime on views is what stops UX from being client ready and exceptional

### Gear Up
#### Python or Viper

In this gear up an alumn spoke about empathy and segregation in the workplace. We need to build a welcoming community and environment and actively encourage diversity. It's important to empower others.

#### Parable of the Polygon

This was a fascinating gear up that used a web application to demonstrate the different effect of being open to diversity versus actually pursuing it. When people are open to diversity, not much change actually occurs, because people aren't actively pursing change.


 #### Feedback III

 * [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_two/feedback_iii)

 We filled out the Johari window which show us how other people view us versus how we see ourselves. I really enjoyed this, discovering where I was accurate and where my blind spots are. It's important to know how are we seen by others and how I view myself..

 #### Universal Basic Income

 This was a student led gear up focusing on the positive and negatives of a universal basic income. The video brought to light how little experimentation has been done around the effectiveness of UBI. The group discussions were fascinating to see how the way policies can be implemented could really go both ways - more socialistic or capitalistic.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I paired with mod1 students a few times which was a cool experience to see where we started and to provide lessons learned and approaches I've found valuable. I was involved in the Armstrong posse focusing on blockchain and we even put together an event to meet alumni and people working in blockchain.
