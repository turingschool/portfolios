# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

My focus on this inning has been Javascript. I want to market myself as a full stack developer and Javascript is the frontend framework. I want to gain expertise in AngularJS and React.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (**pass**) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The assessment was very straight forward, but it gave me a good chance to refactor, make sure I was using es6 consistenly. 


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Fun assignnment. I enjoyed making the word cloud.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I took the features one step at a time.



## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The biggest technical challenge was deploying both apps the night before the deadline and running into a lot of errors.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Many problems arose and only some were able to be dealt with. I took the errors one at a time, read through the logs carefully and researched errors and solutions.


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I enjoyed manipulating and traversing the DOM, developing seperate frontend and backend applications, and writing a completely javascript app.


* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I learned JQuery, Javascript, and more about CORS.


* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I would deploy early and often.


* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was tough, but helpful working through something together that neither of us knew much about.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

MEAN stack


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I want to market myself as adaptable to new technologies, so taking on an entirely new stack was a challenge I wanted to take on.


* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I read documentation thoroughly and went through tutorials. It took a lot of experimentation with code.


* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I learned a lot. I'm a big fan of MongoDB and Express together. I learned the benefits of frontend frameworks. I learned to work through lots of new errors and tackle them one by one.


## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I have received lots of great feedback from fellow classmates regarding the job hunt and what has worked well for them. The class has been supportive of each other and sharing what has worked and what hasn't.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

Planning the Not So Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** was a great process to develop a discussion based class that encourages each student to make more time for what they love and to remove distractions, annoyances, and obligations from their lives. Planning the session was easy with such a great group and we were prepared with worksheets and well-time content delivery. Enjoyed hearing from all of the class on how they'd like to declutter their lives.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I was always make myself available to pair with other students. A couple of students and myself also put together a couple job tours to various companies for the entire class to learn about the company and what life as a developer can be like.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Grit, Process, and Creativity.
