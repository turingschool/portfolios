# ADAM GUNTHER - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with a focus to learn how to build powerful, robust web applications. I've had experience with HTML, CSS, JQuery, but lacked the skill to customize the backend of websites. I've been very intrigued by the development of the blockchain and attended all armstrong spikes that focused on the blockchain and the emerging Ethereum technology built on the blockchain.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Padraic O'Neill):

**Feedback for Padraic O'Neill:**

> Overall, the pairing went smoothly. We took on the driver/navigator role which worked well, because we found ourselves to be at the same level of skill and found it was helpful for us to articulate our thought process to each other. It was easy to get along with each other, even during struggles. It was a nice way to relieve fatigue to switch from figuring out how it should be coded to/from how it should be approached. We were each aware we had a lot to learn to get the project completed, but welcomed the challenge positively, and certainly learned a lot. Upon retro, we were very much on the same page as far as problems/opportunities for improvement.  We failed to adhere to the rubric/scaffolding which caused lots of refactoring down the road, which made us lose sight of the full scope of the project. We did not sketch/diagram/pseudocode or discuss our overall approach once we started and began to abandon TDD when it became crunch time. Moving forward, itâ€™s clear a working program needs to be done two days before the due date to save a day for refactoring. The pairing was worthwhile, each member did their part, and when the struggle was real, each of us came through with creative solutions.

**Feedback from Padraic O'Neill:**

> Hi Adam,

I'm grateful to have had my first pairing project with you. I felt like we were often on the same level as far as experience and skills, but more importantly in terms of our dispositions and ability to communicate. These factors made the experience smooth and productive. There were times when I became frustrated with the code and its unwillingness to do what we wanted, and I could tell that you picked up on that. Part of that frustration was that we were running out of time. In retrospect, I would have preferred if we'd worked on Sunday, but I followed your lead and agreed to take Sunday off. We probably would have made a lot of progress that day and that may have resulted in us finishing the project before the wee hours of the morning. I'd suggest trying to use the weekends to be as productive as possible since there is less pressure, and it's usually the beginning of the project. Instead of sharing in my frustration you were able to forge ahead and get us to the next level, when we then could share a little victory. Your fortitude was a big part of our success as a team.

#### Project 2 (Alex Koch):

**Feedback for Alex Koch:**

> This project was a success. We struggled hard in the beginning to conceptualize how to approach the project and the interaction patterns between objects. This struggle allowed us to breeze through later iterations because we had a solid structure to build off. We put in solid amounts of work time to get the project done well ahead of time allowing us to refactor. Our work styles were compatible. We used driver/navigator until we got stumped, and went solo to problem solve until one of us figured it out, usually collaboratively discussing issues throughout. We each went through periods of confusion and the other was able to explain the approach, bring the other up to speed, and keep the project moving forward together. My actionable criticism would be for you to ask others for help after struggling for more than 30 minutes because a fresh pair of eyes usually cuts out hours of struggle. Your understanding of ORM and databases certainly got us started and in a good place in the initial iterations when I was confused by the spec. Your understanding was an essential part of the success of our project.

**Feedback from Alex Koch:**

> -- I had a really great project with Adam, we worked really well together and we rarely ran into any issues. We were both really focused on getting everything done. I felt that we communicated really well and contributed equally. He was really open to trying all my ideas. I really liked how he helped push me towards TDD more than I would have on my own. It was really helpful and helped us get a better mark overall.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset was an essential lesson for our time at Turing and in our careers as developers. Learning about the perspective of looking at how far you've come or how much your're learning opposed to how much you don't know and how much others already know is crucial to success. This leads to meaningful transformation and growth.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

Getting Better at Difficult Things was a insightful lesson on how to overcome challenges and tackle big problems. My main take aways were the idea of reducing one's cognitive load to have more endurance and strategy and breaking down big problems into small actionable steps of progress.

#### Session 3: Working Styles

Working Styles was an interesting discussion on understanding how others communicate and prefer different working styles. In development, pair programming is an integral part, so laying out expectations and disucssing how someone likes to work and communicate helps improve the project flow and successful outcome.

#### Session 4: Strengths and Storytelling

Strengths and Storytelling really emphasized the importance of crafting one's identity and how to present one's strengths through storytelling. Being able to craft an image of oneself is important in positioning one's career. I did not like trying to relate it to the strengthsfinder, but appreciate the importance of awareness of one's strengths and to highlight them.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

Debugging the Gender Gap was a powerful moving which motivated a powerful discussion. It was a great opportunity to learn more about the industry, the necessary advocacy one needs to bring to the workplace on a daily basis, and to understand what individuals and groups in our community go through and how to take actionable steps for progress.

### Community Participation

I am still getting my footing here at Turing and figuring out how to manage my time with the overwhelming amount of work. The extent of my community participation has revolved around asking for help and offering help when needed and attending the blockchain spike every week. I have learned to ask for help when stuck and to offer help when others are stuck, which strengthens all of our learning and understanding of topics. I setup pairing sessions with module 2 and 4 students when I was failing to grasp how to implement a topic in my code which got me through this module. The blockchain spike was a great way to meet upper-module students and learn from them. The topic was difficult but fascinating. The leaders are in the final module so it will require participation from us lower-modules to keep the spike going.
