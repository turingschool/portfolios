# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

This inning I hope to reach a point where I feel proficient in Javascript. I hope that I also return to rails for my capstone and finish Turing feeling like I have a solid grasp on the framework that the program was largely focused on. I also want to complete the next iteration of my Climate Analog application so that I can think about taking that project to its next phase which will be beta testing. 

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

My biggest technical challenge is code organization. I feel that I am able to create everything that I've set my mind to. I think that it is largely a matter of always rushing through the Turing curriculum, I haven't given refactoring its due. I look forward to refactoring all of my pinned projects on Github just as soon as I'm out of here. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I enjoy thinking about how the architecture of an application should work, and then trying to tackle it and watching those red tests turn green once again. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I think I already answered this question, but to tack on more, I think that honing a deeper understanding of Ruby and Rails fundamentals, reading about the principles laid down by Sandi Mentz, and reflecting on the 4 priniciples of object oriented programming allow one to approach a major refactor with the right mindset. 

* What did you learn?

Patience. 

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Becoming comfortable in the Javascript landscape was initially a large hurdle. The unspecific error messages that are so common in Javascript at first presented a frustrating learning obstacle. I was also confused by DOM traversal inititially. I still find writing JavaScript in a Object Oriented Pattern, testing Javascript, and selecting a specific HTML node with jQuery are difficult. 

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

After a few days of repetition working with Javascript, I started to recognize many of the code patterns that I had learned working with Ruby and Rails. Once I worked through several frustrating bugs specifically, I started to find my footing and understand what had been holding me up prior. Becoming more fluent at using Javascript's debugger in the browser also helped me significantly to increase my overall understanding of what was going on in my code. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Honestly I really enjoyed both the fronted and the node backend. I felt that building an API in node was very interesting. Doing all of the things we've become so familiar with in Rails, but in a different framework was challenging yet rewarding. I feel the process solidified some of the pattern thinking that I've developed. Creating migrations, chasing down errors with migrations, handrolling routes and writing raw sql were all challenging but in the end reinforced my understandings. 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I became very comfortable and familiar with creating a database for Node.js. Also, in an unfortunate rabbit hole that I decended into while trying to push our node to production, I learned a lot about that process. I also feel that I became 100 x more competent in HTML and Javascript in general. I feel like I can dynamically manipulate webpages, which is a new skillset entirely for me. 

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I don't write JavaScript in an OOP approach. I didn't spend a lot of time refactoring this project which would have helped me get some reps in this regard. In my next Javascript frontend project, this will be my main focus. 

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was an interesting experience. The first few days we were both equally lost. I started to gain my footing and found myself teaching concepts right as I was learning them. It was very helpful for solidifying. 

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

The statistical component of the aligning user climate profiles with a strategy's climate profile was exceedingly complex. Parsing the data out of sheer chaos, then creating a data format that I could run conditionals against, then keeping in mind that I'd like to eventually be able to update that data in a meaningful way when users outside of its paramaters verify the project, made it a major challenge. It was an exercise in architectural and cognitive organization.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I started off by breaking every component that I possibly could out into its own object. It was important to isolate pieces of complexity as much as possible so that I could focus on one thing at a time. The value of single responsibility was quite obvious. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

It was a type of complexity that I haven't yet encountered at Turing. I felt that it was a lens into what it might be like to work with complex data in a professional setting. It was exciting to see useful outcomes from data in a subject I am familiar with. 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

It's not necessarily a technical concept, but I learned about the complexity that many API's will have. It gave me a valuable framework and preparedness for what I will encounter in the professional world. I also learned quite a lot about Google's API services and the ways in which they are difficult and rewarding. I also learned a lot about ChartsJS. I really enjoy visualizing data, and I look forward to finding other tools that help me to do so. 

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I have received a lot of valuable feedback from classmates concerning the job hunt. I will continue to stay close with everyone and provide my support as well. 

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

The process was surprisingly easy. I was lucky to be in a group of kind and motivated people. The subject was also one that was easy to talk about because Artificial Intelligence/Automation are such fascinating and relevant topics. 

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I made myself available to pair with people. I didn't pair much but I feel it was valuable when I did. I also have made myself available to people in younger cohorts for support and advice in moving forward. 

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Work Ethic, Persistence, Light-heartedness
