# Benjamin Jacobs - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module 2, I wanted to build on the programming skills developed in module 1 and learn how to create web applications with Rails and Sinatra, 
specifically focusing on gaining proficiency in the use of Active Record. I also wanted to make a strong attempt to do more learning on my own 
in on subjects outside the scope of module 2, which was accomplished through my participation in Armstrong posse as
well as the completion of small(and ridiculous) rails application. Through group projects(which expanded from 2 to 4 members) I dove deeper 
into the Agile approach of managing projects and learned a great deal more about collaboration and best team practices. The series 
of tutorials and mini-projects, throughout the middle of the module, allowed for a great opportunity to stretch out and start 
playing with more advanced rails functions, such as api calls. Generally this module was a significant turning point in my journey at
Turing where I am beginning to feel like I can contribute to a real development project.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
Blogger: Created simple bloggin site as a means to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails
Mix Master: Created an application which tracks songs, artists, and playlists, implementing one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
 
Both of these projects were an effective way to get introduced to Rails, and get reps on the most common actions to
create a basic web application. I enjoyed that not only from one to the next, but within the projects themselves there
was a steady decrease in explicit instruction as a way of weaning us off the guidance and driving home core concepts. I especially
appreciated the focus on git workflow in Mix Master. It has been one of the most helpful lessons of the mod in terms of
getting that process ingrained into my personal workflow.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
Job Tracker: Starting from an existing code base, we build additional features on personal job tracking app. 
Rails Mini Project: I created a workout tracking application, incorporating basic CRUD for all workout aspects, as well as dashboard metrics and a google maps api.

Job tracker was a fantastic step toward Rails autonomy, giving me the chance to solve some of the application development puzzles
without an explicit tutorial telling me what to do. In retrospect this is where routing, forms and schema design really came into focus for me.
It is also where I took the opportunity to learn and implement HAML instead of HTML, which I believe greatly improved my efficiency.

Rails Mini Project, which for me was "Fitness Locker", was a great project in that I feel horrible about it. I think I had much grander plans in mind
than what I ended up accomplishing. Because of that, I let my test driven workflow and my git workflow fall off too often in favor of spiking around
to try to push boundaries. I believe that I learned a lot from doing the project, both from those mistakes, but also from more success with CSS, ingraining
rails concepts further, and beginning to learn the implementation of API's into rails applications. They can't all be winners.

## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share** 
We used Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record to build a site that displays and generates statistics on the San Francisco bike share system.
I worked with a fantastic group during this project. We put in a significant amount of workout and it paid off greatly. We were able
to get through the entire project, utilizing effective active record queries as well as implementing graph and API extensions. Thanks
to some extremely talented teammates, it even looked good!

**Little Shop of Orders** 
We built an e-commerce platform to in Ruby on Rails to sell accessories for your digital Avatar.
This project really summed and solidified the entire module's worth of lessons in one massive undertaking. 
Some of my favorite aspects were working with forms to accept nested attributes, utilizing helper modules,
implementing searches, and working with a three talented, creative and positive people.

## D: Professional Skills

[Professional Development Reflections](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1703-b/benjamin_philip_jacobs.md)

### Gear Up

#### Empathy

The most intriguing part of this session is the concept of accurately stating how you feeling. Not using “i fell THAT” but actually expressing a real feeling as a means of eliciting empathy and human connection during a moment of confrontation. I think making observations without judgement is a particularly difficult thing for most people, myself obviously included. But this is something I'd like to continue working on during my time here at Turing.

#### Parable of the Polygon

After this gear up, I believe that Turing's mission be to impart that the understanding that diversity is not something to be tolerated but is essential and necessary to the growth of any field, especially one as innovative as tech. It is important to remember that though the social consciousness of this concept is important and should not be overlooked, there lies at the root a deeper necessity to diversity. It leads to more creativity, stronger innovation and the quicker advancement of the field. More perspective leads to better design. Additionally, that it needs to be the prerogative of aware and open-minded people to actively seek out and demand diversity in their environments. This type of behavior can be contagious if it is in earnest. 

#### The Danger of a Single Story

This was a really great gear up put on by members of Module 4. We dove into the biases that we generate everyday in the context of creating a single story for the people we encounter, without pausing
to consider the depth and details of their lives. This is so relevant to both life in the Turing bubble as well as the development community. Though I believe that making assumptions and categorizing
people is a unconscious mental instinct to decrease cognitive load, this session brought into focus how important it is to stay cognizant of that fact and actively work against it. It can be so damaging
to believe the single story. It has left me with a more lasting impression than many other gear ups and I've been trying to internalize it in the days since.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I believe I played a role in the Turing community in two distinct ways this inning. The first being the mentor-ship of Mod1 student Ellen Cooper. After being paired together at the start of the inning, we have remained in contact and I've made a concerted effort to continue to check in with her and offer both technical and (though rarely needed) emotional/social support.

Additionally, I was an active member of Armstrong posse. There I gave a couple of technical talks on block chain technology in tandem with Chris Smith. This was both a rewarding and frustrating experience. Despite the fact that the Ethereum block chain network is constantly evolving and being on the bleeding edge of tech is an intimidating place for someone with 6months of programming experience, I found that enriching my own understanding in a self-directed way has both contributed to my peers understanding of the subject as well as boosted my efficacy for autodidacticism.
