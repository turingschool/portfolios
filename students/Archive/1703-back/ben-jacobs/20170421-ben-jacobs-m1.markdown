# Benjamin Jacobs - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one my main area of emphasis has been to develope as strong understanding of programming conventions, structures and tactics as possible. Additionally I wanted to come out of this period with a solid understanding of the Ruby language and how to use it effectively and within the bounds of Ruby convention.

From a community stand-point I also wanted to be able to meet other individuals who were coming from the same place in life and motivation as myself. In this I believe I was successful and have met many incredibly talented and intelligent people, whom I believe will be friends and collaborators long into the future.

Additionally, though I had no formal training in programming prior to Turing, I was able to dedicate substantial time and concentration to the pre-work which I believe set me
on a path of deeper understanding than some of my cohort mates. As a result I have also tried to emphasis teaching and elucidating concepts to my peers as both a form of community involvement and an addendum to my own education

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Bao Nguyen):

**Feedback for Bao Nguyen:**

First, I want to thank you for being an excellent partner. In my opinion it was your higher standards that propelled us to make this project better at every iteration. Your ideas about how to better utilize objects to pass the necessary information around our code made all the difference and I think that architecture it was enabled us to score so highly. I appreciate your patience with my "fast-talking, high-energy, don’t always think it out before I type" -ness. Thank you for slowing me down and keeping me from saving all the refactoring for the last day. I would have liked to know how you were feeling more of the time so I could have potentially adjusted my interactions. I say this mainly because the most contention we had during the project was when I misinterpreted your comments as criticism. I also think you could try to frame your comments about work that has already been done in a more positive way, even if your intention is to push for something better. Ultimately I most appreciate your attitude toward pairing. I know it was a struggle for both of us to relinquish the control of programming solo, but you came at it with an attitude of openness and acceptance that made it easier to return in kind. Thank you.

**Feedback from Bao Nguyen:**

I enjoyed working with you. I think your enthusiasm for solving problems is a great asset. Though however challenging the project was, you work very hard and you care clearly determined to be as good of a software developer as anyone can be. I am very impressed with how much you have learned in just a few short weeks. As for future pairings, I think it would be great if you could slow down and work through the problem domain more before jumping into code (same applies to me!) because it is certainly not your knowledge of Ruby that is slowing you down.

Cheers, Bao

#### Project 2 (Ben Ross):

**Feedback for Ben Ross:**

My parter was excellent to work with and a strong asset to the team. His patience, relentlessly positive attitude, upbeat demeanor, sense of humor and attention to detail kept us on track and in a great head space throughout. He was easy to schedule with and made himself available whenever and where ever it was convenient for me. He was particularly fantastic in pairing sessions tempering my speed with thoughtful design ideas and incisive questions that pushed us in the right direction. My only constructive feedback is that I wish he would have been more vocal with me about when and where he might have been feeling lost/confused/ or simply unsure of the code we were writing. I believe his reticence was probably rooted in his not wanting to “slow me down” or “slow the project down" but I would have much preferred to move slower and him to have gotten even more out of the experience. In the future I hope he can feel comfortable enough in a pairing to be more open about this, it will just make the project stronger. Overall, working with Ben was a phenomenal experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

I would say that, so far this week, my mindset has been anything but stable. If anything, this week has had me start to understand the real difference between growth and fixed mindset. It would seem that though I might have a predilection toward fixed in general, this environment has had the effect of making me take stock of that and try to adjust accordingly.

Feeling inadequate, frustrated and helpless are all reasons I believe a person can get stuck in a fixed mindset. Putting too much pressure on oneself to be excellent at everything all the time. Effectively an overly obsessive or perfectionist attitude. It really all seems to boil down to insecurity. Worrying about what others will think of you, your defenses go up and it stops you from moving into a growth mindset.

The strategies I’d like to employ are the same that I have been trying to implement. Continually ask myself where my reactions are coming from. Am I feeling defensive because I’m being attacked or am I feeling defensive because I’m scared I don’t know something. Fear in generally seems to be a great indicator of fixed mindset. I think by trying to take stock and continually re-calibrate I can start to develop growth mindset as a habit or more hard-wired reaction to stress and frustration.

I think if I can ask my peers and instructors to be patient, honest and kind with me, I will be able to make this transition successfully.


#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

Especially in this second phase of education, I have taken a very proactive approach to managing my learning process. For me this means coding drills, supplementary reading, copious note taking, self-study and an annoying amount of questions to the instructors. I would say so far these efforts have been a success. I feel like I am grasping the material and retaining the most important aspects. I assume that these could potentially break down as expectations and stress rise and time becomes a more scarce resource. I am hoping to build up a strong base so as I have less time to consciously dedicate to these practices they will be more a rote response to incoming info.

Sierra and Coates both have views on this learning process that are relevant to my current head space. Mainly the idea of managing cognitive load resonates strongly. I think my biggest take-away from this will be that very concept. I think it will be essential for me to be able to keep that under control during this process. Create a balance between skills that are moved into the “mastered" category and mainly keeping more skills in the “too hard for now” category in order to master things in an effective and scaffolded manner.

Emotional state is obviously an important indicator of how successful an educational endeavor will be. Too much frustration and there is disengagement. Too much early success and the same can happen. I think managing a middle ground where I am engaged and challenged will be the most successful.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs Extrovert

I have been successfully maintaining a growth mindset in terms of not taking failure as a sign of an inability to learn. I am consistently treating failures as an opportunity to learn something new. Although, it has been challenging to maintaining a growth mindset in my personal interactions with certain individuals. Any time I have felt defensive or challenged has been a moment where I’m probably not asking myself what the learning opportunity is.

I plan to try to bridge this gap. Limit the times when I let frustration with people turn into anger. I also plan to try to make a conscious effort to slow myself down in key moments. Not only to better communicate with others, but to listen better and attempt to glean more context in hope of drawing positive outcomes from those circumstances.

I find myself falling mostly in the middle of the spectrum. From the extroverts I heard that there is a need for open and honest communication from the introverts. Speak up, speak your mind, tell me what you need. From the introverts I heard that sometimes I’m going to need a break from the interaction to recharge. I feel like, as always, empathy and communication are the best tools to get the best work from other people and give them what they need to perform.

Because I feel as though I can fall to either side as the situation dictates(i.e. some situations cause for openness others for patient silence), I can leverage that ability to relate to people all across the spectrum. As it is becoming more and more obvious that people care more about whether they can get along with you than how skilled you are, this seems like an ideal skill to try to build on for future success.


#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

Many feelings and emotions brought me to Turing. Feeling unchallenged, obsolete, directionless, purposeless. Feeling like I was stuck in a career, in a time, in a space that I had no escape from. Turing seemed to me to be a key toward a brighter future. A direction away from a dying industry and into an exciting and thriving one. This is an engaging and growing industry filled with puzzles and problems to solve and interesting and intelligent people to work with.

I often see the world through the lens of how things work, or how do people work. What is the motivation, what is the why. If I can understand the why, then I can understand the thing or the person. I can work with them. I can help out. I can contribute. 

I value hard-work. I value kindness. I value intelligence(both learned and innate). I value empathy. I value knowledge. I think these are extremely apparent in the way I conduct myself. I hold myself to an extremely high standard of work ethic and discipline and I believe that it’s noticeable in my action. I enjoy discourse on most topics and am extremely curious which I think also demonstrates some of these values. I try to be kind and empathetic in every human interaction but I would have to speak with the people around me to make sure that is observed.


#### Session 5: Debuggind the Gender Gap

My experiences at Truing have been very different than those shared in the documentary. I’ve felt like because most people are Turing are coming from the same lack of CS background (and because the mission statement of Turing is, in itself, a self-selecting factor) the playing field is more even, more open, and relatively diverse. I say relatively because there still are fewer women, and perhaps less racial/ethnic then there could be. However, the foundation of Turing is that everyone who is here, should be here. There is no innate ability that will bring you through it, you can learn it, it’s teachable. It does not matter what background gender, race, age, or whatever you’re coming from.

I would say that my role in creating inclusive involvement is that of ‘passively lead by example…’ By that I mean I try to be the change I want to see without broadcasting an agenda. I try to treat all the people I’ve met and interact with and work with evenly and respond to them based on who they are as people and not “what” they are. After watching this documentary however, I believe that once in the tech world professionally a more active approach on this issue will be called for.

I have in fact been part of a situation similar to one described in the film. I was having a conversation with a cohort-mate where we were talking about strengths outside of what we were learning in class. She mentioned and demonstrated an impressive talent in visual aesthetic. It occurred to me that with those skills combined with here strong sense of empathy that she could be an excellent UX designer and I made a comment to that effect. Though not my intention, she felt that I, like many others in her life, had been suggesting that she'd be better at making things pretty rather than building them. Though not my intention or insinuation at all, I see how in the context of her experience I was just another guy telling here she shouldn't be doing this. I think it was an excellent moment of growth. Combined with my experience watching this film I believe I will be able to better identify these subtle moments in the future. I hope to bring that awareness to whatever professional situation I end up in. It's so easy to overlook these small moments, but they are the most important to making real change.

### Community Participation

As previously mentioned, my first module here at Turing has been primarily focused on building a strong technical foundation in programming that I will be able to build on in future mods. As a result, I did not engage in the level of community participation that I would like to in the future. I did join the Wozniak posses and thoroughly enjoyed what felt like an extra couple of hours per week of class. It also allowed me to forge relationships with some like-minded students in mod 2, which was fantastic. I do believe that on the most local level(i.e. 1703BE) I remained very engaged in the well being an understanding of as many cohort-mates as possible. From helping out with concepts and problems, to extra-curricular hangs and meet-ups. To me, this was the most important community development of the past six weeks.
