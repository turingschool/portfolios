# B4 Carl Richmond

## Area of Emphasis

I went into this inning with the focus on doing really well on my capstone. It has been the only thing I have thought about since the beginning. I was important to me that I leave Turing with a project that I could be proud of. 

## Assessment

Final outcome: Pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
My biggest challenge this inning was my capstone project and learning how to take a bunch of seemingly unrelated numbers, and make predictions out of them. 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
That I choose it myself and I choose it not knowing how or if I would be able to solve it. It pushed me to look at so many different concepts, even though most were useless for my purposes in the end. I took a piece of tech that someone else built and probably did stuff with it that they didn't design it for. 
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Grind as hard as I could for as long as I could.
* What did you learn?
I learnt so many things about statistics and how the different concepts can be applied to so many different scenarios. I also had a blast learning about React. 

## Quantified Self

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
I didn't find Quantified self to offer much of a technical challenge, besides maybe getting the code to production. It definitely solidified a lot of JS concepts though and I found it a fun project overall.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Pushing to production involved a lot of googling and re-checking our code. We had a flew sloppy spelling mistakes that were throwing some ridiculous errors. Our approach was mostly following the erorrs until there were none left. 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I am looking to learn more about dev ops, so watching and helping Alex troubleshoot was really helpful.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
I found the pairing process very natural. You work in mostly group projects from day 1 mod 1, so it's more unnatural to work alone than not at this point. 
## Capstone Project

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
How to interpret the information Watson gives you and how to deal with wild innacuracies of Watson when dealing with professional vocabulary.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I solved it by maticulously working my way through my sample data and applying any new statistical concepts I learnt to the entire data set. Through process of elimination I arrived at an approach that fit what I needed to do. 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
That I didn't know if I could or would succeed. That I was passionate about the idea. That I felt confident in my ability to do what needed to be done. 
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Pearson correlation, how to interpret regression results and everything about React.
## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
I learnt that I need to better communicate my thoughts when doing coding challenges and get more reps in with them so that I move through problems more quickly. I plan on making coding challenges my priority from day 1 of post Turing to address this issue. Even above outreach for the few two weeks.  
## Gear Up

I thought the process of trying to make the gear up interesting and engaging really interesting. Trying to choose topics that will increase participation is really hard, but it's nice to learn so many new things along the way. We consumed a lot of information in the planning phases and talked at length about which ones would interest people the most. I appreciated the fact that this experience was opportunity to practice my public speaking, which I do need practice in. It's also a nice piece of community work that I can include in a job interview. 

## Community Involvement

I did a few pairing sessions, but overall this mod I participated the least in Turing's community. With capstone, there was just no time to give to anyone else. I barely had time for the things I had immediately in front of me. 

## Going Forward

I'm going to bring my grit, work ethic and problem solving abilities to whatever job I get out of Turing. Turing taught me how to go from zero to 100 in a topic in a fairly short period of time and I want to continue doing that for the rest of my career. I want to say yes to new challenges as much as possible in the future.
