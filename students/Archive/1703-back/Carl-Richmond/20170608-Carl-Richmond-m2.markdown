## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to come out of Mod 2 being comfortable with rails and have a few projects to be proud of on my Github. I also wanted to spent some time researching topics outside of Turing.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed the individual timed assessment.
Waiting for written test results. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is my individual project for Mod2:

#### Star Wars Dating

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ACC25/star_wars_dating)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

* Description: I came up with this idea to practice database setup, user authentication, authorization, and working with multiple APIs in the same project - while having some fun along the way. The live version can be found here: https://shielded-tundra-55756.herokuapp.com/) 

*Take aways: It was really good practice in working with APIs and building a web app, as I got to see every part of it. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are my group projects for Mod2:

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ACC25/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

* Description: This application collects data through web forms and by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application provides a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

* Evaluation comments: More work needed to be put into testing and there was some logic in the controller that could have been moved. 

* Evaluation scores: 3's, except 4 in teamwork and 2 in testing.  

* Feedback: Have not received any feedback for this project. 

#### Zelda's Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ACC25/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

* Description: An e-commerce site, serving the residents of Hyrule (Zelda reference) with all the best potions and equipment. Users can create an account, add and remove items from their cart, and ultimately create an order by checking out. The live version of the site can be found at: https://nameless-sands-53448.herokuapp.com

* Evaluation comments: Refactors everywhere.

* Evaluation scores: 3s except for 4 in Git workflow. 

## D: Professional Skills

Reflections on all the Gear ups.

### Gear Up
#### Collaborative Communication

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)

I found that this session to be a good refresher on what the basic principles of Agile Development are and how they can be applied at Turing. Looking back, my first group in Bike Share did not plan or use task managers, like Waffle, and I think we were less productive as a result. The group dynamic was to split up and work independently, but we didn't plan enough for a system like that to work. We should have planned out each iteration in depth, so we always had a reference point for what work needed to be done. 

My most recent group project, Little Shop, has been the polar opposite of Bike Share. We have used Waffle exclusively for task assignment, but we have not worked independently at any point in the project. We have tackled problems as a full group the entire time. Our planning decreased the time it took to assign tasks, but our group dynamic--always working together--increased the time to accomplish those tasks. I will say working on everything together has been good for learning and understanding all the code in the project.  

#### Communication Skills for Effective Feedback Conversations

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md)

I found that this session was useful in further strenghtening how I commmunicate feedback by highlighting the need to focus on intent vs impact. Social blind spots are something I know I struggle with, so having a session that touched on that subject was good for me. I found the section on switchbacks particularly useful, as pivoting is an important skillset and it's important to practice as much as possible. 

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I found this site and session to be really informative and interesting. Playing with the polygon site was really entertaining and a great way to get the authors point accross--we have an inherent bias to be around similar people. I thought it fit well with Turing's goal of creating an inclusive environment and the need to constantly push for inclusivity. We will continue to have a 1/3 bias to group make-up until we reset what people consider to be normal and create such an inclusive space that it's wierd NOT to have a diverse group.  

#### Johari Window

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_iii.md)

The Johari Window results were interesting, but not totally surprising. There were a few ratings that I thought were a little harsh at first, but once I got over that initial reaction I thought they were warranted. Most of my group members rated me exactly the same, so I feel I can take those attributes as being fairly accurate. Comparing my self assessment with my group members, I found that they rated me as being more confident and intelligent than I rated myself. I know I can be harsh when it comes to self reflection, so I will try and take this session as a reminder to treat myself with compassion. 

#### Black Mirror

This session focused on the negatives of social media and what responsibility we as developers have in creating this new digital reality. I didn't find this session as useful as the others as it's a topic that I have already thought about and spoken about at length. I don't use 90% of the social media out there already, because I don't like it, so there were no new concepts for me to learn. I felt like most people in the room were not avid FB or Instagram users, so a lot of the discussion gave off the vibe of preaching to the choir.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I think my largest contributions to the Turing community this module has been through setting up the Mod1/2 pairings initially and through my work in Armstrong. I've given several presentations in Armstrong and feel like I have brought an enthusiasm to the group through my participation in group discussions and Q&As with Guest Speakers. I think it has helped me grow professionally, in terms of exposing me to new concepts and talking about technical subjects.
