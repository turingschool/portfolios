## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

This inning I focsued on developing my skills as a Machine Learning engineer as well as improving my process surrounding the deconstruction of tough and/large challenges in programming.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
 -- I chose to focus exclusively on Machine Learning for my capstone project. I dug into multiple books on the subject and absolutely loved learning about statistics and really awesome algorithms. Turning these new skills, which involved Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, into a web app proved extremely challenging. I made a poor decision to use Flask, which required more background knowledge than I was able to build up in the time alotted. A few hours after the capstone was due I found Dash, which is a web server built on Flask, using React and Plotly. It's way easier to use and will allow me to focus in on the data, with minimal work displaying it in an approachable, useful way.
 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
 -- I love mathematics. I love to experiment. In fact, throughout the process of experimentation with ML algorithms, I realize that I am meant to experiment. It's how I view the world and how I approach problems. It's definitely not applicable to some situations, but I'll go ahead and do it anyway without regard for the outcome. It's the experiment that is important.
 
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
 -- I took a step back and thought about the big picture. "What do people do when they want to have a web app built on Machine Learning outputs?" So, I googled something like "scientific python web server" and I found Dash, which is exactly what I need. The lesson learned is that there are almost always going to be be multiple options and paths to choose. Always search for the best solution to your particular problem that allows you to utilize your skillset. It's not always necessary to learn something completely new. Chances are, there's already a techonology that suits your purpose as well as your skillset.
 
* What did you learn?
 -- I learned that I have the outlook of an experimentalist. I ask questions, and am not afraid to try different approaches. However, I do get bogged down in the details sometimes and looming deadlines tend to give me tunnel vision. Had I planned what web server I would use at the beginning of the project, I probably would have found the right one and not wasted days on Flask, which I just didn't have the capacity to learn in the final days of the capstone project.
 
## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
 - Webpack was challening in that the configurations were new to me. It was difficult to understand not only what webpack was doing, but how it was doing it.
 
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
 - The lessons were helpful and going back over them while setting up the server was the process I used to get webpack into place. Also, Ben's help was invaluable.
 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
 - Working with Ben Jacobs has always been fun and tackling these challenges with him was great. Getting webpack to do all the things and coming to a greater understanding of the inner workings was a good feeling.
 
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
 - I used CSS3 animations to create a dynamic food list, however it wasn't implemented in the final code due to the length of time it would have taken to refactor the existing HTML and ajax calls. I learned more about DOM traversal and feel pretty solid with that. Lastly, I have a decent understanding of Express and configuring a Node server.
 
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
 - I would spend more time understanding how things are working/communicating rather than focusing on getting them to work and moving on.
 
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
 - It presented the opportunity to theorize on how things are working under the hood. It was a great experience overall, and I feel like it went more smoothly than prior, similar experiences due to our collective experience in learning new things together.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
 -- Please see Assessment above. I talked almost exclusively about Capstone.
 
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
 -- Please see Assessment above. I talked almost exclusively about Capstone.
 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
 -- The mathematics!
 
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
 -- Python (Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook, Virtualenv, Google Machine Learning API, TensorFlow, and loads from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow." I'd highly recommend that book for anyone hoping to step into ML.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
 -- People seem to think I get it. Sometimes I do indeed get it. Sometimes I do not. Nevetheless, since I am my own worst critic, it's really, really beneficial to hear people say positive things about my capabilities. I don't always have self-confidence around programming, so acceptance from others is key in my ability to focus and take on new challenges.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

 -- I gave mostly negative feedback on the Mod-4 led Gear Ups. So, I knew whatever we did we had to do it well. Choosing a Gear Up related to AI was right up my alley and the others in the group recognized that and asked me to do a lightning talk to start the Gear Up. Charlie, Travis, Ben, and Carl were great, enthusiastic, and opinionated partners which made the planning process fruitful. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and felt rewarded by the immediate feedback as well as the feedback given in writing.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
 -- I didn't have much interaction with the community at-large this inning. I maintained my usual cordial, friendly disposition, and talked to some people in the lower mods every now and again. Overall, the Gear Up was my contribution.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
 -- At Turing, I've learned that I can pick up anything in the software world with enough dedication and focus. I'm going to continue to improve upon my process of deconstructing problems. I'm also going to choose to specialize in Machine Learning because it's rad and that's what I want to do. Besides, you get to experiment in ML. And you get paid to do it!
