# (Padraic O'Neill) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Module 2 I promised myself I'd take it easier in order to feel less stressed. I worked on balancing my life at Turing with the rest of my life. I took it upon myself to study extracurricular things like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, a little bit of continuous mathematics, as well as read more. I could have spent more time studying the Turing curriculum, but I feel like I achieved a balance in which I got through the mod with good scores and good exeriences.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work this mod was mostly tutorial driven, which made it difficult for me to keep up with. I took the opportunity of not being graded to study other things relevant to programming, which in the the long run will help me evolve as a more well-rounded programmer.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/podoglyph/job_tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/job-tracker)

Job Tracker tracks companies and the jobs available for each one. Potential job seekers can login and rate their interest in each job to keep a tally of which ones they may want to apply for.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both of my group projects this mod were great. I enjoyed working with more than one other person and I feel like I paired well with my partners. They both presented their own challenges, but I also felt I was able to contribute as well as feel confident in my ability to contribute.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rongxanh88/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

The first group project was called Bike Share. It was an app in Sinatra and consumed a large dataset of bike share rides from the San Francisco area.

## D: Professional Skills
I thought the professional skills work this mod was helpful in preparing us for seeking out connections in the industry. It's great to know that there are people around Denver and around the country who are eager and willing to help us begin our careers in the industry. 

### Gear Up
#### (Empathy)
During this session we were given a chance to see first hand what it is like to be ignored, marginalized, and forgotten. Two classmates were sent our of the room and we were told to ignore them. It felt weird and unnatural for us. And for them it felt pretty bad, too. I could imagine how awkward they must've felt and I recalled doing similar things when I was young. I try my best to be inclusive, I always have (except for being a little shit as a kid now and then). I do enjoy bringing people into the fold and will continue to do so.

#### Parable of the Polygons

During the Gear Up I had a great conversation with a few other people regarding how people perceive other genders and races. It's easy to think there's an easy answer to garnering respect and equality among different people, but this talk helped me to realize that even our best intentions can go awry in the long run. I think the was probably my favorite of the gear ups this mod because the conversation, while a little forced, did lead to some new ways of thinking for me. We questioned whether Affirmative Action is a good thing, and how it may or may not be. It got a level much deeper than a lot of gear-up-inspired conversations.

#### What is Knowledge

This was a poorly organized session with a question much too large to just put upon a group. In the future, a short reading done beforehand would be super beneficial to helping a conversation evolve. If everyone read the same text, they'd actually have something to talk about.

## E: Community Participation
### Playing a Part
I joined the Armstrong Posse and learned about Blockchain this mod. I presented a short talk about Blockchain during one of the sessions.

I gave a lightning talk at wrap-up on Deep Learning. This was a nerve-wracking, but ultimately uplifting experience.

I reached out to mod-1 students to help out where I could and am always friendly to people that I meet around the building.

I always talk to people about Turing and how great (and challenging) the experience is. I recommend it to many people and hope that someday one will enroll based on my introduction.

#### Blog Post

I didn't do a meaningful blog post, but I did a lightning talk on an extremely complex topic and I think I did well in breaking it down into a useful presentation for the school.
