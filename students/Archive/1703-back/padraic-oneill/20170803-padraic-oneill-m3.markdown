# \ Padraic O'Neill - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \ I began Mod-3 with the intention of doing right by me so that I could do right by others and give more effort than the previous two mods. I maintained the personal growth I sought while focusing more on my studies, and changing up my presence as a part of the cohort and the school. Particular to projects, I offered a level of dedication I was proud of, while looking for the weak parts in my process so that I can improve upon it. I took on a lot of the project related things that it seemed others were hesitant or secretly unwilling to do, e.g. styling. I focused less on building out cool API functionality than I had hoped, but I made up for it by taking a serious dive into ActionCable, which turned out to be a long, tiring, and in the end rewarding and path that required me to develop a keener understanding of Client-Server interactions, notably Javascript and the debugging that comes along with it.

>* \ I have the work ethic, I really want to learn to work smarter, though. With the effort I'm willing to put forth, I want to see how much improvement there can be in the end result with a smarter process throughout the course of a project.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/podoglyph/apicurious_github)**
>* \This project involved using GitHub's API to recreate a GitHub user's dashboard page.
>* \Making API requests is kind of fun and satisfying. There's something about getting a heap of raw JSON back that makes me feel good about what I'm doing.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/podoglyph/rails_engine)**
>* \Rales Engine builds out an internal API in order to provide useful sales data.
>* \I began to see and understand the importance of having an API to make relevant, awesome data for a business.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/podoglyph/cloney_island_airbnb)**
>* \A clone of parts of the Airbnb.com site.
>* \Cloning sites has its ups and downs. It's easy to think "this feature is pretty straightforward," when in practice the feature has subtle complexities that only appear as one moves through building it out. Thinking I understand something just because I see a part of it is a problem. It's kind of like an iceberg, most of the weight is hidden.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/podoglyph/corkboard)**
>* \We picked up a clone of Thumbtack and moved it forward.
>* \The initial sense of frustration with the codebase soon gave way to intrigue and enjoyment. We implemented some really awesome features and I got to work with some really talented classmates. Brownfield development requires a new skillset in programming and I was overall happy to learn some of those skills. Our git workflow was better than any project before. Testing wasn't all that great, mostly due to the fact that I/We were implementing new tech that is not so easily tested.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)
\It's sometimes difficult to switch my focus from coding to Gear Ups. The GearUp on Allyship was a particularly bad day for me as I had been so deep into API's that I just didn't want to be there. In hindsight, this was a good thing for that particular GearUp. Since I didn't want to be there, I found it difficult to think rationally about the topics. I was put-off by most of the questions posed in this GearUp and in hindsight I see how difficult it can be to act upon the topics presented in the Allyship GearUp. If I had trouble thinking about the topics in a controlled setting, it must not be easy to consider those same topics in everyday life. The ability of one to see the struggles of others, especially repressed sections of society, is commensurate with that person's ability to empathize with others.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* \We mostly gathered to chit chat and help out where possible.
  >* \Getting free time to work on stuff, ask others about their weeks.
  >* \It mostly helped me understand what others are doing with their time coding.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \I paired with a Mod-1 student a couple of times and paired with a professional mentor, as well. I like to check in with people, see how they are doing, and offer advice if needed.
