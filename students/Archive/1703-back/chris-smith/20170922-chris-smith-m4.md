## Area of Emphasis

Increase my proficiency in JavaScript on both the Frontend and Backend.

## Assessment

**Pass**

From a technical perspective, I could have spent more time on refactoring to further separate out functions, events and displays.  However, I did not have any specific technical challenge with the assessment.

## Quantified Self

* What was your biggest technical challenge?  
Small snags moving from Rails to Express APIs such as configuring CORS, how `knex.raw` is slightly different than `activerecord`

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?  
Applied the necessary Express changes or slightly altered the Frontend to adapt it.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?  
Writing OOP JavaScript and getting to write a backend in Node/Express

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

 * Organizing JS into classes
 * Express Model/Controller organization
 * I decided to increase the challenge of the project by using FlowType on the Frontend pieces I worked on.  This lead me in the direction of a more strongly/explicitly typed JavaScript.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?  
Not using jQuery to update/build the entire DOM. For an app that was even a little more full featured than this, it would get too callback-y too quickly.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?  
Both Bao and I were pretty comfortable with JavaScript before this project, so it did not present any special challenges.  

## Capstone Project

My biggest tech challenge in this mod was trying to learn the MEAN stack 'on the fly' during my Capstone project.  Mongo, Express and Node.js did not cause too many problems, but get the right conventions in place and understanding the moving pieces of Angular was difficult. I really enjoyed learning these new technologies, including Angular.  They all fill gaps that technologies I am more familiar with also fill, so learning new opinions on these tech challenges was fun.

It turns out the specific roadblock I got stuck on was because I was trying to overcomplicate things and find a very new AngularJS specific way of solving my problem.  In the end, I needed to step back, realized that I could still work with Angular and webpack the way I had been in the past.

## Feedback

A common theme from my one-on-one's with Schutte was that if issues come up, I should make sure to reach out early.  This came up earlier in my capstone because I was behind the schedule I thought I needed to be on.  To follow this advice I made sure I communicated with Casey on my progress so there were no surprises.

## Gear Up

Our Gear up process was pretty frustrating.  One of our FE partners did not participate in the planning process and told us an hour before the presentation that it would be too much for him to speak during the Gear up.  

I do not feel like this taught me new skills that help me move forward in my career and it felt like most of the lower mod students would have rather been working on projects.  I think I could have used the 3-4 hours better working on capstones or applying to jobs; however, I always enjoy public speaking, so having a captive audience in the moment was fun.

## Community Involvement

I definitely felt what I have heard from previous Mod 4's, that mod 4 is separated from the rest of the community.  To help correct, that I presented some code to my posse and made a point of attending the Thursday happy hours that Rufus organized.  I think my main community focus this mod was on supporting my cohortmates as we navigated the stresses of completing Turing and starting the next phase.

Community involement is a very important part of Turing.  In fact, it is one of the main reasons I decided to come to Turing.  I firmly believe that we are pushed to be our best selves by those around us.

## Going Forward

It is clich√© but the first skill is learning to learn. Additionally, the knowledge and drive to get out and meet new people in the industry will be invaluable.  One of my other takeaways from Turing is a reinvigoration of wanting to push myself beyond my comfort zone, to push to be better and make a positive impact on the world and people around me.
