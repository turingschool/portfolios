-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[Reddit APIcurious](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/reddit-api)**
> * Clone Reddit by consuming their API <[Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)>
> * Their auto documentation is not great which made working with the API hard.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/rales_engine)**
>* Build an internal API in Rails <[Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)>
>* Great experience working with my partner.  We exceeded all expectations.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Uncorked](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/uncorked)**
>* Clone UnTappd's functionality for Wines.
>* This was a challenging project.  We definitely set out to do more than we could accomplish in the two weeks.  It was fun working with the StreamIO API to build the feed.

> **[AirBnB Clone](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/air_bnb_clone)**
>* We inherited a partially built clone of AirBnB.
>* It was very fun getting to start with a fairly solid existing code base and build up from there.

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:


> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:  
 * Feed class is super clean and reads nicely.  
 * Wonder if we could refactor the FollowsController  
 * The logic in Follow#report_follow feels a little bit like it violates SRP.  
 * Should have more tests at the unit level.
 * Overall really solid just some small refactors. Nice Job!

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microaggression](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
This gear up redefine microaggressions for me. I thought the gear up was going to be about small anger signs/facial expressions.  It was striking to me how much the true microaggressions would wear on a person. It was challenging for me to think about how I would intervene if I was a witness to a microaggression because of my aversion to conflict.  
> [Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)  
This was an insightful gear up in thinking about how to be an ally and challenging me to think about situations where I might not immediately see a need for allyship.  I practiced being an ally just today by participating in a discussion with a (non-Turing) dev what images were appropriate for his podcast.  
> [Fake News Community Gear up](https://gist.github.com/caward12/9b45791a4645995522b4469ab4e53ed9)  
 This gear up taught me that it is extremely important to clearly define what Fake News means before we can tackle it.  This also solidified my opinion that this is probably something we should not leave to private corporations who profit from clicks to handle for us.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>  
  > Mostly I worked on my own projects.  During the last one, one mod 1 student needed a little bit of help with Black Thursday.
  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>  
  > Extra work time to focus on my own non-Turing projects.
  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>  
  > It has reminded me that 'bosses' can make arbitrary decisions that I don't agree with but have to make the best of.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I have mentored/paired with several students throughout the mod. I also helped represent Turing at blockchain hackathon.
