## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Voting Bloc
While we did several individual projects this mod, I was most intrigued by our Rails MiniProject because we were able to pick our own.

I worked on a Voting Rails app.  This allowed for three types of user roles (user, candidate and admin).  All users could vote in an election. Candidates could run and admins could create elections.  Elections had a start and finish time that opened and closed voting.  During this project, I explored user role permissions, dynamic partials, and polymorphic model relationships.

I chose this project as a foundation for further exploration and am continuing to work on this in an attempt to include React and eventually Blockchain.

* [Heroku](https://voting-bloc.herokuapp.com/)

##### Original Assignment Goals:
[Turing assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)
My Outline:

* Elections
* Candidates
* Candidates can participate in many elections and elections can have many candidates
* Users can vote in an election for a candidate
* Admins can create elections and candidates (and relate the two)


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod we focused on larger group projects (4 people instead of 2). The projects were about building full featured Web Applications.  We started in Sinatra and then used Rails.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

Evaluation comments:
controller methods are slim
a lot of Ruby enums slowing down some queries
great use of waffle/gitflow
navigation and flow of app is great from UX perspective, lagtime on views is what stops UX from being client ready and exceptional

Evaluation Scores:
##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

##### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

##### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

##### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

##### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

##### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/little-shop)
* [Heroku URL](https://little-coffee-shop.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

We were tasked with building an e-commerce shop in Rails that sold products, allowed users to see past orders and admins to view and process all orders.

Repo: https://github.com/iamchrissmith/little-shop

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

### 3. Controllers

* 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

### 6. Usability

* 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I have continued to be available to other students for pairing, participated in the Turing Impositors lunch, the after school workout group and became an active member in the Armstrong Posse.  I also gave a school-wide Lightening Talk on Net Neutrality.
