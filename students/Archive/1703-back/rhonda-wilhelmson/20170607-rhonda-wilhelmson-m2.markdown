-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed, yay!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed the individual projects and even implementing a tutorial project on my own through an external Rails book.

#### (Project Name)

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/rwilhel/mix_master)
* [Movie Roulette](https://github.com/wthoma22/movie_roulette)
* [Job Tracker](https://github.com/rwilhel/job-tracker)

I learned a great deal working through these projects. For Movie Roulette, I wish that we were able to implement the API functionality, but the gem that we were using for the Guidebox API (Guidebox Wrapper) did the opposite of what was intended for parsing the API data.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I really enjoyed the opportunity to work in larger groups this module. It was great for becoming better acquainted with Github workflow.

#### (Project Name)

* [Bike Share](https://github.com/rwilhel/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Bike Share: Implementing a web application to track and analyze data from existing San Francisco bike share hubs.

Bike Share Eval Comments:

controller methods are slim
muppets gif was fun
a lot of Ruby enums slowing down some queries
great use of waffle/gitflow
navigation and flow of app is great from UX perspective, lagtime on views is what stops UX from being client ready and exceptional

Bike Share Scores:

1. Functional Expectations: 3
2. ActiveRecord: 3
3. User Experience and Conventions: 3
4. Code Organization/Quality: 3
5. Testing: 4
6. Working Collaboratively: 4

The feedback I received was more for the entire group to better implement the workflow at the head of the project in order to fully grasp the scope of all the work that will be needed.

* [Little Shop](https://github.com/rwilhel/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Little Shop: Creating an e-commerce web application with specified functionality.

Little Shop Eval Comments:

- Some assets not loading in production and development
- Minor misses such as user.name vs User object in view. Feature test was lacking this check
- Tests could/should be broken up into smaller maleable components
- Controllers could use refactors to DRY up, but nothing too alarming
- Small amount of logic in view

1. Feature Completeness: 3
2. Views: 3
3. Controllers: 3
4. Models: 3
5. Testing: 3
6. Usability: 3
7. Workflow: 4

## D: Professional Skills

The Professional Skills development this module has been instrumental in further shaping my outlook and effort with a future career in coding.

### Gear Up
#### (Empathy)


#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

A small bias, no matter how small, has an effect on the collective bias and will impact the types of jobs available to the team members who are unlike the tech executives. I think an effective strategy would be for everyone to make a conscious, concerted effort to reach out to everyone regardless of their demographic and how it matches up to your own.

#### (Privacy vs. Security)

* [GitHub URL](https://turingschool.slack.com/files/dano/F5F6YAE0Z/privacy_gear_up_md.md)

I learned more about the Edward Snowden NSA leaks and thought about whether or not I would or even could do what he did. I decided that even if I did leak the fact that information was being stolen from private citizens, I likely would've waited until I was not working for the NSA. I also thought about the implications and even positive consequences of disclosing the technology to the public.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In my time with the Armstrong posse this module, I helped to organize a meet up for students, alumni and others interested in blockchain technology. I also gave a lightning talk on the ethical and political benefits for implementing blockchain technology into voting. I also gave my time to helping module 1 students with their projects.
