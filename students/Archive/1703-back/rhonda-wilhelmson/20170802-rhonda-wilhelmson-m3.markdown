# RHONDA WILHELMSON - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 3, I desired to obtain a solid understanding of Ruby on Rails, building internal APIs and consuming external APIs.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**

I recreated/rebuilt the Github profile page. I enjoyed this project immensely and I am planning on revisiting it in order to fully build it out and test it with what I learned over the course of the mod.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

Building an internal API to create endpoints that reflect ActiveRecord queries.

I greatly enjoyed this project and the learning experience that building APIs and ActiveRecord queries offered me.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**

Building a clone of the Sygic Travel site with external API consumption with Google Maps, Google Places & Twilio.

I had the opportunity to dig into various tasks in the process of completing the core functionality of this application. In addition to implementing the initial set-up of the project, I also contributed to the initial project styling, dynamic styling and two-factor authentication through Twilio.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**

Taking on brownfield code for an Air BNB clone.

It was fun to dig into the existing code for this project and figure out how to fix the core functionality while also adding new and exciting features. I was able to fix the sign-in functionality using oauth and devise (a gem I was previously unfamiliar with) and deploy the functionality to Heroku which wasn't working before.

In addition to my work in fixing the log-in issues, I also worked with Chris Smith to implement an admin dashboard page with analytics in the form of JavaScript charts populated by ajax calls to internal APIs/ActiveRecord queries.

## C. **Gear Ups**

[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

I think it would help other people who are experiencing micro aggressions to be empathetic to their feelings and to offer support and understanding that, yes, people can be flippantly ignorant toward they way they come off to one another.

[Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

It's important to understand that there's a fine-line when approaching allyship, but that it's incredibly important to the Turing community to recognize individual privilege and use it as a means to do good as an ally.

[Community - Looking Good](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

While "power poses" are a more controversial subject, the concept of non-verbal communication is important to consider as you attempt to convey a message in any sort of environment.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

I volunteered at a BuiltIn Colorado event as a representative of Turing.

#### **Posse**

My posse experience in this module started out strong as we organized to discuss the path we wanted to take, but it quickly fell to the wayside as the organization wasn't maintained across the leaders we appointed in the beginning. A great deal of mentors in our slack channel made themselves available and did provide some valuable insight, but our weekly meetings weren't fruitful.
