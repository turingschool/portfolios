## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Handling a lot of the JavaScript DOM manipulation that was more complicated.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I was able to tackle a few of the filter/search issues and that included referencing documentation and Stack Overflow.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked having the opportunity to finally implement JavaScript in a project in both the front end and back end.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Building an API in Node.js, testing with Selenium, complicated styling with JavaScript.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I think I would reach out for help to people with JavaScript experience sooner.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

I enjoyed working with my partner and supporting each other through learning in areas that were unfamiliar and new.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Building out a 2D side scroller game without having any prior experience in working with Xcode, SpriteKit or Swift.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I consulted several tutorials, Stack Overflow, SpriteKit/Swift documentation and reached out to local developers who had some experience with SpriteKit.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked having the opportunity to work with languages, frameworks and technologies that were completely new and completely up to me.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

I learned how to build an application with Vue.js including performing an external API call to get data, I learned how to build a 2D game with SpriteKit and Swift and I learned about the concepts behind game development like physics and parallax.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

All of the feedback I received regarding handling the job hunt has been incredibly valuable and meaningful. I will definitely be heeding this feedback and implementing it in full-force following graduation.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I greatly enjoyed the subject of our Gear Up session for starters. I enjoyed the experience of planning the session with my group and the anticipation of finally getting to present it. The most challenging aspect was coordinating and making the time to put into developing a robust and engaging session. It was rewarding to experience the students' involvement in our session and the discussion that arose from it.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I gave back to the community by mentoring and helping new students along with representing Turing at various meet ups and events. I think it's important to maintain the connection in the community and create an inclusive environment in all spaces.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

During my next job, I will maintain my excitement to jump into challenges head-first, my love for learning and research and my desire to strengthen diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry.
