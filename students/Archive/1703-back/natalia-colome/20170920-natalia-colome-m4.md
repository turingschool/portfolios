# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Build my confidence using Javascript/React/Node.js and have confidence going into an interview and in my coding skills.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Understanding JavaScript as a whole, I think that was the biggest shift for me, and I still have some trouble understanding how some things work.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Realizing how fast I can learn something and how fast I can build something with that new knowledge.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Pair programming with Squee and having someone to discuss our solutions and our reasons on why we thought that was the right solution.

* What did you learn?

JavaScript!

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Testing and working with join tables and relationships.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Testing: refactored functions to enable as much unit testing as possible, evaluate functionality with postman to validate use

Associations: research error messages and unpredictable behavior and validate through testing (postman)

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Getting to validate through postman and clicking around, using the developer tools to debug, reading through error messages and developing intuition about errors in javascript.

Getting back to basics on the backend, having to build thing from the ground up and having to think how each piece actually works (instead of a framework doing it for us)

Having experience on the frontend and realizing is more than just styling.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Event delegation/ event bubbling 

Un-opinionated nature of javascript and how flexible it can be (for better or worse)

Getting the experience of building the backend and frontend on two separate projects and learning how they communicate, we knew it in theory but it was great to practice it.

Getting to see different javascript elements/tools/frameworks coming together and undesrtanding what their role is in an application (jquery library (DOM manipulation), vanilla javascript, node framework (backend environment), express framework and knex library (db query builder)


* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

Trying to translate models/examples of implentation into my projects, I have a really hard time adapting them and taking a step back and seeing the pattern instead of the actual code, usually at first I only see the code.
I need to improve it because throughout our careers we will be learning new technologies and tools, referencing docs, etc and I need to learn how to abstract concepts and not only implementations.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

It was amazing, Squee was really good applying all the new concepts, specially with the DOM manipulation and it was great to follow her example and learning from her. Also being able to talk it out with someone, do research and have support really accelerated the learning process and made it smoother.
Pairing also helps you move faster through the project and is easier to solve challenges, so I think it fights off a lot of the frustration you get when you're on your own.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

It was my fist time working with React, but besides that, realizing that I wanted my API with a certain style and couldn't make it work. I spent a lot of time trying to fix it and ended up understanding that's why graphSQL exists.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Researching online and testing things in my code. Just being open to break things.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Working on something we chose and having the expectation of working with a technology we have never used. Most of the time we're so pressed to have a working project, so we usually choose a stack we already have experience with; having this opportunity to work with a new tool and realizing how fast we can learn something and turn it into a working project.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  * How to manage 'state' within React - construct object.
  * If a component handles information it should be a class, if not, it should be just a function.
  * Because React nests components in order for it to work, it can get really messy after a while. That's when Redux comes into play.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I think the biggest feedback I received was I know the concepts but I need to communicate them better; and I've had that feedback through a lot of channels (even self-awareness), so I know how to improve, part of it is I get excited or nervous, so keeping calm and figure out what I want to say.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

I didn't like the process of planning the Gear Up because it felt so rushed and with very little actual planning. We had two blocks of time dedicated to them and then we had to give it. I don't want to complain about it, I understand is built that way because we know we're not going to dedicate more time to it, so, if we know people won't dedicate time to do it (because there are so many things going on) then what is the purpose of doing it? I felt akward leading the Gear Up because I didn't feel prepared.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I helped some people from the frontend group with their backend issues and we started a group with all the girls to practice interview questions and held each other accountable on outreach and job applications.

Because we have the privilege to invest 7 months, stop working and just dedicate ourselves to our learning, and be surrounded by people who are interested in our development. A lot of people don't have this, so we learn here how to be supportive to new developers, be willing to help and communicate with others and because we were in their shoes, we can relate better; that way keeping the community supportive and open to new people.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Learning through projects - I think it's the best way to learn and to cement concepts, and it also lets you experiment and play

Reading - reading the problem, reading the error messages, reading the docs, etc. Just taking the time to read and understand can save so much time that is otherwise wasted banging your head against the wall

Document - we're going to work with brown field projects, we're going to track git commits, we should get in the habit on leaving good, descriptive commits, complete and updated readmes, simple and understandable code, keeping notes on our accomplishmets for negotiations with our employers(like this portfolios), etc.
