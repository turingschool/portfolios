# Natalia Colome - M2 BE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main purpose was to learn Ruby on Rails to start developing functional apps with a good UX/UI, focusing on letting TDD guide my work and learning best practices about styling.
Moving forward, I want to have a better understanding about authentication/authorization .

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post
* [My first 6 wks of coding](https://medium.com/@nmcolome/my-first-6-weeks-of-coding-c47948059b47)


#### Rails Mini Project

* [Read Aloud App](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/read_aloud_app)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

Description

This was supposed to be an individual project, but Charlie and I decided to collaborate to develop her idea. The objective was to develop a simple app for library volunteers to record stats of when they read stories at schools.

Learnings

We wrote all the tests before starting any functionality. Even though it required a lot of work and planning, it really improved our process and our workflow. We specially got a lot of practice with Authentication/Authorizations and we really improved our Git Workflow.

#### Mix Master

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/nmcolome/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

Description

Develop an app to keep track of playlists, songs and artists.

Learnings

I learned how to deploy to Heroku and got practice with many-to-many associations. Where I struggled and had a hard time understanding was Factory Girl; in general, I feel very confident with Ruby on Rails, I do want to practice using Factory Girl more, I know it's a very useful tool and I want to take advantage of it. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group projects. Bike Share at the beginning of the mod, where we used Sinatra to develop a site with bike sharing stats; and Little Shop, where we used Ruby on Rails to develop an ecommerce site.
Both projects involved a team of four people, which was an interesting dynamic very different from pair projects.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Description

-	Use of Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

Evaluation Comments

-	We need to improve the assignments of tabs in Waffle. They're too general - be more specific.
- great sad paths! with user-facing error messages!
- API and google maps extensions
- controllers are slim, minimal logic
- templates look great for formatting and not having logic
- UX is snazzy
- google charts!
- really impressive models with logic and DRY extraction
- could DRY up testing

Feedback to me

- We did a group feedback to figure out how to move forward (2 days before submitting the project). Because all of the subjects were new, we all wanted to participate in every aspect of the project and that made it very difficult to distribute work effectively. After that talk we all agreed on focusing on one learning goal which helped a lot. Besides that,  I was told I collaborate very well and that they felt I made an effort to keep the team together and that everyone felt they were contributing, which I really appreciated.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Benja-Ross/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

Description

-	Use of Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

Evaluation Comments

- UX is fantastic - super clean, usable, well designed
- New items not creating category association
- Factories look fantastic
- All feature tests were created before starting project which really drove whole site production
- stylesheets look amazing - component based, used Sass tools, etc
- views made good use of partials
- Do a better use of waffle to keep track of our work

Feedback to me

- We did a group feedback and we worked really well together. We were very happy that even though we didn't work on each part of the project we each specialize in a different thing that will be a strength in future projects. On things to improve is our waffle tracking and communication about schedule changes. The first week we agreed on working until a certain time and we never committed to it; after having a group discusion we agreed on a new schedule. It was a great experience and I enjoyed working with them.

## D: Professional Skills

#### Cold Outreach I

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_two/cold_outreach_i)

We learned how to contact effectively our mentors and why this relationship is important. Even though I wasn't very succesful, I do appreciate the importance of having someone to talk to and seek for advice, specially when we're starting a new career path. I plan to reach out more during the intermission week and cultivate a meaningful relationship with a mentor.

#### Collaborative Communication

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_two/collaborative_communication)

We learned about project management practices (agile vs waterfall) and to ask questions and use that to guide a conversation instead of order people around (this way we have a better understanding of the situation and we build a respectful relationship) and how to handle failure within a group by not addressing it as something to blame for, but something to learn from.

#### Feedback II

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_two/feedback_ii)

We learned how to give feedback, the importance of active listening and to be aware of the other person's reaction (switchtracking, body language, wording, etc.). Also on having a very clear purpose for the conversation and clear examples on how to handle them.

#### Feedback III

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/career_development_curriculum/module_two/feedback_iii)

We used the Johari window and learned about how other people view us. I really enjoyed this, specially afterwards chatting with classmates and discussing our results. I think it's a very interesting topic and it's always very important to know how are we seen by others (versus how I think I'm seen).

#### StrengthsFinder: Teamwork

We talked about how our strengths our reflected in our teamwork and in our collaboration styles. I enjoyed that people were true to their strengths, they would describe it and (having worked with them) I could make the connection to their actions or attitudes. A takeaway is to be aware that the styles, actions, attitudes, etc are a reflection of each person's values and strengths; which seems obvious but is very easy to forget.

### Gear Up

#### Empathy

We talked about being aware that we all want to be surrounded by people that are similar to us, and that is very easy (specially in a work environment) to segreate groups or people because they're different. We must make an effort to build a welcoming environment and to encourage diversity, and work for inclusivity and being aware that we can make a difference on how a person is treated and viewed.

#### Parable of the Polygon/Automation

I learned that being neutral about a topic does not fix it (in this case diversity). We have to make an effort to be more inclusive, it's understandable that people want to be surrounded by their peers, but we have to be conscious about our environment and how we can impact it for better or worse. Knowing this, we need to see past our biases and always push for a welcoming environment and look for balance within our groups.

#### Choose your own adventure: Dangers of a single story

The biggest learning was the realization that we get bombarded with the same story about a country/race/etc through news, tv, stories, movies and there comes a point were we believe that's the only story. It's inevitable to have that perspective but we must be aware of this, so we are open to learning and not make assumptions.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I joined the Armstrong Posse this mod. We learned about Blockchain and we are trying to participate in meetups and hackathons to be more involved in the community. My contribution was to discuss within the posse how we could contribute to a hackathon (our proposal was commiting to help organize it, not participating) and I participated in the Salary Bot hackathon to learn what a hackathon is, how people work and what they need, best practices and things to avoid.

My favorite experience within the posse was getting to meet people that are more knowledgable in the subject and working on learning new things with the whole group.

My posse has helped me grow as a professional because it has given me a guidance on how to start learning a new language, to search not only for resources (like tutorials) but also, to look for the community and find ways to participate.
