# Natalia Colome - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Throughout the module I was striving to keep up and get at least average results in the different sections of each rubric. As I'm feeling more comfortable, I've been focusing on doing the extra exercises and reviewing my past work to see in which particular areas I can improve (testing, managing large amounts of data). While my focus has been on finishing each project, I've been paying more and more attention on my style and encapsulation to try to keep my code as simple and clean as possible. Also, I've been trying to develop habits and using tools to be as productive as possible.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Chris Smith):

**Feedback for Chris:**

> I really appreciate the way you organized our work, how you accepted my input and improved the code with your better knowledge of Ruby.  Also, you are very resourceful, always bringing additional features to improve our work and most of all, you are a great teacher. I think you have great communication skills and I enjoyed our time working together.
With regard to opportunities to improve, I think it applies to both of us, we were so happy with our work we didn't tested it correctly so it's important to be aware of this and try to get an extra set of eyes or be more cautious in the future. Also, we worked really well as Driver-Navigator so we never tried Distributed Pairing, and it would have been interesting to try it.

**Feedback from Chris:**

> Natalia was great to work with.  She had a strong understanding of the Ruby methods and code organization we needed to complete this project.  We worked well as a team and were able to clearly talk through any challenges we came across.  Upon reflection, one of the things I think we both agree we could have done better is be more skeptical and/or play devil’s advocate. This would have helped us catch holes in our testing/logic.  Since used the driver/navigator style for the project, we didn’t get as much of a chance to practice our Git branching and pull requests or to do code presentations/reviews.  I look forward to working with Natalia again.

#### Project 2 (Charlie Corrigan):

**Feedback for Charlie:**

> Even though our project was very challenging and sometimes frustrating, I really enjoyed working on it with you. I love how you write down things to better understand them and how you took your time to explain them to me. Even though we have different approaches to working on a problem, we worked really well and we complemented each other. You are very logical, methodical and calm and I really appreciated your balance, specially when I started feeling frustrated about the project I could count on you step back and put things into perspective.
> There is always something we can improve: remembering to do more git commits, splitting our work load sooner and checking in with our classmates to look for opportunities in our code, but as a partner, you communicate really well, you were open to my input and I have nothing but great things to say about you.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

It's important to keep in mind that my abilities can be developed. I have to be patient and trust myself, my strengths and my learning process. Always remember: I can't do something *yet*; but I *will* learn how. I'm adaptable and I'm always growing as a person.
Even though sometimes frustration or stress can trigger a fixed mindset, we must keep en eye on our on thoughts and get in the habit of stop our negative talk and accept that through failure we learn.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

I have limited cognitive resources and I need to manage them well in order to learn more efficiently. There are three stages of learning: can't do -- do with effort -- mastered. To better manage my learning process I should focus my learning on a few, more specific skills; break thing into pieces, get high-quality high-quantity examples, find mentors or pairings to guide me and immerse myself in the environment. So it's basically focus on small things at a time and surround myself in the field to be constantly in contact with what I want to learn.  

#### Session 3: Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert

It was interesting to learn about the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, how people saw themselves and were open to talk about what they need to do to work better. It was great to reflect about it and think about what I can leverage in myself and what can I do to make others feel their best and do their best.

#### Session 4: Storytelling & Strengths (StrengthsFinder I)

It's interesting to see how, with practice, we get better at telling our story. I love that through the exercises we do (a story we like, the strengths we have, what were we doing before Turing and were we see ourselves after) we can find common things that helps us build our story but also identify the things that we identify with. I'm eager to develop it through out the following mods.

#### Session 5: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

I loved the documentary and I would have liked to have more time to discuss it, but it sparked interesting conversations the following days. It's important to be aware of how our behaviour (even if unconscious) affects others and what we can do to change it. For me, it was disappointing, but not surprising, the lack of respect there is towards (in this case) women in the Technology industry but it just motivates me more to create opportunities for myself and others.

### Community Participation

I wanted to participate more in the community but sometimes it felt overwhelming; specially at the beginning of the mod. Nonetheless, I attendend every Guest Speaker Series, all but one Meetup event, joined the Wozniak posse and mondays Productivy Lunch; and tried Impostors group. Even though I didn't paired with upper mod students as much as I would have liked, I did develop a good relationship with my classmates; specially through the paired projects
