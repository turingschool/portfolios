#### Notes



## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://gist.github.com/alex-w-k/ff2d1ec2b6e538f5d0bfbc0cf19a37b2) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Carl Richmond): 
Feedback from Carl
```
I found that Alex allowed me to think through problems before adding his
opinion, which really helped me learn throughout the project. And he didn't
assume his opinion was inherently correct, so I felt we had a good back and
forth. As for the DTR, we both decided our end goal was to incorporate emojis.
which really directed our efforts, so that was good. There was one day that he
was late to a study session, but we talked about it and didn't have another
issue. I felt that we communicated well and contributed equally. He wasn't
domineering and was open to my ideas. A great pair project overall!

```

Feedback for Carl:

```
"Our pair project went really well. We didn't run into any big problems. I 
really appreciated the way Carl was able to "go with the flow" when I was
running a little late from a lunch that I had planned on sunday, when we were
working after that."
```

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1

A growth mindset is important while going through Turing because you need to make sure that you are willing to grow
because if you tell yourself you are not up for this, then you won't be. You need to have a positive mindset and ready to grow.

#### Session 2

Getting better at difficult things, you need to not just practice, but be totally immersed in the problem, and use intentional practice.

#### Session 3

Both introverts and extroverts need to make sure they think of one another and their differing working styles in order to work
most efficiently. Most people will also not be just introvert or an extrovert most people are somewhere in the middle.


#### Session 4

We need to be able to tell a story when applying for a job or in networking situations and we need to learn how to 
make it clear consise and relatively quick. Practicing this can help with all of that and help you weed out unnessisary
information.


#### Session 5

```
I liked the question to the girls what do coders look like.

Google pay gap. 
Tech companies still being found to pay women less than men.

Fucking gender norms
  -- pastel fucking colors
  -- words we use to describe women vs men 
      -- Girls vs women 

'Wife compatible' is a common thing said on the internet concerning tech things
meaning they are easy for a person with no computer experience to use... 
```

### Community Participation
I have helped spearhead Turings involvement at PrideFest this year.
