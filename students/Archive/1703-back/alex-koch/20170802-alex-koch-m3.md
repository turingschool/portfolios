## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> [link](https://github.com/alex-w-k/rails-engine)
>* \ A sales data api built with Rails 5.1 and Ruby 2.4.1. This engine serves up record, relationship and business intelligence JSON for the included dataset.
>* \ It was awesome learning how to build out an API as it's something that's often used and seems to be increasing more and more as we want more JS front ends and APIs for backends.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/uncorked)**
>* \This is a project to build a clone of UnTappd.com but for Wine.
>* \ I learned that DevOps is hard, and I learned I need to know when to cut my losses and stop chasing things that aren't working.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/corkboard)**
>* \ A clone of thumbtack
>* \ I learned that DevOps can be awesome if it all works right and is challenging but super fun to do.
