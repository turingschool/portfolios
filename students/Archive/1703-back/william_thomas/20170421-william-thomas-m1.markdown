# William Thomas - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I began my journey with Turing emphasizing the importance of intellectual growth over simply just "coding".  Joining not only a school to become a well rounded and professional developer, but for personal growth in a supportive community.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Enigma):

**Feedback for Sam Lim:**

> For the Enigma project, I was partnered with Sam Lim. I had a great partner project experience and only have positive things to say. If I had to select something, the only thing I can think of would be Sam having a fast pace on the first day when we were separated, so I had trouble catching up up the next day. This was not an issue however, as we were able to work together and I was able to catch up on what was missed relatively quickly.  All in all, I wouldn't change a thing and had a perfect first pairing project with Sam.

**Feedback from Sam Lim:**

> Overall I think you did an excellent job as a pair. We worked through the various challenges logically and communicated ideas of what we had in mind when it came to pseudocoding. Your biggest strength in the project would definitely be writing our unit/integration tests for our various classes. For some coaching, I'd like to recommend getting more familiar with branching and branch organization. We both had issues with this, and I believe it is something we both need to work on. Other than that I would love and hope to work with you again on future projects!

#### Project 2 (Headcount):

**Feedback for Bao Nguyen:**

> It was a great pleasure working with you on the Headcount project.  Overall, I believe we were a great team together and created a fantastic final project.  We were able to work diligently in a positive environment, delegating workloads appropriately whilst never running into any issues.  I have no negative feedback to give, just that I believe some more practice and growth within git workflow would be beneficial for your overall productivity. I had a great time working with you, Bao, and appreciate how much I learned through seeing your implementations within the project.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

Out of all the gear up sessions thus far, I believe discovering and truly understanding the growth mindset has had the greatest impact on my self improvement.  Coming fresh into a completely new environment can be daunting if the mind is focused on negativity or a fixed mindset.  Understanding that I may not know everything right now but have the potential to grow, helps to focus on the positive outcomes as opposed to frustration or negativity in a moment of confusion.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

Difficult things are difficult...  This is why this gear up was so beneficial!  I enjoyed witnessing alternative ways to handling difficult situations and envisioning ways to overcome these obstacles.  Certain situations may seem more concerning or stressful until you are able to understand methods to break them down into smaller components.  Focusing on high quantity and high quality learning will generate far better outcomes.

#### Session 3: Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert

This session was also extremely valuable in multiple ways.  Not only did it help to understand my own personality styles better, but also helped me to understand how others may operate, and the best ways to have empathy and work together in various environments.

#### Session 4: Storytelling & Strengths (StrengthsFinder I)

This particular session was tremendously beneficial.  Even though telling a simple story of myself in an "elevator talk" setting sounds simple, when in the moment it becomes quite difficult to discuss.  With practice, I can become more confident and concise with my words, articulating thoughts or ideas more efficiently.  You never know when the time may arise and practicing storytelling and knowing your specific strengths will come in handy.  It was also fascinating to see what five strengths I personally held and how to take advantage of these strengths.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

In my opinion, this gear up was one of the most informational and prevalent within our current society.  As an advocate for equal treatment, it is always important to learn the issues at hand and communicate possible ways to help decrease these issues in the future.  I was very thrilled to see the video discussing topics such as societies influence on females from a very young age and the impact that influence may have on decisions they could potentially make within the future.  I believe there should be more incentives and education focusing on increasing female and minority presence within the industry.

### Community Participation

Within this module, I did my best to be supportive of all my fellow classmates throughout the program, both with the programming material, as well as emotional support when needed.  As a community, we were able to bond in and outside of the school, developing a stronger team and cohort.  Although module one is extremely time consuming, clearly there is room for growth that I am already looking forward to pursuing in later modules.
