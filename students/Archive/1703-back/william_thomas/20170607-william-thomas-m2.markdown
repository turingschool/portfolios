# William Thomas - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Within this past module there were multiple goals and expectations I wanted to accomplish for myself.  To start, I wanted to become even more comfortable and confident with coding both in Rails and Ruby.  The curriculum was perfect for this goal and I believe I was successful in this endeavor.

My next goal was to become a better teammate and partner within paired projects.  It was exciting to be given the opportunity to work in even larger groups where more communication was vital was necessary. Working with three others in a high stress environment can be challenging, but I believe every single project I was grouped in was a success.  Throughout this module, we had a strong emphasis on communication and empathy which helped myself focus on this particular area even more.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Retook the final assessment.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Aside from the group projects, my two favorite individual projects were the rails mini project, entitled Movie Roulette, and Job Tracker.

#### (Project Name)
Rails Mini: Movie Roulette

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wthoma22/movie_roulette)

* (description)
For this project we decided to create an app that would work as a centralized location for many streaming sites.  We attempted to take in api data in the form of a gem and use it to extract data from the sources.  The main take aways from this project were developing skills with api's and creating a search bar for database queries.  We were unable to full implement this project, but it was a great learning experience on materials and concepts that we will learn within the next module.

* (evaluation scores)
2.5 for completeness.
3 for ingenuity

#### (Project Name)
Job Tracker
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wthoma22/job-tracker)

* (description)
Job Tracker was one of the first and larger rails projects I implemented. It was challenging but extremely rewarding in multiple ways.  There were many take aways from this particular project but if I was to choose one I would say learning the inner workings of rails and becoming familiar with its structure was very advantageous.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Working in such large groups this module was one of the best learning experiences for myself.  I wanted to place a strong emphasis on becoming better with git workflow and develop a skill-set for group work that would be similar to real work scenarios.

#### (Project Name)
Bike Share

* [Bike Share](https://github.com/wthoma22/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/tmikeschu/bike-share)

(description)
A project using Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application collects data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application provides a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

(evaluation comments)
Ran into issues right at the end. Weather dashboard broken. 2 hr extension to address. UPDATE: resolved
Tests very solid. Dashboard tests missing
Model tests solid
Controller very clear. Organization solid in general.

(feedback to me)
Great teamwork and communication. I personally had do negative feedback for myself or for my partners.  We all had a positive experience and felt very comfortable and satisfied with our environment throughout the project.

#### (Project Name)
Little Shop

* [Little Shop](https://github.com/Benja-Ross/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

(description)
In this project you'll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

(evaluation comments)
UX is fantastic - super clean, usable, well designed
New items not creating category association
Factories look fantastic
All feature tests were created before starting project which really drove whole site production
stylesheets look amazing component based, used Sass tools, etc
views made good use of partials

## D: Professional Skills
Growing even more as a professional has always been an important aspect of my time here at Turing.  This module in particular has been extremely effectively and helpful in this regard.  Both through group projects, and through various lessons such as the cold outreach.
These lessons helped me grow as a professional and network myself to the tech community.

### Gear Up 1 - Empathy
* [GitHub URL](N/A)
Having empathy and compassion is a key element for group work and a useful skill to have for the future.  Obtaining a strong emotional intelligence base is the link between the self and others.  I learned how important it is to attempt to experience others feelings as if it were our own and to try to make a change with any opportunities we have available.


### Gear Up 2 - Tragedy of the Commons
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
Out of all the gear ups this module, Tragedy of the Commons was one of my favorites.  Not only to experience a unique and interesting tech game showing how important diversity is for everyones happiness, but also to speak to other Turing members in other cohorts.  
The game spoke on real issues we all face today and ways we can attempt to overcome them.

### Gear Up 3 - Case Study - Knowledge
* [GitHub URL](N/A)
Philosophy is and has always been one of my favorite topics to discuss.  We spoke on knowledge and the cycle of attempting to understand these hard topics.  We then were able to place these strategies into our learning here at Turing in regards to coding.  We can take a similar approach with facing problems and come up with mindful solutions to difficult situations.


## E: Community Participation

#### (Armstrong Posse)
This past module I became deeply connected and intrigued with blockchain.  Hence, why I decided to join the Armstrong posse.  It was one of the greatest decisions I made for myself.  The posse was dedicated to everyone having an equal share in both the learning and teaching process.  We were able to reach out to multiple members within the blockchain community, including former members of Turing.  Learning a new and developing language was daunting and hard at times but well worth the investment.  Especially considering the fact that many financial companies are now picking up blockchain which is a field I am considering going into.

#### (Blog Post)
Mod 1
My experience at Turing has been the most challenging, yet most rewarding and worthwhile experience I have ever undergone. The past six weeks of the program have taken an intense yet incredibly effective learning approach that has enabled myself to establish a solid foundation of knowledge in multiple areas of software engineering. These areas include but are not limited to, skills to write automated tests, pseudo-coding, writing implementation code, and refactoring code to meet Ruby conventions. My favorite technical concept I have enjoyed learning is object-oriented programming. This is the core of Ruby programming, directing the programmer to focus on the content of each object and how that object itself behaves. So far, I have loved every second of my experience with Turing and greatly look forward to the experiences yet to come.

### Playing a Part

Recently I have been speaking with an old friend within the community to help with Develop Denver, a creative development workshop for developers, designers, & anyone who is interested in code.
