# Charlie Corrigan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wasn't sure what to expect of Mod2 before it began. All of the content covered this mod was completely new to me. The first couple of weeks were pretty challenging -- trying to learn Sinatra, Rails, Active Record, SQL, and HTTP request/response cycle felt like a Herculean task. Then, working through our first group project with only one other person in my 'group' added an extra level of challenge. After the first two weeks, the paced slowed somewhat and I was able to practice these new tools quite a bit and was able to become more comfortable using them. This mod I was most excited to start learning about authentication and authorization. And, I was also excited to have chosen a partner and begun work on a project for the Denver Public Library Read Aloud program.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects this mod were often tutorial-style and provided more of an opportunity for scaffolded repetition than creativity. The reps were incredibly helpful in gaining comfort with the many tools we've been introduced to.

#### Jobs Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/job-tracker)

An app that tracks companies and the jobs associated with them, with commenting functionality. This was my first opportunity to practice styling a Rails app.

(Unevaluated)

#### Blog Post

* [GitHub URL](http://www.charliepscorrigan.com/blog/recursive_tacos.html)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/homework/)

A blog post meant to explore recursion in a way that is friendlier to beginner coders than the usual Fibonacci example.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I thoroughly enjoyed all of my group projects this mod. The first project, Bike Share, was a challenge to complete with only two group members instead of four. But, it was a fantastic collaborative exerience and I was very proud of the project Mason and I created. It was also a valuable experience in learning how to create a minimum viable product on a deadline. The second group project was my Mini Rails Project. For this project, I chose Natalia to partner with me in creating the first iteration of a Read Aloud stats app for the Denver Public Library. It was such a great experience to be able to meet with real clients and learn how to interpret customer needs into a custom web app solution. Natalia and I intend to continue work on this project throughout Mod 3 and Mod 4. The final group project, Little Shop, was again a new experience. It was my first time working in a larger group at Turing and also my first experience serving as project manager of a group project at Turing.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

A web app that tracks rented bicycle use in a San Francisco based bike-share program.

Notes from Lauren and Mike:
- would really like to see i9 completed
- nav bar switches around on user
- try to limit AR methods to 1 query per method (update in addition to update_city_id)
- intermediary date tables could be replaced with AR aliased foreign keys


* Functional Expectations
  - 3: Application fulfills base expectations
* ActiveRecord
  - 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.
* User Experience and Conventions
  - 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.
* Code Organization/Quality
  - 3.5: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.
* Testing
  - 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* Working Collaboratively
  - 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

(feedback to me)

#### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/read_aloud_app)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

A web app used by library volunteers and staff to track the attendees of their story times at local elementary schools. The app is also used by staff to manage volunteer accounts and their stats entries. Data will be fed monthly into an API that belongs to the library's new larger event data management system currently being built by another contractor. Specs for this project will evolve over the next three months as we meet with various staff and present multiple iterations.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL]()

During this Gear Up, we participated in an exercise that involved sending two classmates out of the room for a few moments and everyone else was given secret instructions to ignore them completely when they returned. It was harmless enough in the end, but I felt super uncomfortable treating my classmates that way, even for the purpose of a demonstration. It felt a little like the Milgram experiments. Other than that piece, I enjoyed the session and it felt really valuable to hear Emily's experiences in the post-Turing world.

#### Parable of the Polygons

* [GitHub URL]()

The Parable of the Polygon session included an interactive app based on a study about segregation completed in the 1970s. While the app was interesting, the discussion that followed was somewhat derailed by someone in our small group who felt very strongly that the most important aspect of the discussion was whether or not tech execs actually are in charge of hiring, that because tech execs don't make hiring decisions their biases don't matter and, this person concluded, that the discussion questions were therefore invalid. The larger group discussion centered around why anonymous interviews are possibly a panacea for discrimination, which is something I think the app/study was directly contradicting.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL]()

Before coming to Turing, I worked with children experiencing poverty. Because of my professional experience seeing some of the human consequences of income disparity, I came into this Gear Up with fairly strong opinions -- not necessarily on implimentation of UBI, but on the need for some solution for the people who suffer the physical, psychological, and emotional consequenses of being "unsuccessful" in our economy. We watched a Ted Talk and engaged in small group discussions afterwards. I really appreciated the emphasis on needing to base decisions on facts and needing to gather facts through larger studies.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In spite of what upper-mod students had insinuated while I was in Mod1, I did not, in fact, find Mod2 to be any easier or less demanding than Mod1. While I was able to continue pairing with upper mod students and paired some with Mod1 students (pairing that focused on both coding as well as emotional support), I still wasn't able to give posses the time and energy I had hoped coming into Mod2. Still, I think my community participation in less organized ways has been generally positive.
