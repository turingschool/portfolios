## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is my individual rails project

#### A Sword of Ice and Fire

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MasonHolland/a_sword_of_ice_and_fire)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

For my rails mini project I decided to apply my newly earned skills in an interesting way. What I attempted to make was a database that would store all of the swords from the A Song of Ice and Fire series. Each sword had its own page and through that page you would be able to view all the past wielders("users") of that sword. Each user belonged to a sword. Each sword had many users. Each user belonged to a house but each house had many users. I had 4 seperate "roles" on my site and this really helped me understand authentication and authorization.
I gained a lot from this project in terms of practice and repititon. However my intial hopes and scope for the project were not met. The finished project is nothing like what I had envisioned but I intend to keep working on this and turning it into something.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are my Group Projects

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MasonHolland/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Bike share was our week 1 project that was our introduction to Sinatra, CRUD, Routes and Databases. I really enjoyed this project. I had Charlie as my partner, it was originally a 3 person group. Our group was cut short though after the first weekend and so we inherited a large workload. This was very good for my learning though, it helped to force me to spend as mcuh time as I could in the code. I did come out of the project a little fried though and I think this contributed to my slacking off in the coming week. I am very proud of the product we made though. Looking back I see plenty of room for refactoring and knowing rails now, the controller is extremely painful to look at especially. Knowing what we did at the time though I feel it was a good achivement.

Evaluation Notes
*would really like to see i9 completed
*nav bar switches around on user
*try to limit AR methods to 1 query per method (update in addition to update_city_id)
*intermediary date tables could be replaced with AR aliased foreign keys

Evaluation Scores
1. Functional Expectations

2. ActiveRecord

3. User Experience and Conventions

## D: Professional Skills

  Here are the professional development sessions from this module

### Gear Up
#### (Agile Practices Project Management)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/agile_practices_project_management_intro.md)

This session helped illustrate 2 approaches to programming that I was somewhat aware of. I was aware of them in the sense that I was actively using both to some degree but didn't know the terms for them. Now when planning out a project I think abuot which approach woud work better and why. I will use this information in the future.

#### (Cold Outreach)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

This session was focused on reaching out to a stranger and organizing a meetup. This is something I am generally uncomfortable with so I was keen to try my hand at it. I reached out to one of the provided mentors and never heard back. So I gave up on that and now my close friend is my mentor. I will have an oppurtunity to do a cold reach in the future and I plan to use these tools when that time comes.

#### (Collaborative Communication)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)

This session was helpful in laying out some ground reals when communating with a team member. These sessions are always useful as they reaffirm the practices I try to implement when talking to others. I have yet to have a bad experience with a team mate but these sessions will be essential in ensuring I navigate that situation tactfully and respectfully.
#### (Johari Window)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md
)

This was my favourite session of this module. I really enjoyed getting back my results and seeing how thye lined up with twaht others experienced. I found the feedback direct and relevant. I only wish I had more group partners so I could get more results. I will use this in the future and I have referenced it since.

#### (Teamwork & Strengths)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/teamwork_and_strengths.md)

This was a valuable session as always. ```Implement method to insert this at the start of each of these ```
I enjoyed reflecting on my strengths and seeing how I have changed in the last 13 weeks. I hope to be able to take one of those tests in the future and see the changes in the results.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

*Did at least 1 pairing each week. Often more than 2 a week.
*Participated in some Posse get togethers
*Accepted SAB position for next mod
*Helping people when I can. Holding doors and such.
