# (Jack Mallahan) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 I was really excited heading in to Mod 3 to brush up on my React skills and to learn Redux. By the time we went on our job shadow, I was amazed that I was able to not only understand, but contribute to the code base at Craftsy. By working on my Personal Project I feel like I have a really strong understanding of Redux, React, React Router, Firebase and Functional Programming.

### SWAPIBox

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anajauregui/SWAPI-box)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

 This was a great project to really hammer home the finer points of React and Asynchronous Javascript completed over just three days.

 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

 This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies using a backend with PostgreSQL and using Redux on the frontend.

### Personal Project

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/geard)
 * [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

I created 'Geard' an app that allows users to rent out outdoor gear to other outdoor enthusiasts. It utilizes Redux, React, React Router 4, and Firebase for user authentication and a database to store all gear items.

## D: Professional Skills

   I really enjoyed the professional skills that we worked on this mod. My job shadow experience really helped me have confidence that I can not only hang, but thrive in the real world. Plus, I have honed my cold outreach skills and have set up several coffee dates and feel confident about some of the leads that I have working.

### Gear Up
#### Group Think

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

 Group Think is real, you might even say especially at Turing. It is really easy when a whole group of people are together for one common goal to not fall into some sort of group think. That's not always bad.


### Gear Up
#### Micro Agressions

 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

This gear up session made me remember the quote, 'A death by 1,000 cuts' from the 'Bridging the Gender Gap' video we watched in Mod 1. Micro Aggressions happen all the time, all around us. This was a really great session that led to some great discussion between several Turing students very late at night.


### Gear Up
#### UI/UX

I unfortunately was unable to attend this Gear Up because of my medical issues with my crazy ear infection. The resources JC sent out before hand were really good though and I implemented some of the information in my personal project.

 -----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I thought I did a good job of being a part of the community this Mod by looking outward and reaching out to Turing Alums. I have had a few coffee dates now and phone conversations. I plan on being readily available once I too have a sweet job.

totes forgot about being a posse lead. my b fam.
