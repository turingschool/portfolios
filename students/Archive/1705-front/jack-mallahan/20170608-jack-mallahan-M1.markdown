# Jack Mallahan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming to Turing, I was excited to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript while in Mod 1. I didn't expect to also discover the best ways for me to learn personally. Turing not only gave me excellent training in hard development skills, but also very helpful soft skills to broaden my scope and make me a better person as well as developer.  I think that the concept of a growth mindset that they teach here at Turing really helped me conquer Mod 1 even after my difficulties with the ideabox project.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In Mod 1 we conquered Dog Party, Number Guesser, Static Comps, and Javascript Foundations individually to ensure our progression in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

#### Dog Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/dog-party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/html-1.html)

Dog Party was our introduction into HTML and CSS. This laid down the framework for our future Static Comps.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our first complete project where we had to create a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Number Guesser is a game that prompts users to guess a number between 1 and 100, and gives them clues as to if the guess was higher or lower. Functionality that was added was the ability for the user to input their own parameters, and once they guessed correctly the range grew by 10 in either direction. Number Guesser was our introduction to Javascript and I learned an incredible amount about its logic and syntax.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

#### Static Comps

* [Static Comp 3 GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/static-comp-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The Static Comp Challenges really pushed us to flex our HTML and CSS muscles. As you can see in the Static Comp 3 that I have included, I went from having absolutely no experience in HTML and CSS to feeling extremely competent and capable. The static comp 3 also showed me the value of using a mentor to help my process become more efficient and more organized.

Score: Recorded above in final assesment section.

#### Javascript Foundations

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/javascript-foundations)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations)

Javascript Foundations was actually really fun. It is all about manipulating objects and arrays, and these logic problems were *usually* really fun for me.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In Mod 1 we were required to complete linked-list, ideabox, and 2-do-box (ideabox pivot/refactor). In general I really enjoyed my paired projects, shout out to Jason, Erik, and Dan. Erik and I did have great sadness when it came to ideabox, but since then I have kept at my javascript and more importantly local storage skills and with my growth mindset, I have pushed through to a place where I feel proficient.

#### linked-list

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In this project, Jason and I created an application that allows the user to put their ideas down in boxes on a page. I learned a lot as this was my intro to jQuery and from Jason in terms of what it means to be a good partner and how to be successful in the pairing process.

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

Through phase 4

Nicely done! Really good job, good distribution of

UI is a little bit too wide on big screens, so have a max-width that kicks in to control line lengths.

I had very good experience pairing with you on the Linked List project last week.   You communicated very well and accomplished all of your tasks on time.  I think that learning more Jquery syntax and commands would be good area for you to focus your learning moving forward in Mod1.  This project went very smooth, got done ahead of schedule and was no stress.  Thank you.

#### ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project, Erik and I had some great sadness. I was feeling extremely confident as I was one of the first people in the class to learn how to save and retrieve things from local storage, so I spent a lot of time teaching others how to get past that major hurdle. From there it went a little down hill. I admit that in this project by the end I succumbed to a fixed mindset, and we couldn't finish.

|Advanced Beginner  | Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec. |

##### Feedback from Erik
Jackie Boy! It was great working on Idea Box with you even though it pretty much kicked our ass. I learned a lot through that battle though. You were a great partner. We had constant and effective communication, you were available and determined to finish (even though we couldn't) and you were understanding of my struggles with JavaScript/jQuery. It helped me out a great deal driving while you explained the JS code we were implementing and what the function/event listener was doing. I also really like the idea to write down our daily tasks and attack them in a strategic way. The only coaching I can think of probably stems off of my lack of help with JS/jQ. During those late nights when our brains were shutting down, communication was lacking a bit, and I think we got off track. Not that I was able to help much, but just something to keep in mind. Again, it was great teaming up with you homie. Even though we weren't able to achieve all of our goals, I learned a lot and had a good time. Peace, Erik aka Rick

#### 2-do-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/2-do-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In this project, Dan and I received Jason and David's code for ideabox and pivoted it to be a teaux-deaux box. This solidified my understanding of jQuery, manipulating local storage, and refactoring code. This was the first project where I felt like the github workflow was utilized 100% correctly. 

## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

some missed refactoring opportunities, overall good work but could have polished the codebase a bit more and really taken advantage of the opportunity to correct choices in the code that were not ideal.

##### Feedback from Dan
Jack- I think we worked well together. We both had a good grasp on the css, html, javascript and jquery. I think we both fed off each other's energy which made the process much more light hearted. My only coaching for us is that we could have been slightly more organized in our planning, but other than that I think we took care of business and meshed well together. I liked how open we were, and how we were both willing to receive help from MOD 4 people, MOD 2 people as well as classmates. I especially liked how after we received help from MOD 4 we were cruising through the requirements of the project. I think that was a utility we both should take advantage of in the next mod. I hope we get a chance to work with each other in the future. Stay classy, -Dan

## D: Professional Skills
The development of Professional Skills was one of the reasons why I was drawn to Turing over any other programs. Here at Turing, their goal is not just to create kick ass developers, but extremely employable people who also happen to be kick ass developers.

#### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
The growth mindset gear up has been the most impactful gear up session for me so far. I grew up with a fixed mindset, and have been constantly working on changing my mindset to be more growth oriented this entire mod. I have failed at times (ideabox), but mostly have taken this to heart and learned things about myself that surprise me. For instance, how much I actually enjoy getting gritty!

#### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

This gear up definitely helped me craft a better framework for how I approach projects and issues within projects. I still need to be better about timeboxing, but I feel better about maximizing my cognitive resources. I have noticed however that it is easier for me to be strict about all aspects of my life (working hard on school work and eating well) than it is for me to be gluttonous and productive. 

#### Gear Up
#### Working With Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

I found this gear up to be really interesting especially since I grouped up with all back-end introverts when I am a front-end extrovert. Extroverts like myself, often need to "talk it out" so that we are able to come to the correct conclusion, while introverts need to sit and think on the problem. It is important to recognize that people have vastly different personalities/learning styles and utilizing each individual's skills is important to making an effective team. Also, introverts hate their girlfriends (or that's what my group all said).

#### Gear Up
#### Strengths & Storytelling

Storytelling was a very intriguing topic for me. It is hard to tell your own story in a succinct way, and that is something that I have always struggled with in job interviews. However, hearing other peoples stories is an incredible way to learn more about who they are and understan where they come from. Learning others' stories leads to empathy, and empathy is crucial not just to being a better person, but also a more effective developer.

#### Gear Up
#### Debugging The Gender Gap

This gear up left me dumbfounded. The statistic of females leaving the tech industry after ten years because of "death by 1,000 cuts" was extremely disheartening. Growing up with three sisters who all happen to be incredibly smart, strong, and confident, it was crazy to hear how today men are still so oblivious to their own actions. I was also shocked by the example of the airbags being designed to protect the average man. C'mon, boys. Be better.

## E: Community Participation

To be honest, I wasn't as involved with the community in Mod 1 as I had planned to be. I did utilize pairing with Mod 2 and Dan and I went to Mod 4 to ask questions after they came into our classroom. Besides that, I went on one friday-lunch-roulette and that is about it. Next Mod I want to be available to pair with Mod 1 and join the Armstrong Posse.

### Playing a Part
In this mod, I went to every guest speaker except for one. I also spent A LOT of time in the building. My favorite thing was how great everyone in our cohort is about staying together and working through problems without judgement. I did not join a posse this mod because I was a little intimidated by the workload, but next mod I plan on joining Armstrong Posse.
