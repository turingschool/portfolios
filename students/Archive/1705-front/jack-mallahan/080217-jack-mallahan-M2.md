# Jack Mallahan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming in to Mod 2, I wanted to get really comfortable with Javascript and make a really cool game. I definitely accomplished my second goal during the Game Time project, and I feel so much more comfortable with Javascript.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I felt really great about how I did on my end of mod assessment, and was really proud to pass with flying colors!


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really enjoyed Sorting Suite, and got really fixed on solving the sorting algorithms in different ways. Complete Me wasn't my favorite project, but I did well and passed on both.

#### Sorting Suite

* [Sorting Suite Repo](https://github.com/jackmallahan/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Pass/Fail: PASS

#### Complete Me

* [Complete Me Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

##### Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
##### Instructor: Limbo
##### Comments:

###### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

###### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I thought the group projects in this mod were pretty awesome. Creating Tron is the coolest project that I can show off to friends/family and I loved getting my first experience with React. Also, Christie and David were excellent partners that helped me grow as a developer!

#### Game Time

* [Game Time Repo](https://github.com/jackmallahan/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

I built an awesome recreation of the classic TRON video game using HTML Canvas with David Becker.

##### Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
##### Instructor: Limbo
##### Comments:

###### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

###### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

###### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [Weathrly Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

I worked with Christie Lynam to make the friendliest darn weather app you have ever seen using React.

##### Instructor Evaluation Points:
##### Instructor: Limbo
##### Comments:

###### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React/JS. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

###### User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

###### HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

###### CSS/Sass Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

###### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

###### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

###### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Gear Up 1: Empathy

One of the reasons why I chose Turing over other coding schools is the incredible community that is built here. Coming from a Jesuit University and High School, social justice and empathy are things that I have been trained to think about for a long time. Turing, as a community, does an increidble job making everyone feel safe & welcome no matter their background or prior experiences. I am a very extroverted person, so my cohort usually knows where I stand on things. I think this provides an opportunity for me to be a beacon of social justice and empathy and make sure everyone feels loved and included.

#### Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation

I thought that this gear up was pretty interesting. It is easy to think that other people will stand up for themselves the way that I would. However, I have this privilege from being a straight, white male. It is important to never make assumptions and always ask questions.

#### Gear Up 3: Being a Newb in Tech

I liked this gear up a lot because it showed me that there are many ways that to contribute and  even being as green as I am. I thought that their ideas for contributing to an open source project were something that I will take to heart, and start doing because it not only looks great in interviews, but it gives you confidence in your own ability.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I think that I did a pretty good job of being involved in the community this mod. I became the leader of the Hamilton posse, and am running for SAB rep for next mod. I also paired with multiple people from Mod 1, 3 days a week.
