# (Hector A. Sanchez - Module 1 Portfolio)

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

(In this module I set out to learn as much as I possibly could about javascript, html, and css.  I repeated module 1 because
I felt that I needed to spend more time learning the basics. I felt that I accomplished my goal and I feel that I now have a better understandin of js, html, and css. I also set out to push myself as much as I could with everything that we do in module 1 and this will apply to the upcoming mods as well. I feel like I can push myself even harder still but overall I'm conent with how hard I've been working.)

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2
## Evaluator: Brenna
## Optional Notes:

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Arrays

* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Advanced Beginner__: Can read through a test and understand the structure. Can make the test pass, but takes a few attempts because developer does not use error messages effectively.
* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth-Mindset

This gear up was extremely helpful to me in so many ways.  The introduction of this gear up at the beginning of the module is perfect.  Coming into a new learning environment and not knowing what to expect from oneself and the overall learning process, I felt it very comforting to have been introduced to the concept of growth mindset.  I felt that I became a better person overall after this gear up and I work on myself daily to make sure that I never get stuck in a fixed mindset and always allow room for growth.

#### Getting better at difficult things

This gear up helped me realize just how important it is to tackle problems in steps.  At times I feel very frustrated whenever I'm not making the progress that I feel I should be making.  It's easy to get overwhemled and a lot harder to take a step back and anazlyze the situation and remind myself that I'm not there yet.  Keyword yet, not yet but eventually I will achieve my goal and find a solution or the understand the problem.  My key take away from this gear up session was that, the harder I make something out to be the less likely I am to follow through with it.  I have to learn how to break a huge obstacle, goal, problem into small steps that I can complete little by little until I reach my goal.

#### Working Styles

My key takeaway from this gear up session was to be more understanding of people.  During my group projects I was able to implement a lot of what we learned in this session.  I was able to communicate openly with my team memebers and at no point did we ever have any conflicting situations. 

#### Storytelling and strengths

My key takeaway from this session was that I was able to do some personal reflection about myself and what events in my life have led me on a path of becoming a software developer.  It was great to be put into a situation where I needed to tell someone else about myself and to point out what I value as a person and what my strengths are.

#### Code Debugging the gender gap

Watching the video during this gear up session was a real eye opener for me.  I never realized just how wide the gender gap is in the tech industry.  Some of the things I watched during this video really upset me, most importantly the parts where in some situations female colleagues were harassed and treated with a lack of respect.  After the group discussion that we had I gained an insight of just how beneficial it is to have a diverse set of people talking and sharing ideas.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended spike sessions and showed up to demo night to show support for Turing students.  I tried to help as many people as I could in my cohort.
