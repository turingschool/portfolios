# (Hector A. Sanchez) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

(I set out to gain a solid understanding of ES6 syntax and the React framework.  I belive I was able to accomplish this goal with the help
of my instructors who guided us and walked us through the subject matter.  I also set out to help the module 1 students by pairing with them 
and helping them with their projects.)

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### ()

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## Empathy:

From this gear up I took away the importance and value of being able to be empathetic to others and how that can aid my development as 
a software developer here at Turing and in my future career.  I feel like the better you can understand others, my ability to work 
with others successfully will greatly increase, no matter the situation.

##Feedback:

From this gear up I took away the importance of giving and receiving feedback from others.  I learned how to handle microaggressions if 
I ever feel triggered by the feedback that someone gives me.  I was also able to become more conscious of how I give feedback
to others and how to not trigger microaggressions from them.  These feedback sessions helped me realize just how useful giving feedback
can be.

##Group Think

My main take away from this gear up was that in some instances group think can be harmful.  We also discussed the importance
of having diversity in a group and how it can greatly reduce the harm that group think can create.

## Learning to fail gracefully

This gear up was very interesting and fun!  I'm training myself to use failure as a tool to learn from my mistakes and grow rather 
than to look as failure as a negative thing.  It was interesting to see how people deal with failure and I was able to take away
things that I found useful.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(Made myself available for pairing.  It was a pleasure to be able to help the mod 1 students with their projects.  I attended demo night
to show support for the upper mod students.)
