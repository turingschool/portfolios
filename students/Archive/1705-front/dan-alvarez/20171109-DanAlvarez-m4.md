### Gear Up

#### Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

This Gear Up was presented by myself along with Laura, Travis and Mason. The idea was to present that nerd culture is main stream culture. The idea of being a nerd now encompasses everything. Being a nerd is now more a title associated with a deep interest in a topic, vs the traditional nerd which is someone who does not fit in and is interested in non main-stream idealogy. The next part was to show that Misogany exists in all professions and throughout all cultures. There is a problem with how our society is established and it falls onto us to be the change we need/want.
