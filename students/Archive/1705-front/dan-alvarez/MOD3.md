# Dan Alvarez - M3-FE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really learned React and Redux. I feel extremely comfortable navigating state 
and props in React, as well as props from the store in Redux. I also now feel 
a lot more comfortable with array prototypes.

I passed!


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (foodgrAder)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/foodgrAder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Create an app that will display restaurants. It will display a map with directions to the best graded one by default. The list of restaurants will be sorted from best to worst grade. The user can search for specific places or certain locations or both! 

Overall good work, still needed some fine tuning for the mvp to be an the desired mvp. It used google map, geolocation, and zomato api. Did not get to the desired bonuses of making a user profile. Or initiaing messenger.

#### Completion:

3- Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

#### Organization:

2- Developer used a project management tool but didn’t update the progress frequently. <-Updated and added the deliverables from monday 9/18 eval.

#### TDD:

1- Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage). <- Now testing all fetchs, actions and reducers, as well as minimal component testing.

#### Code Quality:

3.5-Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

#### User Experience:

3-Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

#### Performace:

3-Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.(*cough*)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I was fortunate to work with Ana during HeadCount, David during SWAPI-Box and Molly & Ralph during MovieTracker.

#### (HeadCount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/HeadCount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Make an app using react that will take in hard coded information, display each school in the information, and for each school display its year and coresponding 

Overall good work. There could be some refactoring using a component instead of repetitive html coding. As well could have used more individual functions doing one action then calling a larger function that will conditionally call ther other actions.

#### Specification Adherence: 

3 - The application completes 5 iterations

#### Code Quality: 

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation: 

Pass-Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design: 

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing: 

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

(feedback to me)


#### (SWAPI-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/SWAPI-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Make an app using react that will make an initial fetch from a starwars api. The make nested fetch calls to obtain all the information neeed. Once all the information is obtained. Display a scroll screen of the starwars movie intros. Then on a button click display characters, vehicles or plantes. Each character/vehicle/planet should be able to be favorited.

Good work, the css falls short. There could be some refactoring in the code and use of components.

#### Specification Adherence:

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations

#### Code Quality:

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### CSS/Design:

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing: 

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.


#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/movietracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Pull in information from the movie database api, display the top movies in theaters at the moment. Each movie should be represnted by its poster. A user should be able to login, once loggedin the user can add movies to their movie favorites list. When the user refreshes the page, the user should persist.

Good work, the css falls short. There could be some refactoring in the code and use of components.

#### Specification Adherence:

2(pending 3) - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Redux Architechture: 

3 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing: 

3 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

#### JavaScript Style: 

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing: 

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Worflow: 

4 - The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Ups

#### (Micro Agressions)

I took a lot away from this Gear Up. Mainly because of my part on SAB this MOD. I found out that a lot of students at turing, especially the females, are having a hard time with the way other interact and talk to them. I had some sort of idea the power micro agression have on people, as I am a minority and it happens quiet a bit to me. However it also really opened my eyes to the many instances of micro agressions that happen everyday.

#### (Group Think)

I feel that the group think Gear Up was useful in the fact that it brought more awareness of group think. However I feel that somethimes it is the group think that can help make a more harmonious environment. In the instance of Turing especially. However I feel that it is often the case in most industies that it happens too often. 


#### (The Simple Art of Not Giving A F#ck)

It was a good Gear Up. I did not find it as useful. I understood the main theme, that a person has so much 'currency' to spend. Wheather it be time, energy or actual money, each person can be drained by spending their 'currency' on things that the person does not give a f#ck about. Spending your 'currency' on just the things you care about will make you a happier person. However the lesson did not touch on the possible down falls of the concept. Alienation from friends or coworkers. Possible loss of money. Etc..

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### SAB:

I was fortunate enough to be elected by my peers to represent them in the SAB. I have tried to make sure I attend every wrap up or lesson plan so that if my constiuants need to miss for whatever reason, I will be able to inform them on the lesson or wrap up topics. As well I have been trying to take in as much information from our surveys as well as the turing wide surveys and sum it up at every retro for my people.

#### Posse Lead:

I was elected by my peers to 'lead' the Gomex Posse. This mod I was able to organize a few activites, including merging with other posses for different activities. Week 1 meet and greet we paired with another posse to help introduce more people to one another. We held a show n tell with another posse, showing off what we are proud of so far in the mod. As well another meeting we paired to go over story telling. As well I helped (barely) Lola organize some mentors to come down and do a QnA with a few posses. 

#### Reached Out to Other Mods:

I have tried to make the connection with mods 1, 2, and 3. (Can never start networking too early) But mainly I remembered how I felt during my first few weeks at turing. And one of the most calming things that happened was the introduction of MOD4 to me when I was in MOD1. It really made me feel that I could also make it through everything. I made the effort to do this with the MOD1 class.
