# (Dan Alvarez) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(The biggest things I wanted to learn this mod were canvas, for game creation, react, for better website design, and node tries for information storage purposes.)

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3 I feel the consistent feedback I am receiving is that I am thinking and problem solving correctly, however I need more practice with syntax. I make small mistakes, once they are pointed out, I completely understand why it is a mistake and how to fix it.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3, I felt I was able to apply the lessons learned to achieve the end goal, however there were areas where I could refactor my code to be cleaner. I also felt that I would focus on certain sections of my static comps, but as a result I would overlook a detail in another section.m
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3, I felt that I worked well with others, I was able to learn from them and them from me. I would say similarly to my individual projects, I would focus on certain functionality and not enough on refactoring.
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
I really enjoyed all of our gear ups. I think that everyone was very accepting of the theme of each gear up. Which really helped everyone be honest with our participation. Each lesson seems to play a huge part of our personal career development.
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4
I tried to be involved with my classmates whenever possible. Any opportunity to learn or tutor one another was crucial for my development in this mod. I would say I feel like this mod went really well. I only wish our quizes were not on the same day that our big projects are due. Also getting our scores back from our quizlettes and projects would be more helpful so we could be more aware of what we need to work on.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Passed)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I found the work in this MOD very rough but very rewarding. It wasn't always very apparent why, but the concepts we learned are very useful in coding and creating small functionality in websites that will make the user experience much better. Game Time was amazing because we got to make games! Which is a passion of mine. Sortnig Suite and Complete Me were awesome lessons hidden in hard work. I now understand nodes and trie traversal. Weatherly was a great intro into react. I really think react is going to be a great selling point when it come to finding a job outside of turing. 

### Projects

(Individual Projects)


#### (Sorting Suite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

I actually really enjoyed this project as an introduction into recurrsion. Once you grasp how recurrsion actually works, it is really cool. It was a bit of a bummer that making these algorithms won't be used in the future as sort handles ass that in JS. However I did like learning how to make a function using recurrsion. I was very proud of my quick sort even though merge sort was significantly more difficult. My quick sort was vastly superior than what anyone has ever seen ever! And the best part is, there is nothing especially that great about how it was written. It is a very efficient clean code, but it could be made more efficient. Reguadless it was very uplifting.


(From memory: I could have use more ES6 syntax to cut down on my code lenght. Parts that repeated themselves and as a result could have made come simple functions that would be easier than hard coding so much.)

(evaluation scores: PASS)



#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

I think complete me was exhausitng but rewarding. It was some how much more difficult than sorting-suite. Understanding how to traverse the node trie was really cool. Our class came together and worked through everything as a class. "No Child Left Behind". We worked through the logic as a class. We took turns teaching. I think I learned the most from this project mainly because I was asked to explain how the functions worked. That made me really understand how it worked and what was happening.

(From memory: I am a good refactor away from having a really clean code. I made a lot of repetitive areas where I hard coded functionality where I could have made functions that I could call.  )

(evaluation scores:

Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This was the project I looked forward to the most. Being paired with Nick was awesome. He was great to work with and very receptive to my ideas. We made an outline of daily goals as well as weekly goals. We both were reliable when it came to work and commitment to the project. I learned a lot from Nick as far as how to think about problems differently to make it an easier proplem to solve. I liked how we made our game have a simple foundation that made add ons easy to apply. Our concept of handling cars and trucks and lanes and logs made our game unique and smart.

(We had some areas of code that could have been made simpler with arrow functions and more ES6 syntax. We also did our testing late in the process. We also could have had some more tests to cover ecerything in our game.)

(evaluation scores: 

Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### (Weatherly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project was very draining on me. React is amazing. I find it very awesome how to create components and use them throughout the site. I feel it would have been more useful to teach react right after teaching canvas, mainly because "components and class extends super"  are very similar. I did find that I had a hard time wrapping my head around testing. 

(I now really understand why it is so important to use TDD. We had many bugs in our code that cause minor defects that made our app sub parr. These tests could have caught some of the bugs ahead of time. Also we had an issue with the complete me that we decided to import. It had a small bug in it that caused a glaring defect in out app. )

(evaluation scores: 

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript / React Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their applicatison.

Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints)



## D: Professional Skills
I felt the Professional skills taught this MOD were extrmely useful and a great first step into the tech community outside of Turing. I found my mentors to be extremely insightful and helpful with creating familiarity with me. The teaching of feedback through conversation and the Johari window was helpful and a great way to have a better understanding of the coder I project to others.

### Gear Up
#### (Empathy and Priviledge)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

The empathy and priviledge Gear Up was really great because it gave eveyone a much deeper insight into the possible connections you can make with others. Now I know that I may be priviledged compared to others in ways I haven't thought of in the past. We learned that we have to becareful on judging people before we realize that we may have had a much better upbringing.

### Gear Up
#### (Being An Ally)

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/danalvarez5280/d2357f0fd4282875ff64d1795490f75a)

The Being an Ally Gear Up was really powerful because it was a great lesson in how to practice what we preach when it comes to equal rights. We talked about how to handle situations, what to do that might work, and ways to approach the situation as not to add gas to the flames. Especially because we were paired with such random people, we got so many more points of view. 

### Gear Up
#### (Attention Economy)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1706-inning/group_two.md)

The Attention economy Gear Up was really awesome. The MOD4 students did a great job explaining what the Attention Economy is and how it effEcts all of us everyday. We were able to discuss how social media uses psycological tricks to manipulate us, much like slot machines in casinos, to keep our attention. We learned how these sites make money from ads and how that has caused these giant corporations to monopolize social media and give our information to ad companies so they can target us. It was freaky but extremely thought provocing.


## E: Community Participation

Feed Back From MOD 1 Pairing

"All of Mod2 was a phenomenal resource throughout our struggle through mod1. Dan in particular, really stood out showing his excitement, willingness and engagement when it came to pairings. He always seemed to be in a positive upbeat mood and willing to go the extra mile to solve issues that we had. Although I didn't have as many pairings with him as some others, usually do to the fact that he was booked up, my time with him was well spent and conducive to my learning (even though he broke my repo through GitHub the fist pairing, haha).

I appreciated the approach Dan took through pairing. Testing our knowledge and redirecting our train of thought or having us question/explain our own. A real pleasure to have as a resource, I appreciated all the help that he provided. Hopefully, I'll be able to provide the same support to mods below me as I progress through Turing. Thanks a lot!" 

-Sam Singer


"Over the course of my first mod I had the opportunity to pair with Dan on two occasions. In these sessions I appreciated Dan’s ability to clearly explain the macro-level processes of the coding components we were working with. In my most recent pairing with Dan I asked him to give me his own big-picture explanation of constructor functions, in general, and their role in the various mythical creatures exercises which were giving me quite a bit of trouble at the time. I don’t think these types of broad, conceptual questions come up a whole lot in these pairing sessions, as most of the time, at least in my experience, they’re focused on discrete tasks. That said, Dan provided a thorough answer that really helped me turn a corner in my understanding of constructor functions. Dan’s ability to explain the bigger picture of coding is a strength of his I recall throughout both of our coding sessions. I think one area where Dan could slightly improve is in helping his pair-ees work through the smaller, nuanced pieces of code and why their code might be having issues. Being able to help his pair-ees really nail down the discrete pieces of their coding approach that might be causing them problems would make him an even stronger pairing partner than he already is."
 
 -Luke finney
 
 
"There’s definitely a reason I continually scheduled pairings with you, Dan. You are easy to understand, and you enjoy highlighting what your partner/student is doing well. You have an easy-going nature that I instantly felt comfortable with. You never made me feel like I was slow or stupid. Also, if you had worked on my problem for a bit and didn’t feel like you were wrapping your head around it, you were quick to consult other people in your mod. I definitely appreciate your willingness to admit what you don’t know. The only thing I might suggest you do differently is not giving away answers as quickly. Occasionally, it felt like you would get a bit frustrated with giving hints and eventually just tell me how it’s done. In the future, I’d like a bit more time to play around in the safety net of hints and guidance before you give all your secrets away. These instances were, however, very occasional and very minor. You were a delight to work with, and I look forward to more pairings with you in the future."

-Lola Brenner


"Pairing with you was great. You are good at explaining things in multiple ways and didn't just give me the answers without making me think. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to help me and the rest of mod1. You gave me a much better understanding of mythical creatures that I will be taking into the eval with me. Thanks dude!"

-Jason Hughes


"Thank you so much for taking the time to pair with so many of us and lead a Mythical Creatures session, Dan! During our pairing, you made me feel comfortable to ask questions because you are so friendly and kept a positive tone even when it was probably frustrating that I took so long to get on board with what you were talking about! You are good at explaining things, but still pushed me to do a lot of thinking so I was able to take away true learning, not just finishing a part of a project.  You’re awesome."

-Amy Holt


"Dear Dan,

I couldn't be more thankful to you for meeting with me so many times. Your knowledge in CSS is very helpful and impressive. I feel very comfortable with you because you are extremely friendly and kind; this allowed me to not hold back asking question. I am now good at CSS, and you are a big part of it. I don't know what you could have done better because you went above and beyond to help me and my classmates. If anything, continue to be as you are because it pushes people to grow as developers."

-Jorge Ed PerezGa



### Playing a Part

(In this Mod I tried to be more involved in Gear Ups and my Posse. I took on the leadership role of the Gomez Posse and decided to run for SAB. I think Turing is so amazing and has provided such an wonderful community. I decided that giving back would be a great way to pay it forward. I have also volunteered to speak at a High School with Ellen Mary in September about coding. When we as a class decided to go through Complete-Me I volenteered to run a few sessions, not because I was confident in my answers, but becasue I knew that my class needed someone to drive on the giant monitors and show them we all are struggling and its okay to be lost at times.)
