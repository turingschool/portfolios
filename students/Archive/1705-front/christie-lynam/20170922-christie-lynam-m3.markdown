## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED
Scored all 3s

## B. Individual Work & Projects

I did my self-directed project with Margo Schaedel... see below (Do You)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount

* [Headcount Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Margo Schaedel

##### Instructor: Brittany

###### Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Code Quality

* 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

###### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

###### CSS/Design

* 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

###### Testing

* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested.

###### Surprise and Delight

* 4 - Unicorn

#### SWapi-Box

* [SWapi-Box Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Travis Rollins

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

###### Code Quality

* 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design

* 3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### MovieTracker

* [MovieTracker Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

##### Students: Christie Lynam, Nick Svetnicka and Nik Bornemeier

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

###### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

###### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### Do You

* [Do You Frontend Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you)
* [Do You Backend Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you-postgres)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Margo Schaedel

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)

###### Feature Delivery

1. Completion

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

2. Organization

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

###### Technical Quality

1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

2. Code Quality

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

###### Product Experience

1. User Experience

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

2. Performance

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Gear Up 1: Microaggressions

Microaggressions can be verbal or non-verbal behaviors that insult or offend a certain demographic. Most of the time, they are dispensed unintentionally which results in most people just blowing them off. I have been a victim of microaggressions, and I also realize that I have dispensed them unknowingly. The biggest thing I took away from this gear up is the importance of talking about these issues and not pushing them aside just because they may have been done/said unintentionally.   

#### Gear Up 2: Groupthink

Groupthink (or follow the leader) takes place in almost every aspect of life... politics, legal system, sports, and the list goes on. However, good leadership, diversity, and building an intellectually credible process are principles that can be applied to avoid the narrow mindedness of groupthink. As a general rule, you should question, verify, validate, and evaluate the risk of everything. If you don't, you could be missing out on coming up with the next best thing or idea that could make the world a better place.

#### Gear Up 3: The not so subtle art of not giving a fuck

I chose this gear up because I feel like this became my life motto about 2 years ago. I was tired of doing things I didn't want to do... certain social engagements, practicing law, etc. I told myself I was going to start saying no to the things that did not bring me happiness and give more fucks to the things that did. That lead me to Turing.... where I feel like all my fucks are currently being given to becoming the best developer I can be. I hope to be able to spread them out a little more in the near future when I get back out into the real world.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This was an extremely difficult mod for me and I feel like I was not emotionally or mentally available to give back and participate in the Turing community as much as I would have liked and have in previous mods. I hope to better at this in Mod 4.
