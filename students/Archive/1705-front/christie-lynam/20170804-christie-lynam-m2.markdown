# Christie Lynam - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this mod included having a solid understanding of objects and arrays and improving my array prototype skills. I also wanted to leave this mod with a healthy base level understanding of React that I can build upon in Mod 3. It was also really important to me to give back to the community all that had been given to me thus far. I really enjoyed getting to know everyone in Mod 1 and supporting them academically and emotionally.

##### Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
##### Instructor: Nathaniel
##### Comments:

###### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I really enjoyed my 2 group projects this mod... I had awesome partners and learned a lot about HTML Canvas and React.

#### Game Time

* [Game Time Repo](https://github.com/jbexx/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

I worked with Jonathan Beckman to re-create the arcade game Galaga using HTML Canvas.

##### Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
##### Instructor: Limbo
##### Comments:

###### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

###### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

###### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Gear Up 1: Empathy

I think Turing does a great job of providing an environment where people feel safe & welcome no matter their background or prior experiences. As an individual, I can work on being a little more extroverted and getting to know my cohort and community better. I love being alone and working alone, but I also recognize that this can sometimes alienate me from the rest of the group. Because of this, others are probable less willing to open up and share their experiences with me. And this is crucial in the process of becoming more empathetic.

#### Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation

When reflecting on what it takes to be an ally at Turing, a few things come to mind. Probably most important, ask questions! Try understanding why others feel the way they do. Don't attack others when trying when attempting to be an ally for a particular group or person. Offer another thought process without attacking. And LISTEN!

#### Gear Up 3: Being a Newb in Tech

There are numerous ways that one can contribute and give back to the community even being a tech newbie. While still at Turing, you can mentor lower mod students, lead a spike, and even start contributing to open source projects. You know more than you think you know and you are absolutely qualified to give back!


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This was my second mod to serve as my cohort's SAB representative. I also took a leadership role in organizing and encouraging pairings between Mod 1 and Mod 2. I am including feedback from 3 individuals that I paired with on multiple occasions this mod.

#### Feedback from Sam Singer

  Thank you Christie! Let's begin with the facts. I can't comprehend how previous mods before us got through this process without having an upper mod as an immediate and helpful resource through these later projects. With that being said, Christie was an awesome fountain of knowledge! She was incredibly efficient with time management and understood the importance of maximizing and utilizing the pairing sessions. She also was able to provide great insight and a knowledge base when we were completely lost at times redirecting our focus in the correct manner.

  During pairing sessions, I appreciated Christie's approach by letting us steer the session but would correct our course if need be. This was definitely helpful for the learning process going through the material, instead of serving us the answers every time. She also made the pairing sessions non-intimidating and helpful by always bringing an upbeat pleasant attitude.

  Your time and company was much appreciated! I only hope I'm able to return and pass down the favor when my time comes.

#### Feedback from Francy Lang

  - You were a very good teacher:
      - You asked questions, instead of just giving answers.
      - You coached me towards solutions.
      - You provided sufficient wait time after guiding questions, before immediately giving me another hint- this allowed me processing time.
      - You never took over, in general, I was always the "driver."

  - You made yourself available and never made me feel like I was wasting your time or asking "dumb" questions.
  - I felt comfortable enough to ask "dumb" questions.
  - You stayed calm, and provided a safe environment that made it possible to learn.
  - Out of all my pairing sessions, you were the best about adapting to my logic. Meaning, that if the way I was doing something would work, you supported me in developing that logic, instead of trying to get me to do it the way that you had done it.

#### Feedback from Amy Holt

  Christie, I can't thank you enough for all the pairing sessions you led! You were incredibly generous with your time. You are a really great teacher in that setting because you make it feel like we're partners in solving a problem. You don't give the answer, but help us get there. You also explain things at a pace that is reasonable and adjust if we look confused.
