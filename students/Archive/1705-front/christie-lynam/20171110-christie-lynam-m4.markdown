# Christie Lynam - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for Mod 4 was to have a good understanding of how to create a fully functioning application, FE and BE, and being able to deploy it to production.
My other goals included graduating and getting a job. I am super excited that I have accomplished all of these goals!

Evaluation by Brittany...

##### Specification Adherence

**60 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### User Interface

**11 points**: The application shows effort in the interface. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

##### Data Persistence with SQL Database

**20 points**: The application persists data in a SQL database with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

##### Testing

**15 points**: Project has a running test suite that tests every server-side endpoint, but some assertions are commented out or failing

##### Commented Server File

**8 points**: Each line of the server file (on a separate branch) is commented and explains the code using mostly precise, correct terminology and specificity

##### JavaScript Style

**17 points**: Application is thoughtfully put together with minor duplication, no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

**15 points**: Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

##### To get a 3 on this project, you need to score 120 points or higher
##### To get a 4 on this project, you need to score 140 points or higher

#### Final Score: 146 / 160

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I continued to mentor and support a couple of the Mod 3 students, helping them with projects, improving their resumes, and assisting with drafting emails to connect with others in the industry.
I also contributed by leading a Gear Up in week 5 on the importance of not taking yourself too seriously.
Additionally, I volunteered to TA at a Try Coding event.
I'm excited to continue contributing to the Turing community by staying on as a TA post graduation!
