# Ana Jauregui  - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

* My goals for Mod 2 were to build a stronger foundation of my skills with Javascript, and get more comfortable with OOP and manipulation of data involving objects and arrays. Additionally I was seeking a base foundation of React and hoping to have a deeper understanding of TDD and how to successfully guide my development of future projects through testing. It was also important for me to continue to build relationships with my cohort peers through working collaboratively and learning what I can from them. 

### Self-Evaluation Rubric Scores:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
* Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Project: Sorting-Suite
https://github.com/anajauregui/Sorting-suite
#### Evaluating Instuctor: Nathaniel
#### Score: 
 * Pass
 * This was an individual project with a goal of understanding and implementing different sorting algorithms. The project was scored as pass or fail based on being able to successfully explain code base and how each of the assigned sorting algorithms work.

### Project: Complete-me
https://github.com/anajauregui/Complete-Me
#### Instructor: Limbo

#### Scores:
#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Project: Game Time
https://github.com/Kalikoze/Game-Time
#### Instructor: Meeka

#### Scores:
#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

Make sure button to reset matches style

Need some stylistic indication of the win and loss to drag the eye to it

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Project: Weatherly
https://github.com/anajauregui/Weatherly
#### Instructor: Limbo
#### Scores:

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React/JS. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

3.5 - Five or fewer complaints

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up Reflections:

#### 1) Empathy:
  * This session really made me think about the Turing community as a whole, and how diverse a group we really are. No matter the background and experiences that we all have each one of us being empathetic towards one another and really working through struggles together makes a strong impact on our academic outcomes. Empathy happens to be be one of my strengths that was highlighted in our previous strengths finder session, and while I find this to be true in my everyday life, while at Turing sometimes I find that being so busy and consumed with current struggles related to school and personal life can get in the way of me really being able to open up and allow for that empathy to play a part in my encounters with other members of the Turing community. This is something I would like to stay in tune with and continue to work on. 

#### 2) Parable of the Polygon/Automation -- Allyship:
  * Reflecting on being an ally to others makes me think of the importance of keeping an open mind and really hear others. Taking the time to listen with a goal of understanding. It is easy to hear others, but it takes communication and dialouge to understand someones stance and intent. At the same time, although it is something I have not always done in every situation, I do believe it is important to have a say in what you feel your stance is, even if you do not think others will receieve it in the way you wish.  

#### 3) The Attention Economy:
  * This session made me think hard about how much is controlled through technology and how powerful it is to have all these sources at our fingertips to stay in touch and in the know, but it also hinders us from being in the moment to some extent. Some are more vulnerable to the "attention economy" than others, but in some way whether we opt-in or out, it affects us all. It found it to be a very relevant and important topic of conversation, especially as a new developer. It is important to keep in mind how we will want to make an impact in others lives through what we will develop, and what role we will play. 

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

#### Playing a Part

* Throughout the Mod I have made an effort to participate in as many community groups and sessions as I could make time for and engange with my peers to make the most out of my experience at Turing. I have also made it a point to help other students in Mod 1 when I could be of assistance to them. 


# Outcome
