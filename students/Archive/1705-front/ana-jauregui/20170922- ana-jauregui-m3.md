# Ana Jauregui  - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

* My goals for Mod 3 were to get a solid understanding of React while
incorporating Redux and Router. Gaining a strong foundation for dealing with
local state of an application vs store with Redux, as well as gaining a better
understanding of how to architect and plan out the structure of an application
in a scalable manner. I also set out to get more comfortable breaking problems
into smaller - easier to solve chunks, and get a better understanding of
Functional Programming vs Object Oriented paradigms. Overall, I was able to
achieve these goals and can say that I have experienced great growth in my own
skills and confidence level with programming which has been a continuous
struggle for me throughout my time at Turing.

## D: Community

### Gear Up Reflections:

#### 1) Microaggressions:

  * This gear up really brought up great conversation amongst the group, microaggressions often go un-discussed they can be intentional but most often seem to be unintentional. Nonetheless, even if they are unintentional it does not make them any more acceptable by the receiver. I realized throughout this gear up how I have been a victim to microaggressions as well as gaining a perspective of how I have distributed microaggressions towards others unknowingly in the past. The discussions made me more aware of how to recognize and address the issues and hopefully be more mindful to make sure I do not dispense microagressions to others in the future.

#### 2) Groupthink:

  * Groupthink is prevalent throughout society, it is hard to avoid especially when you are part of a group that spends a great amount of time together. It is important to be aware of groupthink, its faults and how it can in some instances create good. Groupthink situations can be avoided by having inclusivity within a group allowing for diversity and different backgrounds to really play a roll within groups.

#### 3) Failing Gracefully:

  * This gear up was a great reminder of how much fear of failure can be a hinderance to attempt to set and achieve big goals. It is important to have a healthy outlook of failure, be able to accept it and learn from it. I appreciated acknowledging how my time at Turing has made me less afraid and more accepting of failure, although I would say I still have a long way to go to have a more healthy relationship with failure. Being amongst a community of people all dealing with failure and successes in the same way that I am has been helpful in my growth of learning to accept failure.
