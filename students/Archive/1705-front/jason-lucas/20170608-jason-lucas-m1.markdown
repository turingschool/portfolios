* __Proficient:__ Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Design Concepts

* __Proficient__: Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.

Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension
* __Advanced Beginner__: Can read through a test and understand the structure. Can make the test pass, but takes a few attempts because developer does not use error messages effectively.
* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

I can't really grade this category for this particular project with this rubric because the final implementation used the comp as, ahem, "inspiration" rather an a guide. It was  very funny and clever, but not very usable. It *was* responsive, which is awesome.

#### Comp Recreation

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Link List)

* [Link List](https://github.com/jackmallahan/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

With a little jQuery under your belt, it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:

Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)


### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I found the this gear up very helpful for me through my time at Turing.  Learning coding is a far departure from my background and I constantly found myself wondering if I was capable of learning coding.  This gear up gave me some tools to shift from the fixed mindset.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This helped me recognize when I am dedicating too much time to being stuck in a process.  It gave me good insight to taking an approach to small tasks as opposed to trying to tackle the whole problem.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

This gave great insight into building with the user in mind as opposed to only yourself.  The information regarding coding class in highschools is very disappointing and alarming.  Coding class is not applied as credit towards your diploma and only two States have certification standards for teachers on this subject.  The womens stories of mistreatment in school and in the work place was upsetting and came as a suprise to me for this industry.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I helped other Mod1 1705 students out with their projects.  I helped Mod2 students out with CSS problems on their projects.


##  Pairing Feedback

### Linked-list

Hey Jason, I really enjoyed working on Linked-List with you. You were the ideal partner to have for a first paired project. You did a great job of coaching me when my jQuery knowledge was solely from watching videos and reading ahead in the lesson plan without any experience actually using it. You went at a great pace and did an awesome job of always checking in with me to make sure I understood what was going on, and when I was confused you did a great job of explaining what/why we should implement the code that way. I feel like I picked up everything we were doing pretty quickly, so you might need to be mindful in the future if your partners aren't picking things up as quickly. I really liked how you always make a list of our goals for each session so that our time together was very defined and efficient. Your suggestion that we switch off driving after every goal was completed really helped to prove that we both understood what was going on with our project and gave both of us ownership. Thanks for making me slow down and explain things to try to correct my habit of just getting things down or deleting things too quickly when I am the driver. Working with you definitely made me a better programmer and partner for future projects.


### Idea Box

Working with Jason really helped me better understand workflow through his step by step method of using console.log and taking notes. I also appreciated how he drew out everything beforehand. I probably have benefited more in working with him than anyone else and really appreciate that.  As far as coaching feedback, I really don't have any worthy of note.  Jason really knows his stuff.


### 2 Do Pivot Box

Jason, thanks for making collaboration a breeze! This project went so smoothly and I felt confident divvying up the work with you; you were dependable and delivered your code quickly - I really felt like I could trust you to get the job done, and I appreciated not having that stress. I don't think I got the chance to thank you for teaching me more about the toggleClass method and how it applied to our completed task functionality. Nothing in particular stands out to me for areas of improvement - it felt like we both met each other's expectations for this project and had equal opportunity to contribute and learn. Perhaps another partner would like more face-to-face pair work, but I felt the style of collaboration for this project was perfect and I felt comfortable how we approached it. I look forward to working with you again!
