## A: End of Module Assessment

I haven't heard.  I think I'm good?


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Things that I did in Mod 2 by myself.

A trie is a data structure in computer science. The word trie is derived from the word retrieval (as in re-trie-val). So catchy ðŸ¤“!

Now there are many types of tries and one you will hear a lot about is the binary search trie. Itâ€™s like a linked list the only difference is that each node has a left and right node attached to it.

The benefits of something like a trie is that it makes dealing with large sets of data easier to handle.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
# Instructor: Nathaniel Foster
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.





## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Things that I did in Mod 2 with another person.

# Game Time

* [Game Time: Snakes On A Plane(featuring Mr. Robbie J)](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/game-time)
* [Original Game Time Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Build a game that is playable in the browser using HTML Canvas.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: Limbo
# Comments:

## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints


# Weathrly

* [Weathrly(featuring The Carpenters)](https://github.com/mollyfoz/weathrly)
* [Weathrly](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Build a weather app with an API call.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Weathrly
# Instructor: Limbo
# Comments:

## Functional Expectations

* Extensions: 3
* UI: 3.5
* HTML: 3.5
* CSS: 4
* React Style: 3
* Testing: 3.5
* Workflow: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

Comments:  This code has changed the way that I view programming as a professional developer...  It changed my life and could
one day build the foundation for saving North Korea.  Thank you sir.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Being an ally

* [Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

This gear up session helped me explore scenerios where in which I might not have recognized or acted on the 
opprotunity to be an ally to someone that was being discriminated against.

### Gear Up
#### Empathy and Privilege

* [empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I learned about how easy it is to be unaware of your own privledge.  One big take away I had was "You studied the culture of your 
ancestors in elementary school."   I never thought about how it may feel to be the minority or the only one in a class room
whos ancestors culture was not reviewd or perhaps not reviewed in a good light.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Pairing with Mod 1

Samuel Singer

Working with Jason during pairings was very helpful. He took the time to understand where I was getting hung up and 
explained it in the simplest approach possible. That really helped, since my learning style is very systematic. 
if I don't understand one piece of the approach then I usually don't grasp the entire picture very well. 
Thanks for the pairing sessions!

Jason Hughes 

Thanks for all your help during our pairing! You made sense of mythical creatures for me that I took into my eval. 
You did a great job at making me think about what we were doing instead of just giving me the answers. 
I really appreciate it.
