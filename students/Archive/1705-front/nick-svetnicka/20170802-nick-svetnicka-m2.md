# Nick Svetnicka - M2/FE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> With an established career in software development, I entered Turing with the intention of reinforcing the building blocks, expand into newer technologies/tools, but also to surround myself in a creative and collaborative learning environment as I transition into the next stage of my career. My focus for Mod 2 was to continue supporting my fellow cohort students by serving on SAB, and assisting with the organization of group study sessions. I also wanted to enhance by JavaScript skills by learning the ES 6 syntax. Lastly, I wanted to begin emerging into the MVC frameworks, specificity with React. Overall, I am satisfied with my engagement within the community and cohort, and feel proud of the projects completed this mod.

### Project Partner

> David Becker

### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript / React Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Gear Up's


#### Privilege and Marginalization

> Make no assumptions on who someone is or what they value based on how they look, who they associate with, or how they grew up. Many of these factors are beyond their control to change, and should not reflect the type of person they grew into. I found it interesting discussing the topic of introverts/extroverts as it relates to being privileged. It’s important not to make assumptions about someone’s level of understanding or comprehension of the material based on their contributions to group discussions, or whether they’re raising questions.

-----------------------

#### Being An Ally

> I found this to be a very valuable gear up, as it forced me to learn and understand that even though I may not have experienced indifferences or struggles relating or working with peers, it's important to realize that even in this emerging tech world, this issue exists. I do believe however, that through the acceptance of everyone, and the general movement in our culture to accept differences and embrace what makes us unique, we are making strong improvements in this area. This gear-up I think out of all inspired our cohort to have discussions around this topic, as we all enrolled at Turing with the notion that we want to give support and also receive support from our peers.

-----------------------

#### Community Gear-Up: Attention Economy

> This was a fascinating gear-up, where we learned that in the age we live in, it's not information that's valuable anymore. It's the attention that information gets. The views, the likes, the upvotes. It's getting people to just view your content, because there is so much out there to view. It was really interesting having group discussions in the gear-up to discuss what direction companies should take to remain ethical and to offer quality content. As there are several benefits to living in this attention economy, it's important to emerge as a developer in this space who encourages companies to head in the right direction.

-----------------------


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

> One goal I had for attending Turing in general was to immerse myself in a collaborative environment where I can assist and benefit from the community as I continue on this path of Professional development. To this extent, I continued my Participation in the Student Advisory Board.

> I also received alot of help from the mod ahead of mine when I was just starting out at Turing, and wanted to continue this tradition. I organized an after-hours study session for the new mod1 students which was received well and hopefully inspires those students to pay it forward. To assist my fellow cohort students, I made an effort to organize and lead several group study sessions, and to offer my services 1-on-1 whenever I saw someone struggling with a concept.

### 1-on-1 Pairings with Mod 1

> Each week I made myself available for several pairing sessions in which students could sign up to review code or discuss concepts.

#### Pairing Feedback:

> Nick is the best! You are the most patient person on the planet, and very good at explaining things in an approachable way without dumbing them down. You also seem to have quite an eye for details. Even outside of pairings, you would catch small errors that other people had difficulty pinpointing. You also never gave away the answer too quickly, and were excellent at guiding me in the right direction without being too obvious. As for coaching feedback… I’m not sure where to suggest you have room for improvement. I think I only paired with you twice, so I may not have had enough exposure to recognize any areas of growth you may have. You were a delight to work with, and I look forward to more pairings with you in the future.

-------------

> Nick, thank you for taking so much of your time to pair with us and lead those Mythical Creatures session! I loved pairing with you because you know SO much and understand the concepts at such a deep level, but you don’t overwhelm me by that. You did a good job of asking questions about what I knew in each area before diving into explaining something, so make sure you didn’t repeat things I knew or talk way over my head. You were patient and positive, and I truly learned a lot from the times I got to work with you. Thank you!!

---------------

> Nick was extremely helpful in all of the pairings i had with him. he was able to help with 100% of the problems i was stuck on and spent over an hour with me on more than one occasion. would pair again!

----------------

> Over the course of mod1, I paired with Nick on a couple of occasions. What I most appreciated about Nick as a pairing partner was that the first step he took in helping me and my partners with a particular problem was to first understand what our approach was. In all instances when I paired with Nick he also followed up with me on whatever it had been that we were working to ensure I had definitely solved whatever problem it was we had worked on.
