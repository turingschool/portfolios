# Nick Svetnicka - M3/FE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

 My focus for this module was to continue supporting my cohort and the 
 community in their learning process, while also furthering my own 
 understanding of front-end technologies and tools. Specifically, I wanted to 
 fully embrace React, as it's likely I will be focusing on the React stack of 
 technologies once I graduate from Turing. For this reason, I put forth 
 efforts to learn various architectural setups within React/Redux. I also 
 focused on complex Routes in my final personal project of the inning. 
 Overall, I am satisfied with my engagement within the community and cohort, 
 and feel proud of the projects completed this mod.

## C: Group Work & Projects

-----------------------

### SWAPIbox

* [GitHub Project URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

#### Project Partner
> Ralph Burnette

#### Evaluator: YUNG-Jhun

#### Specification Adherence

**3** - The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

**3** - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

**3** - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

**3.5** - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

-----------------------

### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub Project URL](https://github.com/christielynam/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

#### Project Partners
> Christie Lynam
> Nik Bornemeier

#### Evaluator: YUNG-Jhun

#### Specification Adherence

**4**: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture

**3.5**: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing

**4**: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### JavaScript Style

**3**: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

**3**: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

**4**: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Gear Up's

#### Micro-Agressions

> Refers to an action, comment or situation that is hurtful specifically to a marginalized (subset) group., but delivered so casually that it’s not called out as offensive. They often emerge in the midst of good intentions.

> Because I’m a white male, I’m in the group that likely experiences the least amount of micro aggressions. And I believe this to be true. However, I am an identical twin…and often have experiences which leave me uncomfortable because of that. For instance, I’m always associated as ‘the twin’, and not an individual.  To address microagressions...sometimes I’ll step in to not really correct the way someone said it, but maybe paraphrase it in a way that allows the aggression to be minimized.

#### Group Think

> https://gist.github.com/EndlessHypnosis/385163533cfe5d829f322e85c597bed1

#### Professional Storytelling

> Our story should start with who we are - a developer, teammate, career changer. Then, why are you here - why are you a software developer. Lastly, what’s next - where do you see yourself going.

> Stories should be more about why’s and how’s, not just the whats. What drove you to career changes. Should show a lot of interest in the direction your going. A good story should have some conflict and how you overcame it.

#### The Psych of UX/UI

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

> Although I transitioned out of SAB this inning, I still wanted to continue having a positive impact on the community. Specifically, I wanted to provide mentoring assisstance to students in my cohort and the cohort behind us. Also, with a continued interest in offering my services to each new front-end student at Turing, I and Dan Alvarez introduced ourselves to the mod1 cohort, and made sure they knew our mod was available for support. Several times throughout the inning, I made an effort to reach out during times of increased stress to see what I could do to help reduce stress levels for my fellow students.
