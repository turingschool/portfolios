# Nick Svetnicka - M1/FE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> With an established career in software development, I entered Turing with the intention of reinforcing the building blocks, expand into newer technologies/tools, but also to surround myself in a creative and collaborative learning environment as I transition into the next stage of my career. My focus for Mod 1 was to ensure that the fundamentals of development and design become second nature to me. I also wanted to begin making a name for myself not only in my cohort, but within the community in general. Overall, I feel like I have made a great choice in joining the FE program at Turing, and have been satisfied with the amount of engagement I've had with the school thus far.

##### Project Partner

##### Pairing Feedback

> Nick, you were a joy to work with and I really appreciated your patience and expertise during this project! You were always conscientious whenever I needed a few minutes to wrap my head around how our code worked - there were many functions talking to each other and it was helpful to have that time to review what each piece was doing. You went the extra mile by taking the time to guide me through the steps of building out our array! There were many steps to this project, and I felt like we were on the same page in terms of work style and schedule, which made collaborating with you a breeze. I think you do a great job coaching and guiding people to solutions whenever they feel stuck; you never told me what I should do when I was stuck - you instead asked me questions so I could find the solution myself, and with someone with less experience in JavaScript, I truly appreciated this. When we met with our mentor, I communicated that I was a little uncomfortable with the lines of code you had been working on alone to add to our project, and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to follow the direction you were going, but you did a great job after our meeting to explain your ideas so we could steer our project to completion. You did well communicating your ideas, and I would suggest making time with your partner before meeting with a mentor to explain your code so that your partner can review it too before meeting with a mentor. This could help them to follow along during the session a little better too. I feel like I learned a lot working on this project with you. Thank you for pairing so well with me!

Ideas can be edited in place, and also deleted.

##### Evaluation Comments

> Worked well together, paired most of the project. Nicely done HTML and CSS, solid implementation. ideaBuilder, the Mega Function! Have some functions that are pretty long, could use a refactor pass to make things a bit more concise. In a great place to dig in and refactor.

##### Pairing Feedback

> Nick, I had a great learning experience being paired with you for idea box. I appreciate that you were accepting of my skill level while working on the JavaScript throughout the process. It was helpful to me that you allowed me to drive while you navigated in a way that still allowed me to be a part of the thought process and making our project come together. I found it easy to work with you around my time schedule which also made the process less stressful. I do suggest that you continue to vocalize your great ideas and strategies for tackling problems with your next pairing project like you did when suggesting that I break off to work on button functionality and you worked on editing content. We probably could have both done a better job with writing down exactly what we hoped to accomplish during each session of work we had, although I was pleased with how our work flow went. Thanks for the great pairing experience!

##### Project Partner

> Christie Lynam

##### Pairing Feedback

> I really enjoyed working with you on 2DoBox. You definitely brought a fresh approach and great ideas to the table that resulted in a great learning experience for me. I enjoyed stepping out of the box and exploring new ways of doing things (like the data-roles) that we had not necessarily learned in class. I felt like we had a great work flow. We were able to accomplish a lot working together, but also gave each other the freedom to work on things independently. You were great about explaining everything you did solo when we got back together before we moved on to anything else. I also felt like using GitHub Issues was helpful in keeping track of where we were and how to best divide up responsibilities. This was a great opportunity for both of us to challenge ourselves a bit and try new things, but I think its important for both of us to remember that this will not always be the case in paired projects and that forward approach could be intimidating to some. When this happens, I think its important to slow things down and make sure your partner is comfortable with the pace of things. Overall,  this was a great pairing experience for me and I was super proud of the project that we turned in. Thank you!!

## D: Professional Skills


### DTR - Define The Relationship

* [DTR Submission](https://gist.github.com/EndlessHypnosis/169a5ffeab42610eacf023cfc0ee4ea8)

-----------------------

### Gear Up's


#### Growth Mindset

> This gear up was definitely my favorite, as it enforces a concept that is easy grasp, difficult to master. Especially living in our current world, where the idea of personal growth is ever changing. Throughout this mod, I have consciously worked to improve my learning style, and to extend my support to my cohort mates.

-----------------------

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

> What stuck with me in this gear up was the simple concept of high quantity of high quality work. And that as with programming as well as most obstacles in life, splitting work into smaller components helps disect the problem, and understand it's parts. Lastly, I came away from this gear up really understanding that as with other resources, our cognative abilities are limited just the same.

-----------------------

#### Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

> Being an introvert, I learned more about how extroverts not only think, but approach situations. It was really interesting having the group split up and then mixed. This helped bring in many view points from both sides. I've learned from this gear up that as an introvert, in order to connect more with extroverts, I need to be more assertive, direct, and do more of the initiating.

-----------------------

#### Strengths and Storytelling

> As with any career, being able to sell yourself, and your story is just as important as demonstrating your abilities. This breaks down into being confident in who you are, what your background is, and how that background has helped shape who you will be going forward. Actualizing a story really forced me to reflect upon not only creating an image for myself, but also to live that image.

-----------------------

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

> Going into this gear up, and hearing that we would be watching a video, I was a bit hesitant at first. Most videos around equality that I've seen are very bland. This video however was not! It was actually pretty enjoyable to watch, and really hit on some key issues with gender equality in this field. While many of the women in the video expressed personal hardships when in the workforce, I do think the trend is changing, and I believe it starts with early education. And not just for girls, but boys as well. They need to understand that no matter what the stigma is behind a hobby, an interest, or a career, no one should make you think you're not good enough, or that you won't fit in. Because everyone is welcome to the wonderful world of coding!

-----------------------


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

> One goal I had for attending Turing in general was to immerse myself in a collaborative environment. I wanted to start out Mod 1 strong in this regard by opening myself up to providing coding guidance and assistance to my cohort. I feel as though I achieved this by working closely with my project partners on learning and reviewing concepts, and in general assisting the cohort with their needs.

> I also had the privilege of being elected for the Student Advisory Board. I was thrilled to receive the nomination, to represent our cohort in the community, and to address any needs they may have. I am looking forward to serving on this board next mod, and to contribute any way I can to help maintain such a strong and wonderful community.
