# Travis Rollins - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to really get a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  While I understood a bit of HTML and CSS, I had absolutely no understanding of Javascript before this.  It was my goal to understand the logic of how the languages worked, and I felt like I really accomplished that goal.  I also was really interested in working with partners and getting some experience of what it is like to work in this profession.  It was a good experience doing projects together and working off of other people's code.

Travis, overall, was an excellent partner to be paired with. We got along very well, and really without a huge amount of effort, were able to complete the project with a level of quality we both were very pleased with. He was very easy to make plans with, and was motivated to work. Would definitely like to be paired again in the future. If I had to come up with some coaching feedback for Travis (which I do), it would be to do everything he could to get down all the various keyboard shortcuts for OSX. But really, I was beyond satisfied with the experience.

## Feedback

Dear Travis, I thought we worked extremely well together. From the moment we sat down and did our DTR, I thought we were on the same page about everything. We both had a lot of input on the jquery. You made the process go by a lot faster by making the foundations of the jquery simple and understandable. I know that it was annoying that I stuck with the counter technique even though it was hard to understand and eventually caused us a bit more work in the end. I appreciate your patience as well as your flexibility with me in the project. Schedule wise we were on the same page, and you were extremely accommodating with working around the Static Comp project. I hope we get a chance to work together in the future as I felt our skillsets complimented each other. I thought that we both stayed positive even when we both were extremely frustrated at times. I cannot find one bad thing about this project. Other than the fact that I made the counter into a confusing mess on the page. Thanks again for making the process smooth and easy. I wish you the best in the next project. -Dan Alvarez

|Proficient         | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |


## Feedback

Travis was a great partner who possessed a great deal of patience as I was sick at the beginning of the project. Travis was definitely focused on making it through all phases of the project, whereas I was content to have a firm stopping point. I really admire the go far at all costs attitude, it was inspiring. Our approach was a side by side navigator driver approach which I felt was collaborative and helpful. We talked through our code, solutions, and why or how something wouldn't work. Travis was really open to trying new things with the code. During our project I also lost my lightning talk and had to redo it. Travis again, was super accommodating and empathetic and gave leniency so I could work on that. I felt very bad as I didn't feel I was giving equity to the time and input on this project the way he was. Travis definitely has strong ideas and when his mind is set it's set. That is a wonderful quality, I do think in a project if you both make a committed goal, then it should be honored. After we'd separated Travis sent me a message later saying he worked through the rest of the functionality and would show me later, again I felt like "what did I do to move this along?" Travis was very apologetic to me as his intentions were not to "leave me behind", I do know for certain his intentions were not malicious, but he wanted to learn through every phase. I get it and am glad he was my partner. Perhaps my own insecurities are making me feel less than equal. I would partner with Travis again anytime as our personalities work well together and I consider him one of my good friends in our cohort.

## D: Professional Skills

 I really enjoyed the professional development lessons given in Mod 1.  I want to continue improving on my communications with future partners using DTRs and would also like to continue developing my social connections in the community using various platforms like Linkedin and Twitter.  The Gear Up sessions were also extremly useful and gave me great insight on how to be a better software developer as well as partner in the greater community.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I've learned that having a growth mindset helps me improve much faster and get through tough obstacles.  Having a fixed mindset can cause one to peak quickly and easily quit when things get too difficult.  By having a growth mindset, I am able to take obstacles as opportunities to learn rather than failures.  I have learned that in order to keep myself from getting stuck in a fixed mindset, I need to break down problems into smaller pieces.  Also, I have found that if I get stuck too long on one problem, I can easily get frustrated.  By moving on to other problems and then later going back to it, I am able to go into obstacles with a clear mind and solve them one at a time, thereby helping me to keep a growth mindset.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I learned that people have a limited amount of cognitive resources, and that the people who are successful in being highly efficient with their time and work, are great about managing their cognitive resources.  By focusing my cognitive resources on the things that are important to me, I am able to achieve much more.  I now am working on conserving my resources for learning and finding better ways of reducing cognitive resource losses by breaking problems into smaller pieces and keeping myself from getting frustrated.

#### Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I believe I am more of an extrovert because I enjoy communicating and working with other people.  However, I have learned that I need to understand how to work with introverts and ambiverts as well in order to avoid problems.  By being open and making sure my partners are comfortable, I can work with people who may be on the opposite end of the spectrum from me.  By working with others who have different personalities, we can achieve great things because we all bring different something different to the table.

#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

I learned from this Gear Up that many people attended Turing for very similar reasons.  By understanding who we are and our motivations for doing things, we are able to create a story that reflects ourselves and helps build our identity.  This is important to me so that in the future, when I am searching for a job, I know who I am, where I fit in the community, and how to share my story.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

The documentary that we watched was quite shocking to me and helped me realize how I can help right now as I dive into this new career by supporting more diversity.  It was also quite suprising to me the consequences of lacking diversity in the tech world.  The example of when airbags first came out, many women and children were killed by them because airbags had been developed mainly by men and had not been tested for women and children was ridiculous to me. In order to develop something for all people, diversity is absolutely necessary. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attempted to help my classmates whenever I could on both individual projects and group projects as well as mythical creatures(unit testing).  I also participated in happy hours with classmates from my cohort as well as other students from other mods.  These were fantastic opportunities to reach out, make friends, and discuss strategies and habits to help improve our lifestyles while at Turing.  I also participated in group retros and spikes every week in order to discuss the wins and losses with my cohort, and learn something new about the tech world outside of the curriculum.  Finally, I attended Demo Night and Code Fair to see other peoples' projects and speak with them about how they developed their software and some of the obstacles they had to overcome during development.
