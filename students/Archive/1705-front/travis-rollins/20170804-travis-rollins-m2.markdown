# Travis Rollins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to get a better grasp of Javascript and work on writing cleaner code.  By the end of the module, I felt like I had a really good understanding of Javascript and knowing how to refactor my code.  I also wanted to get better at Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven-Development.  I feel much more confident in both of these fields after completing the Game Time project using HTML canvas and building the Weatherly project using React. This module was also a great chance to keep building on my skills with teamwork and adapting to different work styles.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed two individual projects this module including:
  * Sorting Suite
  * Complete-Me
  
The Sorting Suite project was a great chance for me to practice my Javascript skills by creating different sorting algorithms.  Complete-Me was another great chance for me to practice Javascript, ES6, and Object-Oriented-Programming by creating a Trie data structure using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary.

# Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The Sorting Suite project includes different sorting algorithms including:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort

## Instructor: Nathaniel
## Optional Notes:

PASS

Student was able to successfuly explain how each of the algorithms worked and what was going behind the scenes when using recursion.

# Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me is a Trie data structure implementation using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary and append them to the DOM.

## Instructor: Limbo
## Optional Notes:

* More testing! Test the simplest things, edge cases, etc.
  * Break out tests into step-by-step assertions
* Be consistent (i.e. for loops and forEach...)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I completed 2 group projects this module including:

  * Game Time
  * Weathrly
	
Our team used Javascript and HTML canvas to re-create the game Tron for Game Time. This was also the first time that we had started implementing tests using mocha and chai to check and make sure the game was working correctly. For Weathrly, our team used React, ES6, and api calls to make a weather application. We spent much more time this project doing Test-Driven-Development using Jest and Enzyme.

# Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Game-Time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This is a re-creation of the game Tron using Javascript and HTML canvas.

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
## Instructor: Meeka
## Optional Notes:

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

Make sure button to reset matches style

Need some stylistic indication of the win and loss to drag the eye to it

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

# Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This is a weather application that displays the current weather and the forecast for the next seven hours and ten days of a city using the Wunderground API and React.

## Instructor: Limbo
## Optional Notes:

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React/JS. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

### HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

### CSS/Sass Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

### Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
I really enjoyed the professional lessons given this module including how to reach out and network with people that are a part of the Turing community as well as how to give better and more constructive feedback when working with a team. I really enjoyed meeting up with my mentor and getting feedback on things to think about as I continue my career as a developer and what I can do to prepare myself better when searching for a job. 

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I really enjoyed the conversations in this GearUp with my fellow classmates and it helped me realize and understand many of the priveleges that I have.  Not everyone is able to enjoy those priveleges or feel safe in their environment.  As a result, I would like to try harder to listen better and try to shift how I work in order to make others around me feel safe.  By doing so and checking in more frequently, I hope I can provide a better work environment for the people around me.

#### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

This was a really interesting GearUp to me in that it made me think differently than I had before on what it means to be an ally.  It was really interesting going through the scenarios and wondering how I could be an ally or if I was the victim, how would I want an ally to respond?  It made me realize how important it is not only to say you're an ally, but really prove it and act upon it.  It's important to keep up with current events and what is going on with the people around you and listen.  I would like to keep working on being a better ally by working with more diverse groups and give equal opportunities to others when possible.

#### Learning a New Language

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/VictoriaVasys/learning-a-new-language/)

I really enjoyed this GearUp and found that it gave me a better understanding of knowing when to start learning a new language and how to go about doing so.  It is important to wait to learn a new language until one feels solid with the language they are already learning.  One they feel ready to start learning a new language, they can use tutorials, documents, and books to research the topic.  Having a structure to learning a new language can also be useful.  This can include meetups, talking to other Turing alumni, doing projects, and teaching it yourself.  One of the best ways of learning something new is relating it so something one already knows.  Another great way of picking up a new language is building something you've already built previously in the new language.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module I spent much more time trying to reach out to my classmates and help them when possible.  I tried to help others when going through the different sorting algorithms as well as make suggestions when working as a class on the complete me project.  For the weathrly project, I also checked in on how others were learning React and help them with Test-Driven-Development. I also participated in meetups with my class as well as check in with Mod 1 students to see if I could help.  I participated in a short class with my module near the end as well to help teach unit testing to Mod 1 students.  Code Fair was another event that occured this module and I enjoyed reaching out to people I don't normally see and check out what projects they were working on.  I am also looking forward to attending Demo Night and seeing some of the amazing projects my fellow classmates have created.
