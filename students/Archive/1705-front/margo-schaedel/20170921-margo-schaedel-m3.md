# Margo Schaedel - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 3 included solidifying my grasp of React and Redux and manipulating large amounts of data using fetch.  I also wanted to improve my skills in testing and develop awareness of other libraries and frameworks relevant to the industry today. In future, I will pivot to strengthen my knowledge in node and express and become more familiar with backend testing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED with flying unicorn sparkles!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For mod 3, we were tasked with an individual personal project, of which I chose to join forces with Christie Lynam to make "do you" an app to assess your personality.

#### do you

* [GitHub URL-Frontend](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you)
* [GitHub URL-Backend](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you-postgres)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The project involved using the traitify api to create and display several different personality and career assessments that a user can then use to assess their personality and possible future careers. There is a backend built in node/express to store user data and results. We are still in process of implementing OAuth.

#### Swapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollyfoz/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was an initial foray into using promises and Promise.all with fetch calls. We used the Star Wars api to pull in data, manipulate it, and display it on different pages.

###### Scores: PASSED
   
#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project delved into tying together react, router, and redux, and manipulating data from the movies database api.

###### Scores: PASSED

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Micro-agressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

In this gear-up session, we all had a chance to reflect on our personal experiences, and examine different ways in which we may commit micro-aggressions without even realizing. We had a chance to share our experiences with members of our groups and also time to reflect individually on how we can continue to make connections and be aware of ourselves if we commit micro-agressions without realizing, even if we have experienced privilege or been marginalized, or been perpetrators of that behaviour to others in the past. I found this session really interesting over all, especially in having the chance to hear so many varied experiences and perspectives, which may have otherwise been overlooked.

### Gear Up
#### Groupthink

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

I found the gear-up session on Groupthink to be quite intriguing, especially with regards to the prevalence and frequency with which it occurs in our society, even at Turing.  There was a particularly important point brought up covering the ambiguity and confusion over the line between a group having an inclusive culture of similar values and traditions/customs, versus a group all professing the same ideas over and over, and failing to bring in differences of opinion (or groupthink). Overall, this was a really interesting gear-up.

### Gear Up
#### The Mod-4 Community Gear Up - Failing Gracefully

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1708-inning/group_three.md)

I missed the opportunity to attend this gear-up, led by a group of mod-4 students, but reviewed the material that was covered on my own time. It is nice to see the concept of failure portrayed in a more positive light, and have that confirmed here at Turing. I definitely now see the benefits in failure, and learning from that failure for the future.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I made a conscientous effort to reach out to people in the greater Turing community, and continued to help out students in mod 2, and at ironFE. Pairing has always been so beneficial for me so I really tried to make myself available for other students to feel comfortable reaching out to any of us in mod 3 for help.
