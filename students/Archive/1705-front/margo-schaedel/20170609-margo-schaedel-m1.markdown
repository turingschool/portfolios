# Margo Schaedel - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

As the first module of my time here at Turing, I was really looking forward to gaining a solid knowledge and grasp on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery, while also establishing a community role for myself within the greater Turing community.  I hoped to get to know my mod-1 classmates as well as people from other mods, establish a clear set of academic, communal, and professional development goals for myself, and generally hit the ground running from day 1.  In terms of accomplishing all these goals, I feel that I have done a pretty solid job of making an effort to establish a solid relationship with each of my classmates, and I think this community aspect of our class has helped to reinforce the various concepts and logic of all that we have learned.  In this sense, I feel that my time here in mod-1 of Turing has been a real success.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed all end-of-module assessments.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following project 'Number Guesser' was our only individual full-scale application project for the module that comprised the coordination of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file.  It was also the first project we worked on in the mod.  In addition to the Number Guesser, I also completed three static comps which are fully responsive websites, but lack javascript interactivity.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project involved building a user-focused number-guessing game, through the application of basic html, css, and javascript principles. Upon initial page load, the site displays several input fields for setting a minimum and maximum number range, a field for inputting the user's guess, and also buttons to assess whether the guess is correct, to clear the field, and to reset the entire game. If the user guesses a number that is too low, the page will display the user's guess, as well as text indicating that the guess is too low. If the number is too high, the page will display its corresponding text to indicate such to the user. If the guess is correct, the user receives the message, "BOOM." The user can reset the game at any time if s/he wishes. If the user changes the minimum or maximum values mid-game, the range will change automatically, thus effecting a reset. In future, the game will be updated to include additional features, such as adding additional levels of difficulty for the user, by increasing the number range with each successful guess.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following comprise the remaining projects for module one, all of which were paired.  They are Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBoxPivot.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project consisted of creating several input fields that would potentially allow a user to build a list of bookmarked links, to be read at a later time. After a user inputs the website title and the web url, the user can click enter, and a bookmark will be generated. Each bookmark also offers the ability to be marked as read, or removed completely from the list. There is also a button to clear all read bookmarks. A counter at the top of the page keeps a tally on total bookmarks, as well as read and unread links.  The site is fully responsive and can be viewed on large or small screens as well as mobile.  It is also fully functional.

##### Feedback from Michael Marlowe:
Appreciation: Kept the project on track / helping to keep me on track. Helping me learn git terminal commands and having the patience for that ( I needed it ). Good energy from the outset and that never changed. Taking some time to get to know me / getting to know you EARLY ON made it more pleasurable to work with you through the week (had we not). Getting out ahead early on different phases made me feel good about the direction and likely success of our project. Willingness to accommodate my needs for my learning/work style. You never made me feel bad for the small mistakes I made during the prjct, like being 30min late, or having to be reminded about creating a merge request, breaking the clear read button, etc. Your attitude kept me from getting hung up on those mistakes and pressing forward felt, and was, easier. Coaching: Try to be more open to listening for openings/cues in your partners answers. Ex: a 'soft yes' can sometimes mean 'No, but I don't wanna get into itâ€¦' Find/take opportunities to change from your most comfortable, or default, role .. esp in driver/navigator scenarios. On driver/navigator: sometimes it felt like you were so energetic you wanted to perform both roles and it made me feel like a backseat passenger. Our time spent working on smaller tasks was good with divide and conquer but I would've appreciated a little more time spent explaining our independent work to each other in more thorough detail.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project we were asked to create an application to keep track of thoughts and ideas. The project involved use of HTML and CSS, jQuery and javascript, along with the integration of JSON and Local Storage. When the page loads, focus is immediately placed on the title input, allowing easier access for the user to begin inputting ideas.

##### Feedback from David Becker:
I had a great time working with you. I feel like our working styles were very similar and it allowed us to mesh right from the get go. Allowing each other's specific skills to flourish, even while working together for the majority of the project, worked very well. For instance, you immediately saw that I was fast typer (...maybe too fast), and because we both are vocal with our thoughts, let me drive a lot of the time. This cut down the time it took us to write what we were talking about or pseudo-coding out-loud much faster, especially because we paired the whole time and became a little pressed for time relative to our confident goals. Being open to finding a method and running with it is something that's a little scary, but works out sometimes. I also appreciate the openness of anything you were thinking, immediately saying something if you felt we needed to rethink it, slow down, or forget about it for a while. In terms of going forward, we both have to be careful about the whole steam-rolling thing. We definitely checked each other every so often, but I'm sure we both felt it at times.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/anajauregui/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project involved a pivot on a previous project (IdeaBox). We were given another team's code base and our goals were to refactor the code base and fix any broken functionality and add any missing functionality from the original specifications. In addition, there were new pieces of functionality to be implemented. This application allowed us to practice using jQuery and javascript for logic and DOM manipulation, and the use of JSON/LocalStorage. We also got to hone our skills in shortening our code, and finding alternative solutions to make our code more concise.

##### Feedback from Ana Jauregui:
Margo, I had a great experience with our paired 2dobox project. I felt that you were very organized and appreciated how you got us started on waffle.io right away to start listing action items we needed to address. I believe that helped us greatly throughout the project to stay on task since we would often discover action items we needed to fix along the way and it was easy to shift focus. I really enjoyed that we were able to talk out our thoughts back and fourth when we were headed in different directions and come up with a solution rather than shutting down or getting frustrated. After our first couple hours when we started to dig into the project I was a little nervous that we were going to struggle to get things accomplished but it seemed like when we put our thoughts together and made it over the first big hurdle we were able to keep rolling right along which was great. Our approaches to look at the problems were sometimes a little different and I would suggest that with your next pairing you do just like you did with me when you allowed me a moment to just stop and take a look and process what you had accomplished. Great work!

## D: Professional Skills

The following comprises a review of the gear-up sessions I attended in module one here at Turing.  In addition, I had the opportunity to take the Strengths-finder assessment in the first week of school, and review my major strengths areas as part of my professional development.  I have also been focusing on improving the way in which I give consistent and specific feedback to my peers, project partners, and instructors.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

In week one at Turing, I was introduced to the 'gear-up' session and participated in learning about the differences between growth and fixed mindset, and strategies to cultivate the first and pull myself away from the last, respectively. It was interesting to hear how many of my classmates' reflections on their fixed mindset-type-upbringing oddly reflected my own childhood.  Something I continue to think about in my time here, is how much our instructors encourage this growth mindset among all of us, especially in regards to engaging in the learning process as an outcome of effort, over results.  In other words, we should focus on the process, not the end result.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I found this particular gear-up session really stimulating, especially in contemplating the effective and efficient use of our cognitive resources, in order to best navigate the academic landscape.  I had a chance to assess the best strategies to harness my own cognitive resources, and gain more awareness of when and where I work best, how many breaks I need while learning new skills, and understanding the importance of categorizing and separating major skills into smaller pieces that can become automatic and easily retained much more quickly.

### Gear Up
#### Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This was a great session that took place at a particularly opportune time, as we had all just completed our first paired project here at Turing.  It was really interesting to see and hear reflections from people who identified with the typical introvert, as it differs very much from my own method of processing (as I identify more with extroverts).  The session was definitely illuminating and helpful in providing further resources and strategies to implement for my later paired projects, especially with regards to being a truly aware and empathetic partner, and making sure I can respect my partner's needs.

### Gear Up
#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

In this gear up session, we all had a chance to reflect on our personal stories, and who and what has made us into the person we are today, and take an introspective look at the path we took to make our way to where we are now, at Turing.  This session was also an introduction to creating our story, which we will have a chance to showcase on the last day of mod 4.  I found this session a little more difficult, because I have not always been able to aptly identify the values and identities that make up who I am as a person.  Pushing myself to search for the words to explain the lense through which I see the world has definitely helped in making me a surer person, and I will continue to write my story as I learn here at Turing.

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This was probably my favourite gear up session so far, and not just because as a woman, this topic resonates particularly with me.  Part of what made this gear up so interesting was my excitement in hearing others' perspectives, and in particular, the surprise that manifested from so many male classmates after we watched the documentary.  I was surprised as well, as I have never felt particularly marginalized as a female, but I do recognize the important role that females can play in the future, by joining this industry.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I definitely tried as much as possible, especially in the beginning weeks of mod one here at Turing, to meet and get to know both my classmates in mod one, and the greater Turing community.  I participated in the Joane Clarke society meetings, related to others in the Impostor lunches, joined the runners group to keep up with exercise, and visited a few of the posses.  I really enjoyed the pairing sessions with the mod two cohort, as well as seeing all the great things created at the Turing code fair, and demo night. In future, I hope to take a more active role in the Turing community in general, not just as a participant.
