# Laura Caroselli - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to sharpen my JavaScript skills by challenging myself with difficult and new JS problems, as well as understand my code from an OOP perspective. I feel like I went into this mod with a good foundation to build on, and the projects during Mod 2 definitely pushed me to think more complexly and have a higher understanding of JS.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the list of individual projects I worked on through Mod 2. Both of these projects really helped me think outside the box and gave me new insight into how I should organize my code. 

#### (Sorting Suite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting Suite is a practice in implementing 4 different sorting algorithms and demonstrating how each works behind the scenes. This project was a worthwhile and interesting challenge and definitely helped me understand the differences and similarities of each algorithm. It also gave me the opportunity to implement more complex code new to me this mod, such as recursion.

* [Evaluation Score] PASS


#### (Complete Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete Me is a project to implement a version of an auto complete system in javascript, as well as a corresponding UI. This project was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about prefix tries and singly-linked lists.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 2 paired projects in Mod 2 - Game Time and Weatherly

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This application is a browser game which mimics the game Frogger. It was a practice in getting familiar with HTML canvas and understanding recursion for our game loop, as well as understanding JS classes, inheritance, and building out our own testing suite.

#### (Weatherly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This application is a Weather app using an API to display the current weather, a 7 hour forecast, and a 10 day forecast. It also implmented our code from the Complete Me project as an autocomplete to search cities and zip codes. It was a good practice in using a web API, asynchronous JS, and an introduction to React, Jest, and Enzyme.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/lcaroselli/13b1866f0edc82020a7f356cca1fb19a)

1. Empathy <br />
This Gear Up helped me to understand more scenarios where I can practice empathy and where my blindspots might be. As an individual, I can work to be more welcoming of those who have experienced life differently. I appreciated being able to think about different scenarios that I may or may not have experienced privilege in and how I can leverage my experiences to be more empathetic to others. It is important to keep in mind that privilege encompasses a wide-range of topics and that everybody experiences privilege in some way; on that same note, this means we can all work together to reduce disparities in society that hold us all back.

2. Allyship <br />
This Gear Up gave me insight into how I can be a better ally. I appreciated this Gear Up mixing different groups across Turing together for discussion; I feel like it really helped give me some perspective into how I can be a better ally and what being an ally really means. I enjoyed the articles that my group discussed, and also appreciated the time to discuss as a larger group our takeaways from the articles. 

3. Learning a Language <br />
This Gear Up was interesting and was a good introduction to how I can go about learning other languages. I appreciated that the student-lead group divided the Gear Up in a logical and efficient way where we went through the process of learning a language and got to sit with individual groups to focus on a new language we were interested in. I was happy to hear that learning through analogy is a good way to learn a language, as this has been my own natural way to learn JS, as well as spoken languages. I enjoyed being able to share my own experiences as my group attempted to learn more about C# in the short time we were given, and I also was interested to understand some of the challenges when picking up a new language and how to overcome them.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
This Mod, I played a part in the community by pairing with people from Mod 1 whenever I had time, as well as participating in a session where our cohort reviewed testing in preparation for Mod 1's pentathalon challenges. I also spent time with my posse to discuss our wins and struggles of the week and offered support as needed.
