# Laura Caroselli - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to gain stronger familiarity with React and also get 
some experience using Redux. I was focused on sharpening my understanding of 
different JS libraries and frameworks. I believe I accomplished my goals for
this mod.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below is the individual project I worked on in mod 3. 

#### (CitySnapshot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/CitySnapshot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

CitySnapshot pulls data from multiple endpoints to generate cost-of-living data 
and create a 'snapshot' of a searched city's quality of life. The user also has
the ability to compare city data and generate a moving checklist which will 
round out their total moving costs.

* [Evaluation Score] PASS

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 3 paired projects in Mod 3.

#### (HeadCount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/HeadCount2.0-1)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This application can be used to search for different school districts, display
their yearly data, and compare averages across districts. There is an auto-fill
search functionality, which will also filter down your search as you type 
matching results, and clicking on two cards will display both district's data
and their averages compared to each other.

* [Evaluation Score] (https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-3/headcount2/laura-jason.md)
PASS

#### (SwapiBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/SwapiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project used the Star Wars API to generate an app that can sort data y category.

* [Evaluation Score] ()
PASS

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lcaroselli/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This application is working off the The Movie DB API 
(https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create 
an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This Mod, I played a part in the community by participating in posse meetings 
and forwarding information about different meetups to members as well as 
classmates. I also actively participated in the Turing community, trying to 
build bridges to other mods by introducing myself, offering help where needed,
and attending a panel at a Try Coding event. I met-up with struggling classmates 
frequently in solidarity to encourage their work and also helped with resume
tips.
