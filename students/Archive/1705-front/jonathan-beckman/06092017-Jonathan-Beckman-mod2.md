# (Jonathan Beckman) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was excited to work more with essential computer science concepts like we did with the Sorting Suit and Prefix Trie projects.  They were difficult but being split between deciding to go with the front or back end program at Turing, I was glad to touch on those concepts in the front end.  I was also very excited to work with React and using an API call for pulling in data to our project.  It makes me feel equiped to actually build an App that people may use.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/Prefix_Tree)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project's goals were to build a functional Auto-Complete when searching for a word in the dictionary.  I built a prefix trie and populated it with a .json file of words in the dictionary.  When searching for a word the application will make suggestions to you as to what word you might be searching for.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

This project's goals were to build different types of sorting methods.  The methods I built were: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

## C: Group Work & Projects

It was nice to have the opportunities to work alone on some of the projects as well as work together with a partner or in a group

### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project's goals were to create an arcade game using HTML canvas and JavaScript that is playable in the browser.  A learning piece for this project was to try and build this game with an object oriented programing approach using classes and inheritance.  One mistake we made in this project was not giving our code a class for the game it-self.  I believe if we had started testing first with the TDD approach we would have realized we needed one sooner than we did.  Each class was seperated into its own file.  To bring the files together we used webpack, which was another learning piece of this project.

## D: Professional Skills

  I appreciate that we have these gear ups to work on and advance our professional skills. In the moment it can be tough to appreciate because there are so many things going on with projects, but I feel like this is one way that Turing shows that they do care for their students success.

### Gear Up
#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I believe the first step in addressing unfair priviledge is to first acknowledge the issues and be sure they are understood and recognized so that they can approached and handled accordingly.  Being aware of these priviledges is the first step.



### Gear Up
#### Ally

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

I think it's important to understand people for who they are and to be accepting of a person no matter their descisions that might be different from what is considered 'normal'.  I don't think it means you have to accept a persons behavior if it goes against beliefs you may have but I don't think it's ok to not be accepting of a person.



### Gear Up
#### Case Study

* [GitHub URL]()

I chose to go to the Case Study on learing a new programming language.  Im interested in learning new languages because I think by expanding your abilities and skill sets, you will be better equiped to take on different jobs in the real world and also have a bigger perspective of how programs and applications work.  During this gear up we learned some good steps to take when approaching a new language.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Ways that I have been a part of the Turing community this mod are by pairing with the mod 1 students.  I realy enjoyed doing this because I enjoy teaching others things as it helps to solidify my own knowledge and I also just enjoy helping others achieve their goals.  Im also up for SAB for mods 3 and 4 so that would be a big way that I would be a part of the community.

## Feedback from mod1 Pairings

#####From Amy Holt

Jonathan! Thank you for all the time you've put in to support us Mod1s! I liked pairing with you and coming to you for help because you make yourself very approachable and are patient and go through things at a pace that I can follow. I'm sure it can be frustrating at times with such beginners but you never had a tone or demeanor that made me feel bad about not knowing something or feeling lost, you were just positive and encouraging.

#####From Luke Finney

As a pairing partner Jonathan was great to work with. I paired with him on two occasions. On both of these occasions I appreciated how he first sought to understand how I was trying to tackle a problem before trying to give feedback. As there are often multiple ways to solve coding problems, this step that Jonathan took ensured that his feedback was consistent with the strategy I was trying to use. One pairing in particular was in regards to a paired project from class. After meeting with my partner and I for the project Jonathan met up with us again later that same day to continue helping, and checked in on us again later in the evening to ensure things were still going well. Both my partner and I greatly appreciated this. I can’t think of anything specific that Jonathan could do to improve, as a feel like his style of pairing matched my style of learning well. With that in mind, I know I tend to be very forthcoming with questions when I have a problem and maybe Jonathan already does what I’m about to recommend, but he could consider  looking into strategies to help ask guiding questions of a pair-ee who doesn’t know what questions they should be asking him in a pairing session.

#####From Francy Lang

Feedback for Jonathan:
-You were very patient and never made us feel incompetent or like we were asking "dumb" questions. 
- You listened really well and used wait time after you asked questions- this was helpful, but it gave us the space to process and respond. You didn't just give us the answers.
- You had us do the "driving" so you helped us navigate and problem solve by using the console and providing guiding questions around the conditional logic. 

#####From Sam Singer

I'd like to start off by saying, I don't understand how previous mods before us got through this process without having an upper mod essentially hold their hand through these later projects. With that being said, Jonathan was an amazing resource! He created time out of his schedule to make sure we were setup for success, whether it was for a scheduled pairing or outside of school hours. We really appreciated when he would randomly check in on us and ask how we were progressing and if we needed any help.

During pairing sessions, I appreciated Jonathan's approach where he would test our ability to think through a problem ourselves while redirecting and providing insights and a different approach when necessary. This was definitely helpful for the learning process going through the material, instead of serving us the answers every time.

Thank you very much for all your help and time! I only hope I'm able to serve future mods below in a constructive manner as well.
