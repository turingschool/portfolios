# (Jonathan Beckman) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I heard Mod 3 was hard tho...wanted to solidify React. I hope to improve on my attention to detail, especially for portfolio defenses.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### HeadCount2.0

(evaluation comments)

#### Scores (out of 4)

  ## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies using a backend with PostgreSQL and using Redux on the frontend.

### Personal Project (DocSwap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project I built a mobile app using react-native that will allow the user to take a picture of a document and be able to translate that document into a different language.

(evaluation comments)

#### Scores (out of 4)

 ## Completion

3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

## Organization

4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

# Technical Quality

## Test-Driven Development

1: Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage). --because testing React-Native with enzyme pretty much can't be done. See the [enzyme github issues](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/928)

## Code Quality

3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

# Product Experience

## User Experience

3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

## Performance

3.5: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills

  I appreciate that we have these gear ups to work on and advance our professional skills. In the moment it can be tough to appreciate because there are so many things going on with projects, but I feel like this is one way that Turing shows that they do care for their students success.

### Gear Up
#### Group Think

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

Group Think is real, even at Turing.  Awarness is key and speaking your mind even if it is against the group is healthy and you should be listening for that voice.


### Gear Up
#### Micro Agressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

Micro Agressions are something that I think that people notice, except for maybe those who are making the micro agression.  I think these things get passed off as jokes more than they should and if someone is affended by it, then there should be someone to stand up for them if they arent willing to do it themsleves.


### Gear Up
#### UI/UX

* [GitHub URL]()

This gear up was good.  If it weren't for the fact that I had pretty much the exact lesson the day before from Louisa then I would have probably gotten more out of it

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Ways that I have been a part of the Turing community this mod are by being a part of SAB.  Listening to the collective feedback from each cohort is a unique window into the community that I get to see and then try to relay to my own cohort.  I have enjoyed being a part of Turing in this way.
