# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

After taking some time off of last mod, my goal this time around was basically to see how well I could do without most of the impediments I had last time. I wanted to know for sure if I could actually do it, because I have <u>NEVER</u> done well in school. While I wasn't the perfect student, just the fact that I did all that I did and (presumably) am going to mod2 shows me that I definitely am capable.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Dog Party)

(I didn't upload to github, will do soon!)
[http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/css-1.html]()

#### (Static Comp 1)

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/staticcompone]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html]()

Our first foray into responsive design. Was a very fun project.


####(Static comp 2)

The second Static Composition

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/staticcomptwo]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html]()

A composition based on a card UI.


####(Static comp 3)

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/staticcompthree]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html]()

A faux-job listing website with plenty of graphs and other CSS complexities.

####(Number Guesser)

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/number-guesser-2]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]()

This was the first page I'd built using Javascript. It generates a random number between 1-100 and gives you hints as you try to guess what it is


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects were lessons in collaboration as much as they were lessons in development

#### (Linked-list)

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/linked-list]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]()

A simple link manager built as an exercise in DOM manipulation. First paired project.

Feedback from partner:
"Hey Tyler, I really had a blast working with you on this last project.  I feel like we nailed this project together and we worked really well together.  Specifically, I liked how you were always open to new ideas with the project, and that we had good communication.  It was really helpful to me when you wrote some code and then explained to me how the logic worked.  Or if you didn't agree with something I had written, you explained why and what you think might work better.  You always stayed focused when we were working together and respected our time.  I really appreciate that man. I also think being laid back and having a super flexible schedule worked really well with me because I work the same way.  I don't have much of a life outside of school at the moment outside of trying to kick some ass while at school! lol. But I would say keep in mind that some of the people you work with in the future may not be as flexible day to day and may prefer to create a schedule in the beginning on when they would like to work together, and when they would like to have things done.  That's definitely something I have remind myself as well because I don't know what else is going on in other people's lives.  But I think with your awesome communication skills and respect for others, I know your other partners will be happy working with you.  Looking forward to working with you again!"


####(IdeaBox)

* [https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/linked-list]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]()

You can input ideas into IdeaBox and it will keep them for you. Employs LocalStorage and more advanced DOM manipulation.

Feedback from partner:
"Tyler, I enjoyed working on this project with you! Although it was sometimes hard to catch each other to pair directly, I appreciated your patience and honesty while we worked out some of the scheduling constraints on our project, and I think we did well in ultimately divvying up the work and pairing when we were both available. I don't think I had the chance to thank you for taking the time to coach me through some of the element attributes I was unaware of (like contenteditable, which made our lives so much easier) and you were a super-quick genius adding responsiveness to our site! I think we're both doing a great job, and I know it can be hard to feel good in your work when so much is coming at you, but I hope this project helped reinforce confidence in your abilities. We're all learning, and if you're ever overwhelmed, I think it might help to slow down and go through your code step-by-step from the top -- I do this all the time, and it really helps me feel more confident in what I'm doing. Thank you again, and I look forward to working with you soon!"


####(2DoBox)

* [https://github.com/hsanchez7934/TG-HS-2DoBox-Pivot]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html]()

Was given another pair's IdeaBox, and refactored it to 2DoBox,

Feedback from partner:
"Tyler, I'd like to start off by saying that it was an absolute pleasure to be able to work with you on this project. I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me over the weekend and after school to work on the project. Upon completing this project I feel stronger with my understanding of javascript and I hope you can say the same as well. I admire the keen ability that you possess of being able to thoroughly examine code and attempt to simplify it so it's easier to understand. This is something I struggle with, I tend to stick with whatever works for me the first time and I forget to come back and question whether I could have written this in a more simplified way, that will make it easier to understand. I was able to realize this after working with you so I'd like to thank you for the insight and the experience that I got from working with you. I'd also like to say that I appreciate you speaking out whenever you didn't understand something and needed clarity. In the end I feel like we accomplished a lot together and feel proud of the project that we created. After working with you I was able to see just how clever and brilliant you truly are. There were a few times that I felt that you were being too hard on yourself whenever you came across something that you didn't fully understand yet and it was hard for me to see this because I recognize that you're truly brilliant and intelligent. So, the advice that I'd like to give you is not be so hard on yourself. You were a great partner and I know you will do great things here at Turing and in your future career as a software developer. I look forward to working with you again in the future! Thanks again!"

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown]()

(Being a repeater of mod1, this gear up session was pretty valuable. I wasn't feeling great about being on the first day all over again, but discussing this mindset really helped shift the way I was looking things. For the remainder of the mod I chose to adopt the growth mindset. It's obvious to me that I have learned a TON over the past couple of months, and if I did it then I can do it now.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

(I wasn't able to attend this session, I had a doctor appt.)

#### (Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts)

(I wasn't able to attend this session, I had a doctor appt.)

#### (Strengths and Storytelling)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown]

(I think the biggest takeaway from this session was actually hearing the stories from other students I was grouped with. Some of them couldn't have been further away from my experiences, and so it was interesting when we discussed the lenses in which we viewed the world. Going forward, it's good to know how varied everyone at Turing is, and will be eager to hear all about them.)

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md]()

This is one that I was particularly interested in. I've heard so many horror stories about the way men treat women online/in the tech world, and it makes me sick. The only thing I can do (for now) going forward is to do my best to support everybody around me, and see later on how I might be able to make an impact. I feel strongly about <i>anyone</i> being mistreated in that way.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I could definitely stand to be more involved in the Turing community as a whole. But in my cohort, I feel as though I'm a part of the group. For the first few weeks I offered help with all that I could, and have made friends that I spend time with.The workload makes things a little intense, but once I'm a little more confident in my skills, I'd be thrilled to host a spike/organize something fun like a movie night. Also, if I move on to the next module, pairing with the new students.
