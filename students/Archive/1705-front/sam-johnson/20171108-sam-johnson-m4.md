## Sam Johnson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My goal for this mode was as follows:
- Get back into the rhythm of coding every day
- Become a better coder - especially w/ regard to React and BE technologies
- Begin to get my momentum back in a job search
- Work on my ability to explain fundamental technical concepts and ideas for the interview process
- Managing my personal responsibilities outside of school

While I still have some work to do around becoming more comfortable talking about the fundamentals, I think I did what I set out to do during this mod.

## Community

##### Summary of how you've contributed to the community
I think I have been a positive and contributing member of the Turing community and plan to continue to be after I finish here.  I have helped a number of students lower mod students on projects - mainly from the Pahlka posse and plan to continue to pair with them after I leave and will be building out the CO education data API for them to use.  I think I have also, at times, been a moderating, reflective voice in the community.

##### A recap of reflections from Gear Up
I really enjoyed organizing and preparing to run a Gear Up session this mod.  While it was difficult at time to get the group to focus on a game plan for the time we had, it was a good opportunity for me to step back, reflect, and figure out the best way to collaborate with a group of people that came to the project from very different places.

I also thought the session ended up going really well and that people enjoyed the time they spent with us.
