-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects



## Personal Project

* [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/personal-project-frontend)
* [Backend Repo](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/personal-project-backend)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

* I built an app that lets a user create an account, search books using the Google Books API, and add their favorites to their library. They
can also click a button to get book recommendations. I used React/Redux with TypeScript for the frontend and Node/Express/Knex/Postgres
for the back end. Learning TypeScript was fun. Building the backend was less fun, but I'm glad I did it.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jackmallahan/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

 * Partner: Jack Mallahan
 * Manipulated and displayed school district data with React. Tried to focus on writing good tests.
 
 * Eval with: Jhun
 
### Scores:

#### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing

- 3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

## SWapibox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Project](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

* Partners: Jason Lucas and Jonathan Beckman (the dream team)
* Used React to build an app that fetched data from the Star Wars API and displayed it in a sick cockpit view. Used a Promise.all to resolve nested API calls. Attempted to test with fetch-mock.

* Eval with: Limbo (legend)

### Scores: 

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

4 - Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Movie Tracker 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Project](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

* Partners: Jack Mallahan and Jonathan Beckman
* Used React and Redux to pull data from the Movie DB API and displayed it using some really sick transitions.

* Eval with: Limbo

### Scores:
#### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


## D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up

### Microaggresions
 * [Session markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

We broke up into small groups for this gear-up and had some good discussions. It really made me think about how I communicate with people, and how things that seem insignificant or harmless to some people can make others feel alienated or discriminated against. 

### Groupthink
 * [Session markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)
 
We talked about the dangers of groupthink and shared our experiences with it. We also talked about instances of groupthink we had encountered here at Turing, and how to avoid it in the future.

### Privacy

We talked about how much of our private information is tracked and sold and came up with our own definitions of what privacy is. We realize that using social media like Facebook and Twitter puts our privacy at risk, but it's hard to completely opt out of that stuff when it's such a prominent part of modern life.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This was a really fun mod. I thought all of our projects were pretty interesting, and it's crazy how much we learned in six weeks. Redux was really intimidating at first, but now I feel pretty comfortable with how it works. I think our cohort did a good job of supporting each other throughout the module. I felt very comfortable asking for help when I was having trouble understanding something.
