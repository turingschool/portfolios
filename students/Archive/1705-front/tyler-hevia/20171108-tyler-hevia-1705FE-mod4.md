# Tyler Hevia - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### Learning a New Language

I enjoyed leading our gear-up session. I wish that we had spent a little more time planning out the structure of our session, but I think we had were able to provide some valuable information to the students who attended, and we got some pretty good discussion going. It was a very positive experience overall, and my group was awesome.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I enjoyed working with the backend students this mod in our job-search groups and gear-up groups. I could have probably done a better job of supporting students in the other mods, and I think the stress of the job search might have prevented me from doing as much of that as I would have liked to. Our mod did a really great job of supporting each other, as we have throughout Turing.
