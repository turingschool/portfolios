# Tyler Hevia - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn how to code with HTML, CSS, and Javascript while also working on my professional development and personal growth. It was very rewarding getting to know my classmates and learning how to work effectively as part of a team. I feel like I have learned something new and useful every day that I've been at Turing.

#### NumberGuesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Created an app that generated a random number, then let the user guess what the number was. It displayed feedback based on whether the user's guess was too low, too high, or correct. It also allowed the user to specify the range within which the correct answer would be randomly generated, and automatically changed the min and max range values by -10 and 10 respectively after each correct guess.

Scores: 

Evaluator: Brenna

##### Optional Notes:

##### Functional Expectations

Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
HTML

##### Accessibility

Advanced Beginner: Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Style

Advanced Beginner: Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
CSS

##### Structure of Code

Advanced Beginner: Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Implementation

Advanced Beginner: Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
JAVASCRIPT

##### Conditional Logic

Advanced Beginner: Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.
Functions & Scope

Advanced Beginner: Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
DOM Manipulation

Advanced Beginner: Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Style

Advanced Beginner: Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient: Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
DESIGN

##### Comp Recreation

Novice: Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
Advanced Beginner: Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

#### Static Comp 1

##### Optional Notes:

into phase 4

split work pretty equally, worked well together. Solid job!

Functional Expectations

Exceptional You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
HTML

Accessibility

|Advanced Beginner | Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags. |

##### Style

|Proficient | Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. |

##### CSS

Structure of Code

|Proficient | Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. |

Implementation

|Proficient | Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. |

##### JAVASCRIPT

Conditional Logic

|Proficient | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

Conditional Logic

|Proficient | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

Functions & Scope

|Proficient | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|

DOM Manipulation

|Proficient | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

Style

|Proficient | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|

##### GIT & GITHUB

Git

|Proficient | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

Github

|Proficient | Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.|

##### DESIGN

Comp Recreation

|Proficient | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|

##### PAIRING

Collaboration

|Proficient | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |

#### Feedback from Molly: 
'I really appreciated how you brought a different perspective to certain parts of the project that we were both working on. For example, when we were both working on the counter function for the project but had two different approaches- I appreciated that you worked it out and showed me how to do it with your method and helped me understand what that problem was a little bit better. I also appreciated how, if you were working on a specific part of the project, you asked me questions about what I thought about it or asked me to help you figure something out. I thought that our collaboration went really well in these aspects. I also really liked your attention to detail with the code base and how you refactored and cleaned things up.  I think that if we were to work together in the future, it would be beneficial if you were a little more assertive about what you wanted or needed to work on and how you wanted to delineate tasks. I felt at times that I was either stepping on your toes or not doing enough because we didn't touch base that often and reevaluate what was working and what wasn't over the course of the project. I am also working on being more assertive with my project partners, so I think that this is something that could have been improved on my end, as well.'

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/TH-HS-Idea-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Created an app that allowed the user to enter a title and a body for an idea, then added the idea to a list. The ideas were stored using JSON, so they remained on the page after a refresh. Each card could have a quality and could also be removed from the page and storage.

#### Feedback from Hector:
'Tyler I'd like to start off by saying that it was an absolute pleasure to have been able to work with you on this project.  I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me everyday after school to work on the project and also for taking the time to meet with me over the weekend.  While working with you I was able to recognize that you have a very brilliant, analytical,  and clever mind.  You absorb knowledge quickly and easily and you're able to apply what you learn to your work immediately.  I admire how you were able to troubleshoot a lot of the issues with the functions that we wrote, I was a little lost at those moments but I was able to learn a lot from watching you work.  There is no doubt in my mind that you have a bright future here at Turing and in your future career as a software developer.  The only piece of advice that comes to my mind that I can give you is to work on making smaller commits on github.  I struggle with this a lot but after evaluating with Louisa, had we made smaller commits for every major advancement in the project, our github workflow would've looked better at evaluation time.  Thank you again Tyler and I look forward to working with you again in the future!'

#### Feedback from Erik:
'Ty Guy! It was great working with you on the 2DoBox. We hit it out of the park for sure. Well except for those damn media queries that tripped me up. Great job figuring out how to get that search bar to do its job. You really are a beast and I think you're gonna be an awesome coder. I feel we made a pretty darn good team even though you had to run me through the JS portion. Our communication was on point, we were diligent and determined, and we were ahead of the game on this one. You taught me a lot about JS and I appreciate you breaking down the way you coded it out. I honestly have only appreciation feedback for you. It was a pleasure! Peace out! - Erik'


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
I think having a growth mindset is especially important at a place like Turing, where you're being introduced to an enormous amount of new information very early on. Things can get overwhelming if you let yourself get intimidated by the workload, so it's important to remember that you'll get more comfortable with the material every day. If you get stuck in a closed mindset, you'll have a harder time accepting new concepts and overcoming difficult challenges.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
This Gear Up really hit home for me. Learning to code is difficult, and struggling with new concepts can be very frustrating and even discouraging. I certainly felt frustrated and discouraged at times during my first few weeks, but looking back now and seeing how far I've come in my understanding of the things I used to  struggle with is extremely rewarding.

#### Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts
I found this Gear Up to be very interesting. I'm pretty introverted, and so talking to people who identified as extroverts gave me some interesting new things to think about. One of my extroverted classmates told me that talking to people drained her energy, which was a surprise to me because it seemed so effortless to her.

#### Strengths and Storytelling
The idea that I should be thinking about what I want my own personal story to look like seemed strange to me, but I think it's definitely an important thing to think about. Shaping my personal story can be a valuable self-reflective exercise, while also letting me frame how I want to be perceived by other people. I will be thinking about how to build my story throughout my time at Turing and beyond.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
This documentary really drove home an unfortunate reality that I had been somewhat aware of but not really thinking about. Seeing the raw statistics surrounding the lack of female representation in programming was shocking, and hearing the stories of people who are fighting to get more women into the industry motivated me to do whatever I can to help solve this problem.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I really enjoy working with other people to solve problems, so I try to help people if they're having trouble with something. I also like to ask people for help if I'm having trouble with something, becuase it gives them a chance to help me out while reinforcing their own knowledge and giving them increased confidence. And I try to say hello to people when I walk by them in the hallway, because I know that I like when people say hi to me. I've also washed like three dishes in the kitchen.
