## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Furever Friends

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollyfoz/FureverFriends)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

#### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**


* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

**2. Organization**

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).


**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

#### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mollyfoz/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

#### Specification Adherence

<!-- - 3 - The application completes 5 iterations. -->
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design

  <!-- - 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. -->
- 2 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

#### Testing

<!-- - 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing -->
- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### Movie Tracker

#### Specification Adherence  

<!-- * 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. -->
* 2: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

Before this gear up I didn't realize that microagressions were a thing, and that I had experienced them in the past. I thought it was good to be made aware that microaggressions exist and that they are way more common than I thought. I am continually keeping them in mind to make sure that I can recognize when its happening, either to me or to someone else.

#### Groupthink

I thought this gear up was really interesting because it brought attention to the idea that individuals are likely to just agree with others and go with group ideas even if they don't agree - that if the majority of people think one way, it has to be correct. I enjoyed considering how this has effected society at large in the past and how it maps on to current events. 

#### UI/UX Design Thinking

I enjoyed this gear up and I think its actually pretty important to be reminded that UX is a thing in the real world, and its something that we need to be considering on our projects, especially now and moving forward. The last mod or so, design thinking seems to have been put on the backburner and I know that I have been more focused on functionality. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was pretty overwhelmed all of this mod and didn't do a lot of community activities.
