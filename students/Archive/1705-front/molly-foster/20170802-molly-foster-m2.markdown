#### Instructor: Nathaniel

#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### Game Time

* [Game Time](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Game-Time)
* [Game Time Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Build a game that is playable in the browser using Canvas.

#### Instructor: Meeka
#### Comments:

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

Make sure button to reset matches style

Need some stylistic indication of the win and loss to drag the eye to it

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

#### Weathrly

* [Weathrly](https://github.com/mollyfoz/weathrly)
* [Weathrly Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Create a functional application to check the weather using React.

#### Instructor: Limbo

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React/JS. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style


3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS/Sass Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Empathy & Privilege

* I thought that this gear up was really interesting because it got me thinking about some privileges that I never considered. For example, one of the items that we talked about was whether or not one would ever second guess calling the police when one/someone is in trouble. I had never reflected on the fact that I have never hesitated to call the police when I felt like I needed to. It really brought into perspective that some people don't feel like they can trust the police, and it leads one to consider how I would feel if I didn't have that constant sense of security. 

#### Being an Ally

* This gear up seemed like an extension of the privilege gear up - now that we recognize our privileges, we are ready to examine how to be supportive to those that might not share those privileges. I felt like it was important because the gear up message seemed to be that one doesn't just declare themself as an ally; it comes with practice of acting when a person or group is being actively marginalized. This concept of being an ally through habituation resonated with me. I feel strongly about the fact that you can call yourself something all you want, but you aren't an artist if you don't practice making art, and you aren't an ally if you aren't actively being one. Additionally, I felt like this gear up was a good exercise in facing those types of situations.

#### Attention Economy Gear Up
 
 * This gear up was super interesting because I had never really considered the small things that websites (i.e. social media) do to keep your attention. I learned that companies actively research people and play off traits of their psyches to trick people into staying on their website longer. I felt this was especially interesting and my group discussed the ethical implications of such practice and whether or not it was the company's responsibility to be ethical or if it was the individual's responsibility to be aware of such practices and limit themselves as necessary. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I helped lead a mythical creatures study session for the Mod 1 students with a couple of other Mod 2 students to help them prepare for the pentathalon. I spent a lot of time at school after hours to help and collaborate with the members of my cohort.
