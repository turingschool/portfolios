# (David Becker) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(At the beginning of the mod, I was definitely focused on passing. As the mod went on, I learned to focus on the here and now and just enjoy what I was learning each. That is not to say, I did not put a lot of focus on getting ahead. I definitely used a lot of energy to stay ahead of the curve. That said, I did work on one thing just as much, maybe with a bit less success (although, I will continue to work on this). That thing was teaching myself to slow down and talk through everything thought process that goes through my head. To do this, I took a lot time to write things down before doing anything on the compupter. During the IdeaBox project, my partner and I spent a good deal of time whiteboarding tasks out and talking to each other about ways to do accomplish them. I think that this method is by far my preffered one, but it also helps me the most. In the future, I will continue to work on slowing down, especially while working with partners/groups on projects, or even just on assignments.)

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Passed, hooray!)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects consisted of:
Number Guesser
Linked List
IdeaBox
2DoBoxPivot
Static Comp #3

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(The task was to complete a game that generated a random number on page load and allowed a user to guess the number. Some additional functionalities included putting in your own range of numbers, the range increasing after a correct guess.)

(The most important feedback from this evaluation was definitely that I had needed to clean-up a lot. I had code that was working, but was very much spaghetti code. )

#### (2DoBoxPivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/2-do-box-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(The task was to refactor a different group's codebase. I actually ended up working alone on this project. The first phase was to refactor, the second phase to change basic functionality to a slightly different version, the third phase to add new features such as importance level and a completed button, and the fourth phase as additional features such as a character counter.)

(The most important feedback from this evaluation was that the CSS needed a bit of clean-up. This came mostly from needing to spend more time on the javascript.)

#### (Static Comp 3)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/DB-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

(Presented with a static comp, we were meant to mimic the layout and general design aspects of the comp. This comp generally was fairly easy for me, just time-consuming. Certain features such as the colored checkboxes, the table, and the shifting of pieces for responsiveness were definitely the most challenging.)

(The big one here was that if someone were to take my codebase it would be difficult to understand quickly. It did the thing very well, but in terms of clarity of code, I was a bit lacking. We talked about different approaches for going about this such as BEM and SMACCS. We agreed that it would be a great benefit for me to work on refactoring with one of these approaches over the break.)

[Evaluation Scores](3-s Across the board. With a 4 in both Comp Receration and Design Concepts)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects included Linked List and IdeaBox. 

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/linked-list)

(This project brought forth some new things for me. One of the major challenges was targeting certain parent containers (or bookmarks) properly. The tasks included beinga able to put a title and URL into two different input fields and then prepending them onto the DOM, as well as being able to mark as read, delete, and keep track of total #, read total, and unread total.)

(Besides receiving quite a stunning evaluation, there was one thing that I was quite proud of: The code was incredibly clean and DRY. Everything worked perfectly and we kept refactoring every step of the way instead of just at the end. Our instructor commented on how well we executed everything with few lines of code.)

[Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-1/linked-list/christie-david.md)

(From Christie - David, I thoroughly enjoyed working with you on Linked List this past week. I felt like we were at similar skill levels, which made for a great learning experience for the both of us. You have a really good understanding of everything we have covered thus far in class, and your enthusiasm and work ethic are 110%. I appreciated that we took the time to work together in learning any new concepts that came up, and didn't move on until we both felt really comfortable. I love that we agreed to both contribute to every part of the project. You did an amazing job at creating and keeping track of GitHub issues for us. This kept us on track and broke large tasks into smaller and more manageable problems. We were super fortunate to have been paired with each other and work at the same pace. However, I think it's important for both of us to be aware in the future that this will not always be the case. We talked about this a good bit during our project.... it's important)

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/idea-box)

(This project was basically the same as linked list, except that we needed to use localStorage so that ideas would persist on page load. We also needed to be able to edit the title and description of an idea. One of the more challenging features was the Search feature in which we had to use a filter array prototype method.)

(The biggest piece of feedback was that we were in a great spot to do a big refactor. All of the functionality was there and worked together, but there were definitely many functions that needed a bit of clean-up. Some of the things could have been done a bit more cleaner (simpler, really), but we had a plan and went with it.)

[Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-1/idexbox/margo-david.md)

(From Margo - I really enjoyed working on this project with you. You work well in a collaborative environment, and are very organized and thorough. Throughout the course of the project, I really appreciated that we were open and direct with each other. I liked that you took the time to explain specific functionality of pieces of the project that you had worked on separately, even after our project had been turned in.  Our white-boarding sessions were phenomenal and definitely helped to clarify the logic for me, which made it much easier to write the code, so that was definitely a great initiative on your part. I thought our driver/navigator style of pairing was pretty effective for the most part, although there were a few moments when I felt as if you were working through a problem in your head, and only after you had solved it, did you then explain it.  Perhaps taking the time to communicate the problem you are processing effectively can allow both of us to work towards a solution together. But honestly, that happened so rarely that it was really not much of an issue. Overall, I thought the project was pretty great, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to work with you.)

## D: Professional Skills
(I found a lot of enjoyment in our professional development sessions. For one, it was a nice chance to step away from coding, and focus on something else. It also provided a great opportunity to converse with and learn about people coming from all sorts of backgrounds and pasts. These sessions helped me start to figure out exactly what I hope to become in the near future. It also forced me to think about things, which I consider sussed out in a lot of ways. These gear up classes provided tools to build a great base for our professional development.)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

1. Growth Mindset
There is one particular takeaway from this session: the idea that I'm an achiever. I have always thought that I fall into this category, but I definitely need work on aspects of it (although I think I have done a good job so far). Carol Dweck talked about finding the little successes in life. And that is exactly what I have tried to do in this mod. Once again, I have always tried to do this, but now it is important as ever to find joy in the smallest of successes. 

2. Getting Better at Difficult Things
The video we watched, Making Badass Developers, talked about 3 different categories of how we group things we are learning or have learned. In group A are things we are trying to learn. In group B are things we have learned, but only so much. And Group C contains things we have mastered. Part of my problem with learning new things is that I have a ton of stuff in Group B and also a ton of stuff in Group A. To fix this, I need to focus on moving more stuff from Group B to C (becoming very proficient in a few things) and not trying to cram so much stuff in Group A. I definitely have tried to focus on that this mod and it will be very very important in the coming mods to find my niche and perfect it. 

3. Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts
This session made me think about my pace a lot. While talking to introverts, I heard the idea that just because an introvert is sitting quietly, that does not mean they are not motivated, do not understand, or don't have an opinion. It simply means that they might be processing a thought. Since I move incredibly fast (too fast) and talk at the speed of light, slowing down is something I continue to work on and will always have to work on. Taking the time to let the other party process and not moving at an extremely fast pace is going to be super important. Basically, I need to focus on not bulldozing. 

4. Strengths and Storytelling 
In this session, we talked about the lenses in which we see other people and situations. In particular, our group agreed that the most important part of empathizing was to try our best to remove the lense or at least be open to adapting your lense so that you might be able to see through another person's eyes. When we go off into the world, being able to do this will play a huge role in connecting with potential employers or just fellow colleagues in the workplace. I will always continue to try my best to rid myself of the lense everytime I talk to someone new. 

5. Debugging the Gender Gap
This was an awesome gear up! One thing that really struck me was the idea that only 10% of high schools in the US offered computer science classes and almost none of them counted towards school credit for a high school diploma. Crazyness! This then, plays a huge role in creating uneveness in genders in the tech fields. I will continue to keep this in mind as I go forward and start trying to help the community with this gender gap. It wil be put on our shoulders to help the next generation of kids learn that anyone can code!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(It was definitely difficult to play a huge role in the community during Mod1. Things were incredibly busy and most of us were focused on just passing Mod1 and keeping ourselves up-to-date. Where I think I played a part in the community was more so in just helping my mod when I could. I also participated in Lunch Roulette and tried to meet as many people as possible from other mods. In the future, I would like to try and collaborate on a small project with someone from another mod during each new mod. I feel like this would be a great way to both get to work with other people and also learn more new things.)
