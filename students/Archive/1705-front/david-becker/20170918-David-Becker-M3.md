# David Becker - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

The biggest thing I wanted accomplish this module was becoming a React/Redux master. I also wanted to work on code quality a lot this module. By this, I mean that I wanted to find cleaner and more efficient ways to accomplish tasks. Another smaller goal of mine was to start the job hunt (that's not going as well as I would have liked).

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I felt like I did pretty well. Code quality was nice and my workflow was decent. The one big comment that Jhun gave me was using the docs a little better. Did the thing!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During this module, we had 4 projects: HeadCount, SWAPI Box, Movie Tracker, and our personal projects. The first two were paired projects, Movie Tracker was a group project (3 person), and the personal project was solo.

#### (HeadCount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/HeadCount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

The project assignment was to work with reusable React components to display Colorado school data.

This project was a great way to revitalize our knowledge of building simple React components and writing in-depth testing for React applications. I felt like I really solidified my knowledge of React and testing with Jest/Enzyme during this project.

[Eval Scores] (N/A) Pass

#### (SWAPI Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/SWAPI-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

The project assignment was to use Promises/Promise.all to make nested API calls to a Star Wars Database and display the data in a UI/UX user-friendly way.

This was by far the hardest project of the module for me. Having very little time to complete this project and wrestle with the various specs was trying and tiring. Testing fetchmock became the biggest crux of the project and never quite figured it out, but succssfully did one fetchmock. Overall, I was happy to have completed this project, but was unhappy with the code quality.

#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mschae16/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

The project assignment was based around a local database and React/Redux. The goal was to pull movie data from MovieDB, display the data in a UI/UX friendly way with our own creative twist, and then to allow users to login/logout and store favorited movies.

The biggest critique on our project was code quality. We had a few places to refactor code to make it cleaner and more readable. Another piece of feedback was on our testing and being more explicit about that.

[Eval Scores] N/A Pass

#### (ConnectMe)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davidbecker6081/ConnectME)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The project that I provided for myself was to create a streamlined application for a few of Facebook's funcionalities. The goal was to connect facebook friends, friend locations, and messaging in order to provide a simpler platform for searching/messaging friends in a particular city.

The two big comments I recieved were refactoring and finishing UI/UX. There were a few places were I could have cleaned up Firebase functionality. In a few cases, there were times were my code could have gone from 8 lines to 1-2 lines by separating out things into other methods or classes. 

[Eval Scores](N/A)Pass

## D: Professional Skills
These Gear Up sessions were very helpful in thinking about both soft skills and how we as students will help change things that we see to be issues when we move into the developer workforce.

### Gear Up - 
Microaggression(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown), 
GroupThink (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md), 
The Robots are Coming(no markdown)

#### (Microaggression)

* [GitHub URL](
 https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Microaggresions are something that, despite thinking they don't exist, occur quite often at Turing, actually. The one in particular that I was most suprised, but very glad to have heard, is using 'hey guys'. Now, when someone says that, they probably don't mean anything except a meaningless hello, but to those who identify with something other than male, saying 'hey guys' can be a bit offensive and exhibiit microagression. So this session was helpful in pointing out the little things that actually matter a lot to people, that we may not notice most of the time, but need to. It will also be helpful going into the workplace (which is always full of microaggresions) in order to mitigate these kinds of things.

#### (GroupThink)

* [GitHub URL](
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

What was most interesting to me in this gear up was trying to decide where and when groupthink was either positive or negative. We were actually able to come up with a few instances where groupthink actually might have been the best course of action. Obviously, in most cases, groupthink was the cause of the demise of such situations. But in things like the military, we couldn't really come up with a better way to go about decision-making. I also brought up an instance of group think that I experienced in Mod 2 when our class was under the spell of groupthink and a few of us felt like our ideas were being shot out the door because of this. 

#### (Mod 4 GearUp- The Robots Are Coming)

* [GitHub URL](
N/A)

I've always been curious about the time when technology starts doing more bad than good. I believe this is pretty far away, but it was interesting to discuss how AI will be affecting the job economy in our near future (and how it already is affecting it). Most people were under the impression (based on statistics) that the job economy would eventually be taken over almost completely by AI. I, on the other hand, am a technological optimist, and believe that technology will solve many of the present issues, including the decreasing job economy. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Albeit not participating very much in the community this module, I did feel like my voice and knowledge was being held in a much higher regard. I also felt like I could help people a lot more efficiently. I think within the community of our class, I felt a lot more connected to my mod and it helped me get through the module. It seems in general that students in Module 3 sort of disappear for 6 weeks and then reappear during module 4 (for good reason), but I do think that this needs to be combatted a bit more.
