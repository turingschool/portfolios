# Ralph Burnette - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My focus this mod was to advance my knowledge in Javascript and all things logic.  I set out to solidify the foundations created in mod 1.

### Projects

#GameTime

#Weathrly

#### Game Time

* [https://github.com/jasonlucas907/game-time]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html]()

Game time was the first project of the mod as well as the first paired project.  The idea of game time was to recreate and build a rendition of a classic arcade game using Javascript and Oop.  This project is to incorporate the use of classes as well as the implementation of HTML Canvas, ES6 is also encouraged.

#### Weathrly

* [https://github.com/mschae16/weathrly]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html]()

Weathrly was the second of the paired projects from this mod.  The concept behind the project was to create a weather forecast app that can be viewed on multiple devices.  The app should display results from various areas using an API call and be completely up to date showing current temp, High, Low, 7 hour and 10 day forecast.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### Being an Ally

* [Ghttps://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown]()

In this gear we read several articles related to how to be an ally to those around you.  The articles I read were good examples of learning to speak up in a supportive fashion for those facing adversity or challenge at the same time not pointing fingers or placing blame.  Best piece of this gear up was the small group breakout.  I was introduced to two students I didn’t know and was very excited to hear their take on several issues.

#### Empathy and Privilege

*[https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown]()

This Gear up session was based on the idea of Privilege and empathy.  after reading and group discussion we broke into small groups to discuss a few matters and how they applied to us in our own personal lives.  I was very interested to hear these results as my group consisted of 3 other students coming from different areas and different upbringing.  It was very interesting to hear how we both had much in common and completely different views on subjects like personal displays of affection and even interaction with police on any level.  I was amazed to hear some opinions and couldn’t believe thatI was unaware that you could feel a certain way.

#### Strengths Finder

* [career-development-curriculum/module_two/teamwork_and_strengths.md]()

I enjoyed this gear up session mainly because o the interaction I had with my newly assigned paired project partner.  After group discussion and reflection we broke out to groups with our partners to discuss what it is that we bring to the table.  I was very interested to hear what margo had to say as I had not yet worked with her on a project.  We had some things in common which I feel helped send us in a good direction.  We also discovered that some strengths we had complimented each other and we were able to build off that.  Moving forward, I would discuss strengths with future partners as part of the DTR i feel that this will be very efficient in jumpstarting a working partnership.

#### Community Gear up

This gear up session to me was by far the most valuable.  After a few challenging weeks of lessons I was left exhausted.  This session covered the concept of resilience and Turing, a very valuable lesson for all in the program.  It was interesting to hear various methods of resilience and how people can handle different stressful situations and environments.  I especially enjoyed the break out group with who I paired with one of my previous cohort members who was repeating mod1 (like myself) and being able to discuss various approaches to handling the challenges that come our way.  


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I paired with several students from 1706 this past mod.  The feed back is below.

# Amy Holt 
Thanks for taking the time to pair with so many of us, Ralph! What I liked about pairing with you is you acknowledge that we are struggling and go at our pace, rather than going at your pace which is probably a lot faster. You helped me get through a huge piece of functionality on my project!

# Erik Ingvalson  
Hey, Ralph! Thanks for all of your help with 2DoBox. That was some pretty rough logic, but you're examples really helped me and my partners wrap our head around what was happening, especially with trying to attack those different "importance" filters. You the man!

# Matthew Arvidson 
"I have had several pairings with Ralph and he helped me tremendously each time. He has a very down-to-earth style of teaching that matches my learning style very well. He was able to deconstruct complex concepts and then explain them clearly to me as we built them back up to functionality. Ralph even manages to pepper in much needed humor during times of difficult struggle! I look forward to having Ralph as a resource moving forward in Turing."
 
Thank you for all of your help!
