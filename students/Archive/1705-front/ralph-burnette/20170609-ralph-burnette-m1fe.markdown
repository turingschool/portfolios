# Ralph Burnette - M1 Front End Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

As a student repeating Mod1, the goal I set forth this time was slightly different than the last attempt.  This time I was determined to develop a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and especially this time JavaScript.  I was not pleased with my performance last time and made sure that I did all I could to ensure I would exceed my goals.

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 1
## Evaluator: Brenna
## Optional Notes:

PASS

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

* __Proficient:__ Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic

* __Proficient:__ Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Objects & Prototypes

* __Proficient:__ Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

# Pentathlon: Code Challenge 2
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Optional Notes:

- seemed real nervous, was a little all over the place
- i asked him questions and stressed him out
- GOOD JOB! seemed a liiiiittle reversed, but understood what was happening and how to solve the problems being presented

#### Arrays

* __Proficient:__ Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes

------------------------------------------------------------------

## TESTING

#### Test Comprehension

* __Proficient__: Can read through each line of a test and understand how to drive the development to make the test pass. If stuck on making a test pass, they know how to investigate where and how the test is failing using the error messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEBUGGING

#### Dev Tools/Debug Process

* __Proficient__: Uses the dev tools as their first line of defense when encountering something unexpected. Demonstrates comfort and skill using dev tools to investigate, check layout issues, console log results, and experiment solving problems before writing abundant amounts of code. Will experiment with javascript in the console to test unfamiliar concepts.

# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge
## Evaluator: Brenna
## Optional Notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Exceptional__ Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


#### Design Concepts

* __Exceptional__: Typography, color choices, and layout decisions are thoughtful and appropriate, and strongly enhance the layout and legibility of the design.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

There were four individual projects in Mod1.  Three were Static comp challenges and one the application for Number Guesser.

#### (Static Comp 1)

The first of the static comp challenges, this project employed the use of flexbox as it had been recently introduced with responsive design.  The concept of the layout should be able to translate from desktop to mobile devices.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/RB-1705-static-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)


#### (Static Comp 2)

The second of the static comp challenges, this was a re-creation of a site that incorporated a "card" style layout.  The site was re-created to be responsive on desktop and mobile devices.

* [GitHub URL](https://rburnette3.github.io/RB-1705-static-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)


#### (Static Comp 3)

The third and final static comp challenge.  This was a recreation of a very complex layout that needed to be responsive on desktop and mobile devices.  This layout employed almost every aspect of CSS and HTML covered over the mod.

* [GitHub URL](https://rburnette3.github.io/RB-static-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)


#### (Number Guesser)

This was the first project using JavaScript.  The concept was to create a number guesser game that supported various user interaction.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was the first of the paired projects.  The concept of this application was to be able to create and store various links to websites.  It incorporated DOM Manipulation and also was the first pass at collaborative working through github

##### Feedback to me

Ralph, I really enjoyed working on this project as your parter. You really made me feel more comfortable throughout the project with skills that I was feeling shaky on. Specifically, it was  helpful  that you were agreeable to work together to solve some of the Javascript logic behind disabling/enabling buttons and figuring out how to avoid deleting our whole card stack from saved bookmarks when we only wanted it to be one at a time! When we first began the project I think that we could have done a better job at being more clear with our communication on which parts of the project we would take on individually and which files we would be working on to avoid having merge conflicts when we came together. However, looking back at the work-flow of our project from beginning to end, I think we did a great job progressing on our communication of what pieces we would divide up and work on like when you went home and worked on the responsiveness, which was tremendously helpful and I worked on some of our button functionality glitches. I would say that for future pair ups you keep it up with being upfront about what you feel comfortable with  and where you want more practice like you did with me because that allowed us to break apart when we needed to and bring our heads together to solve what we both felt we struggled with.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was the second of the paired projects.  The concept of this application is to be able to make personal notes to the user which are presented on the DOM ad prepended, dynamic items.  This project also incorporated the use of local storage.

##### Evaluation Results:

##### Feedback to me

Hey Ralph, I really enjoyed working with you on this project! I appreciate how you wanted to write the HTML & CSS together- it definitely helped to avoid naming conflicts later down the road. I also really liked how you were totally comfortable with asking others for help when we got stuck on a problem, which helped us together but also helped me to not spend too much time spinning my wheels. I think that if we were to work together in the future that it would benefit us if we stayed on task a bit more. Also, I think that we could benefit from doing more pseudo coding and talking things out- in the later stages of the project, we were a little too quick to jump to others for help and I just think that might hinder our learning experience if we aren't exhausting our own resources. I hope that we get to work together again!

#### (2DoBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rburnette3/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was the 3rd and final paired project.  This project was a pivot of ideabox, the assignment was to implement small changes as well as refactor.

##### Evaluation Results:
* https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-1/2DoBox/david-ralph.md

##### Feedback to me

I enjoyed working with Ralph on this project. He made himself available to work around my schedule the best he could and was dedicated to getting me any help I needed with my portion of the project. I feel we did a good job with our DTR and establishing expectations.  He put in every effort to make himself available to me, but ultimately the division of labor sort of silo'd us as I wanted to prove myself.  Also, when working through the refactor I took on the harder problems and bringing him in to help after hours of digesting the code and the problem just did more to stall the process. He was working on repurposing a switch statement and I had to digest and regurgitate some of the more verbose and complicated code.  Maybe if I had grabbed him when I spoke to the original writer of the code seeking clarification that would have put him in a better position but again, when you divide work I feel a certain obligation to get my portion done on my own and honor the original DTR.  These things are good for me to think about further to try and shore up the shortcomings of a particular process, but overall our partnership went really well.


## D: Professional Skills
I greatly enjoyed and found much value from the various personal development sessions throughout.  I believe this combined with the technical applications will better prepare all Turing students to transition into the workplace.

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset:

As a repeating student of Mod1 I found this session incredibly helpful.  My personal performance last mod was disapointing and disheartening.  This session was a wonderful reminder that I am capable of changing, learning and achieving the goals that I have set forth.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

#### Getting Better at Dificult things:

Reflecting back at last mod, this session stood as another reminder that we as humans are capable of greatness, personal growth and our own achievements.  Turing is hard, this helped be look back at how far I have come.  

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

#### Working with Extro/Intro/Ambiverts:

I was absent this day.

#### Personal Story:

My main takeaway from this session was that of personal branding and learning to standout with your successes.  I think this is valuable because we are each different people with different goals in life.  It reminds us that we are individuals.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

#### CODE Debugging the Gender Gap:

This was a very valuable session as it exposed very real and prevalent issues of discrimination alive in the tech industry today.  It also helps us understand our role as to helping to put an end to it all.  This awareness will lead to a better workplace and also a better way of life.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Having gone through mod1 twice now I was able to lend a hand to others in my cohort with both technical and personal development.  Whether it be a CSS question for a static comp or just to say "yes it is" when someone else says "JavaScript is hard!"
