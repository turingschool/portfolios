### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

Prior to this session I had never put much thout to or understood microagresssions.  To be honest, I dod not know that they were even real.  Walking away from this session I felt better equipped to both acknowledge and avoid this behavior as well as identify it with others and help to diffuse a situation before it becomes blow out of proportion



#### Groupthink

I was under a very different impression of what the definition of what groupthink was.  Walking into it I thought it was a practice or a way to team with others for a greater good.  I cam e to realize it was more about harmful effects that one perspective could have on a group.  It encourage me and others inside my small group to act more independently and express our own opinions.
