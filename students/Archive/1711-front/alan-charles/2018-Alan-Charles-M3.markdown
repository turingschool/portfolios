## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I set out to really understand how React works. I thought I had a handle on it last time but the improvements I feel I made has shown me how wrong I was. I finally feel ready to consider myself a programmer.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(This mod’s individual projects included SWAPI Box and my personal project, League Leader. I became more comfortable with React and Redux in the process. These projects helped me nail down testing in React and Redux as well as ganging a better understanding of the React landscape in general.  )

#### SWAPI BOX

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/swapi-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](1.Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router (if you want to).
1. Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
2. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
3. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
4. Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
5. Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
6. Use propTypes for every component receiving props)

(SWAPI-box is a react app that allows users to view Star Wars data from the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/documentation. There are four buttons that allow the user to browse through people, planets, vehicles and favorites. Users can add cards to favorites by clicking on the favorite button.)

Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 4 iterations.
Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
SASS/SCSS
Pass - Styles are written using either SASS or SCSS
Fail - Styles are written using vanilla CSS
Testing
1 - There was little to no attempt to test this application.
PropType Implementation
Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.
README Updates
Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place
Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints
1 - More than ten complaints
Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### League Leader

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/league-leader)
* [Original Assignment]
The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.

League-Leader is an app designed to make betting with friends much easier to do. Users have the ability to log in, pick a sport and draft teams. Users will soon have the ability to invite other users and hold multi-person live drafts. The App is built with React, Redux, and Router on the frontend and node, express, and knex on the backend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects for this mod included HeadCount 2.0 and MovieTracker. I feel that this time around I really focused on teaching the processes of React and Redux to confirm my own understanding. I feel as if I gained a much better understanding of both and got a lot of joy out of helping others understand it. 

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/quinhill/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment]

•	Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.


(Head-count is an app designed to display kindergarten data from the Colorado public education system. Functionality includes the ability to search for a school's data, and the ability to compare a school against another school. The main goal of this project was to become more comfortable with React components, passing props, and TDD.


Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.
Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
README Updates
Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints
Workflow

4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/movieTracker)
* [Original Assignment]
The goal of this project was to use and understand redux in conjunction with React. We learned to pass props, connect the redux store to the visual layer, and most importantly, how to test redux.

Movie-Tracker is an app designed to display data using the moviedb API. It has functionality allowing users to view upcoming movies, their description and their overall rating. Users are also able to select favorites from from the list of movies and view them later under the favorites button. The main goal of this project was to learn about how to use redux, router, TDD as well as gain a better understanding of react.


Rubric
Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.
Code Quality
4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
CSS/Design
4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

5. Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Redux Architecture
3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did my best to be  helpful to students going through lower mods and to my classmates going through mod3 for the first time. I feel as if I became a better teacher in the process. It was fun and something I enjoyed more than I thought I would.
