## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_
I wanted to grow as a developer. Before this mod, JavaScript made me nervous. I have learned to love ES6 and array/object manipulation, because I finally feel comfortable enough with it to see how useful it is. I also feel as if I can better articulate my process while using proper vernacular, which I have previously never felt comfortable doing.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I think my individual work definitely helped. I used to immediately go find help when something wasn't working. Continually working on array prototypes on my own really helped to cement my process. The most challenging part was getting over the self-doubt when something wasn't working. I learned to figure out what was happening (usually), and from there began to notice patterns. I plan to continue trying to work through issues on my own. I felt less stressed this mod than ever, but still sometimes had trouble dealing with it. I would like to continue to change that in the next mod, because I'm really beginning to see how stress makes it harder to focus on the process. 

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_
I sort of mentioned this above, but I think my study habits were the biggest change for me this mod. I have learned to take studying more seriously, especially when it comes to finding time to do it on my own, even if it's just for an hour at a time. I read just as much as I did in mod one, but now don't just read. I try to do every example I can get my hands on. I think my study habits are getting better and are starting to serve me well. 


### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_Pass

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I honestly did not enjoy Sorting Suite, at the time. I struggled to see the value, but in retrospect it was a great exercise in JavaScript. I would have to say it was probably the the project that honed my JavaScript skills the most. Working together was different than paired projects because I was able to work on different problems with different groups of people. Hearing people's ideas, talking through them, and figuring out a strategy was a great way to understand JavaScript because you could see how others were using it and comparing it your own methods. I think it serves my overall goals in two ways. First, I can now articulate sorting algorithims if they were to come up on a technical interview, and it gave me a great foundation in ES6, which just made me a better overall developer. 

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _0 - 4_n/a
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_n/a
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _0 - 4_n.a
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_n/a
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_n/a

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

My feelings about Complete Me were quite similar to my feelings about Sorting Suite. I wanted to practive array prototypes and sort of felt distracted with this project, at first. I think this was because I didn't understand how much more comfortable I would be with JavaScript by the time the project was over. I worked really hard on the Select method with my mentor, and it was one of the first times we got to really dig in and work together. He taught me a lot during the pairing and I came out of it really comfortable with ES6 syntax. I also immediately saw its value when we implemented it in our Weatherly project. IT WAS SO COOL TO SEE AUTOCOMPLETE WORK. I was honestly skeptical that it actually worked after we were done, but seeing it implemented was an incredibly cool feeling. I think it serves my overal goal to become a better developer. I am now more comfortable with ES6 and I can speak to prefix and binary tries. 

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_Quin Hil
* **Game:** _Name of game you built_Breakout
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_3
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_3
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_2/3
* **JS Style:** _0 - 4_3
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_3

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
It was the first project I was proud of enough to show my friends and family. I really enjoyed working with Quin. As far as the code goes, I feel like the coolest part was coding with the intent of making a level up feature dynamic. Last time I did gametime we didn't think about that until the end and it was a nightmare to fix. I got very comfortable with class inheritance and ES6 with this project. It was my first time back and really helped get me back in thr grove. It was an introduction to ES6 and class inheritence which are becoming incredibly important when writing production code. So this project served my end goal because it was a great introduction and got the mod off to a great start. 


### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_Krista Handel
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_3
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_3
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_3
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_3
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_3
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_3
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_3
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_3

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I loved react. It was great to work with a frontend again. The project itself was very challenging, but that was mainly because everything was new and we we're battling the stress of eval week. Krista was great to work with. Testing was really hard for me to get my head around, and I really look forward to learning more about testing in mod 3 because usually when I understand testing I have a relatively solid understanding of the language, or framework in this case. It serves my overall goal of becoming a competent developer by introducing me to react, which is an incredibly popular framework right now, and a sought after professional skill. 

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _List here_
  Agile Practices
  Feedback 2
  Feedback 3
  Storytelling 2
  Networking


_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

I wouldn't say I found anything particularly surprising, but I did find a lot of the sessions more useful than I thought I would, especially the Storytelling 2 and Networking sessions. I learned that I really need to hone my storytelling skills, but the lesson definitely prepared me to take the right steps. The netoworking session actually landed me an interview! So I definitely think that prepared me for my future life as a developr. 


* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _List here_
  Empathy & Privilege
  Group Think/Attention Economy/Tragedy of Commons
  Choice Session

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I am continually surprised by the lack of diversity in an industry that seems to preach inclusiveness. I think those conversations are increidbly important because problems cannot be fixed until they are addressed. I found some of those conversations to be some of the most constructive I've had in my time at Turing, especially in terms of the tech industry as a whole. I definitely feel like I can continue to talk about this with teams I'm on in the future. I desperately don't want to work with a team of other white males, and don't want to work for a company that doesn't make a concerted effort to create a diverse workplace. 

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I was feeling a little down when I started the mod, so I was hesitant when it came to interacting in the community. However, everyone is so friendly that I ended up becoming relatively close to my new cohort and learned a lot from them. I also paired with students in other mods, both below and above. I really learned just as much from both. When pairing with students in mod 1 I cemented my html css and javascript skills. When pairing with students from higher mods I really began to graps concepts that were otherwise impossibly elusive. The overall experience was incredibly enjoyable, and I'm thankful for it because the community really pulled me out of my self-induced slump. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

Leta grave some great feedback after the assessment. She said that it was clear that I knew what I was talking about, but could use some practice when it comes to making my code more efficient. For instance, chaining array prototype methods or at least doing multiple in one function. I agreed wholeheartedly and feel that now since I understand how everything works, I would really like to practice making my code as clean and efficent as possible. I am going to take some time to myself so I can recharge my batteries. That for me probably means closing my computer for a day or two and enjoying nature. Toward the end of the week I plan to start reaching out to the developer community in Denver so I can slowly start begininng the job search. 

# Outcome:
Promote to Mod 3
