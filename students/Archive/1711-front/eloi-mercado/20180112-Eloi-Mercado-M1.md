## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects consisted of Number Guesser and the 3 Static Comps.

#### (Static-Comp-1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eloimercado/EM-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

#### (Static-Comp-2)

#### (Number-Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eloimercado/em-number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

## Student: Eloi Mercado
## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### html
* Love the kabob case and indentation
* Inputs should always have a label

### css
* Dry it up
* Add comments for better organization
* Pick convention for organizing inside blocks

### js
* Dry it up by breaking similar blocks of code into functions
* Remove lines in between variable declarations
* Try using more action like words for functions ie. generateNewNumber instead of newRandom number, setRange and winGame are good names
* Try using more local vars and pass them around functions as arguments

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

(Intro)

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eloimercado/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark

## Student: Austin and Eloi
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- did work past the 9:00am deadline
- not responsive
- need help with git/github comfort -- did 100% of the work on Austin's machine
- code needs refactor and cleanup

## Functional Expectations

We did a great job of getting things done under the pressure of the  time constraints we experienced.  Obviously it was hard with the illness and being out, but I really appreciated how hard you worked to understand JQuery and how much you contributed to the JS portion of the project. You did a great job of bouncing back after being out and missing class, I can only imagine how hard that was.  We are both good at communication, but at times it was hard for us to get in a work flow that used our strengths to their full potential.  We can both work on being more transparent up front and setting more clear expectations, and a plan of action during the beginning of the process so the details can all fall in to place more naturally without us having to decide what to do next.  I really enjoyed working with you and it was great to get to know you better

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eloimercado/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## Student: Patrick and Eloi
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:
- would like to see a ton more commits! 13 is not enough

### comp
- Use fixed widths for vertical(top and bottom) box model things - should not be resonsive from top to bottom, only left to right

### html
- Use labels!! Either aria-label or label element

### css
- consider organizational comments and using bem

### js
- pull duplicate blocks into functions and pass whatever is dynamic as an argument
- love that you used a constructor function and especially a method on the prototype!!!
- use more abstractional naming, ie. Idea instead of IdeaCardObject
- as you prepend to the page use your object to your advantage, ie. newIdea.title instead of $inputTitle.val()
- be verbose when naming variables, wtf are x and y???!?!

### git/github
- Many more commits!!!
- get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!

## Functional Expectations

* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing 

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

IdeaBox went very well for us. We had success early on in the project in researching the new topics and implementing them into our codebase. We also did a great job of sticking to our DTR outline. We met at our agreed times, and were very consistent with using Git. Additionally, you did a great job of reeling me in every time I tried to write a function that was way more complicated than what we needed for our project to work. That helped us keep our code trim and sleek. One thing we were challenged with was the the final stages of the project. Once we achieved full functionality of our website, we took our foot off the gas and diverted our attention to other projects and work we had going on. We missed a few opportunities for refactoring, and our site did not quite have the responsiveness that it should have had. My suggestion for both of us going forward would be to maintain the level of diligence we had at the beginning of the project throughout the entire duration of the project.Doing so would produce a highly polished site that has both functionality and responsiveness, with a code base that would be easily maintained by other developers. Overall, I believe we made for a great team and hopefully we will be able to work together again in the future.

#### (To-Do-Box)

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

## Students: Eloi & Alan
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN/COMP
- Completed through Phase 3. Very little refactoring of CSS - mostly JS.
- Code that was added to the project is not responsive. Weird things happening at different break points
- Partial filtering - must refresh screen to work properly
- Only need filtering for importance. For the future, be sure to clarify specs with instructors when unsure
- No visual indication of when the submit button is disabled/enabled

### HTML

- Nice job with labels and other ARIA attributes
- Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - main form does pretty well, but the dynamically generated cards are not fully accessible.

### CSS
- Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organizing declarations

### JS
- Naming pretty easy to follow
- Be mindful of syntax. Follow [style guides for JS](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- Be ready to speak to all of your code - not just what you write, but also what you inherit
- Opportunities for refactoring for event handlers on filtering buttons by using delegation
- Unclear why you are pulling from local storage a second time in 50 - just append cards with `complete-task` as value to the page
- Remove leftover functionality in line 69
- Only pass in dynamic arguments in line 73 for constructor - `title`, `content`, `id`. `this.complete` property could be set up as boolean of true/false
- Pass entire object as argument to `createCard` in line 108 
- `downvote`/`upvote` quality could be refactored into one single function. Same with `editTitle`/`editContent`

### GIT/GITHUB
- Having one final push to master from one single commit is unnacceptable - be sure to make atomic commits, work on branches, etc

I enjoyed working with you. We ran into some serious time constraints around the holiday, but still managed to get most of  the functionality working in time. You were great at helping me work through each function in the js. In the future, I would recommend maintaining a more open line of communication with your partner. It would help in terms of planning actual project time and working through the project together. There were multiple times where you knew the answer, which is great! Don't be afraid to say something, even if you aren't sure it's exactly right, because from there you and your partner can talk it out. All in all, I enjoyed working with you and hope to do so again.

## D: Professional Skills

Turing helps with developing professional skills. 

### Gear Up
#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

The growth mindset gear up was an interesting topic because it made me look back at my entire schooling career. I have learned that you must understand the full topic and not just get the answers right . This has helped me at Turing because its not just about getting the code right, it is about understanding the code you write and making it easier for other people to read. 

#### (Stress Management)

The stress management gear up was really helpful because it gave me good strategies to put into practice when I get really stressed out. Some of the strategies that a learned were to take short brakes and breath just to center yourself. I will continue to practice these strategies thought Turing and life.

#### (Mod 4 Lead)

I really liked this gear up because it was lead by students. The one that I attended was about the “struggle”. It was really helpful because I learned that failures are just stepping stools to success. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was able to be a part of posses and attend some after school activities such as going to Brother's and getting the $2 burger. Our posse was able to bring mentors to talk about life after Turing. I was also able to pair with Mod 2 students and they were very helpful.
