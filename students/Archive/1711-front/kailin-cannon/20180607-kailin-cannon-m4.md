## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Developing professionally. I'd done the bare minimum for PD's for the past mods, but with staff support I realized how important it was to finally kick things into gear and get stuff done. I had 6 weeks to really get help with things I needed to learn and work on, and coming out of Mod3 I had zero confidence in job-related stuff. I've never had a career before. I've never even had an interview besides the one to get into Turing. I'd never made a real, viable resume or written a cover letter, and I had no idea what industry I wanted to work in or what type of company or anything. My biggest success in mod4 is solidfying all of these skills and concepts. I've learned that I'm pretty much technically agonistic, I don't care what language I work in, as long as I'm working for a company whose culture I enjoy, and at the top of my wishlist is a 'brand' company, like Discord, who make their own product and maintain it. I know how to write cover letters, and my resume doesn't look like a vague attempt at professionalism. Most importantly I don't experience a minor panic at upon hearing the words 'job hunt'. 


## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest achievement was my biggest struggle, so it's sort of the same answer. My biggest struggle is just personal stuff. I'm young with no experience, and I'm a terrible adult. I haven't yet got the work-life balance down. I (still) haven't done laundry in six weeks, and I ordered groceries maybe three times throughout mod 4. During week 3, I almost cried when I opened my dishwasher and saw all of my dishes, clean for once. 

I think I was also struggling with the pace of Turing. In week 2 of Mod 3, my mom called me and I ended up telling her I thought I was going to have to repeat again. I felt like I was learning at the same pace as I had been the first time in mod 2, which I had to repeat. I didn't think I was going to pick everything up quickly enough. In the end, I passed, and I think for the first 2 weeks of Mod4 I was just kind've shellshocked I'd even made it. I didn't feel like I'd made some magical caterpillar-to-butterfly transition into a developer. Regardless, I just ignored it and kept on going. 

In week 3 of Mod4, I sort've crashed and burned. Mod 3 was busy, but at least it was mostly big projects. The same sort of schedule each week. Mod 4 was a slight pull back on big projects and coding till midnight, because we suddenly had job stuff piled on top. It really did me in, on week 3. I just kind've existed that week, like an amoeba. 

Week 4 I recovered, and got back on track. The external-reviewer PD session really helped me, I think. I was forced to tell my personal story, which I thought was going to be a terrible experience, but actually ended up getting extremely valuable feedback. Not only did it help me shape up my story, but it energized me again. I decided that I wasn't going to be writing cover letters and applying to jobs for the rest of the mod, but at least I was still looking at companies. 

Through feedback with instructors, on projects, I've been told that I should organize and schedule better. What I learned from this struggle is that I really need to apply some of this organization to everything. I need to file github issues for my life. Really, though, even though I've been a student my whole life, with different things due at different times, Mod4's mix of school-and-job work felt so different to me that it kind of just fell apart in my hands. I think I'd benefit from taking baby steps to set a firm balance. Maybe order groceries every week on the same day, and do the same with laundry. Aggressively use my google calendar for meeting with anyone, because I forgot I had meetings several times throughout mod4. Basically just set tasks to a steady, set schedule and automate reminders so that I'm not relying on myself to remember things. 


## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I was an SAB rep this inning, and hopefully soon I'll have a blog post written, though it won't be quite on time to be called 'this' inning. 


## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I loved learning about how to build out my own API. It was something that had been on my mind in Mod3. It feels so powerful to go from having to lookup third-party APIs and being disappointed if the one you're dreaming of doesn't exist, to simply saying 'oh this doesn't exist yet? I can build one myself'. I also like how straight-forward server-side is. Even though we were still working in Javascript, it didn't feel so much like the Wild West. Testing was especially much easier.

Job-wise, I think my biggest worry is a non-issue. The only thing I wouldn't want to do in a job is be the one responsible for deciding what the initial back-end structure of an app looks like. The hardest part of all of the mod4 projects was deciding what tables to have, and how they were going to relate. I like building from one detail on up, and it's hard for me to see 'big picture' from the onset. I have trouble wireframing for the same reason. But as I said, I think it's unlikely that I'd run into this situation in a job, especially if I end up with a branded company. 

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Like I said, I think the most important skill I'll take with me is just learning how to organize, both my code and my life. I've started filing github issues like a madwoman for all of my projects. Any little tidbit that I need to work on, or remember, goes into an issue. It's support for the 'one tank' brain theory. I don't have to hold all these little reminders for myself in my brain anymore, and it relieves fatigue and stress. It helps my struggle with 'big picture', because once I have a physical list of to-dos I can split them up and organize each day into doing a set. Also it's super satisfying to close issues.
