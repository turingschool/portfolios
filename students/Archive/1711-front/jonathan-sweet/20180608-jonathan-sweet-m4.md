## Mod 4 Portfolio - 1711-FE

It is hard to believe the last seven months have already come and gone. It seems like only yesterday that I was first learning the fundamentals of web technologies and building my first IdeaBox. So many mythical creatures ago, what seemed challenging then, feels second nature now. Not sure how I would feel as the program comes to an end, I take comfort in the skills that I have acquired and the preparation I have for my career as a software developer.

Entering Mod 4, I was fortunate to have some experience with Express and server side work. That experience led to quick comfort with the task of setting up a server and database which allowed me to better absorb the rest of the material and experiment with new technologies. My biggest achievement in Mod 4 was understanding and debugging the Node event driven architecture and bring Nightmare, a traditionally server side process/library, to the client side to automate the browser in a non-traditional way. My captstone project partner and I took a risk by using a technology in an unconventional way. With little direction except for technical documentation, I feel confident that my process has evolved to the point where I could pick up any new technology in a short amount of time. 

The struggle, as it has been throughout my Turing career, has been with UI/UX Design. I've recognized that my intuition for good design is not great, by any means, but the continual exposure I've had to good UI/UX has inspired me and provided a better perspective when considering the needs of my user. Further exploration of design websites and bootstrap libraries to shape my eye for design will be a part of my growth plan as I venture out in to the wild. 

Leaving Turing, the biggest takeaways I will carry forward are the ability to understand technical documentation, an established, refineable process for problem solving, and a focus on developer empathy. All of these things will serve me well as a member of a development team. Prior to Turing, I was of the belief that software developers operated in isolation. Now, I am excited to contribute to an agile workflow as a contributing member to tackle interesting challenges in a career that will stimulate me intellectually for as long as I desire.
