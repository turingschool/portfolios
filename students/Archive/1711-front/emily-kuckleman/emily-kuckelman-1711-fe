# Emily Kuckelman - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to fully understand the content that was taught. The first time around I felt like I was scrambling to just try and keep up and barely kept my head above the water the entire time. This time around I spent more time outside of class, and on the weekend to work on projects and got to phase 4 on every paired project except the last one.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pretty positive that I passed!


## B: Individual Work & Projects
 * Throughout mod 1 we had 1 personal javascript project and then 3 static composition projects. Number guesser was the first project of the entire mod, and the first time to combine html, css, and javascript to make an application. THe static comps were projects that were meant to make us get stronger in our CSS and HTML skills. WE were given a picture of a comp and told to recreate it. We were allowed to be creative with color and theme, but had to stick to the comp as best as we could.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
These projects were given to us to help us work on our Javascript skills and use the information gained from the lessons, and implement them into working applications. I aimed to get to phase 4 of each project, and did so except for the last project. These projects made us use html and css to re-create the comp that is given in every project description.

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ekuckelman/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

* This project was our first paired project and our first time appending a card full of elements to the page when a submit button is clicked. This project requried a lot more planning and thinking. We had to make sure the inputs had valid content in them. Made buttons that were appended run different functions, and learned how to use jQuery.

##### Evaluator: 
  * Pamela Lovett
##### Notes/What To Work On:
###### OVERVIEW
* All the way through Phase 4!!! You both did great with speaking to your code.
###### DESIGN
* Stays true to the spirit of the comp
* Like the color choices for the counter
* Add spacing between borders and cards. Make sure that the 'Linked List' header is flush with inputs/buttons
* Some work to make it fully responsive - weirdness happening before different media queries
* Ditch the alert for error messaging and find a more elegant solution. Tell the user to know that part of having a valid URL includes having http:// tacked on the front
* Bookmark box falling outside of parent container
###### HTML
  * Good spacing. Keep using semantic tags.
  * Lines 3-39 should be indented two more spaces. Lines 7 & 8 should be one line. Use HTML Style Guide for reference
  * Add aria-labels to inputs and send through screen reader
  * Inputs should have a form around them for accessibility w/keyboard. This allows you to submit with a keypress (as it's currently set up, it only submits on click)
###### CSS
  * Nice job with organizing declarations alphabetically in each selector
  * No need for a 0 margin on body since you are using a reset
  * Overuse of absolute positioning. Typically, you want to use absolute ONLY when you can't get any other positioning to make the layout work
  * Add box-sizing: border-box to override default box-sizing to make sure boxes are the exact width you set.

###### JS
  * Nice job using named functions in event listeners
  * Unclear why event listener is set up on body instead of the link counter div in Line 6
  * Like the focus back to the input on 15 and 22
  * Check for using soft wrap on long lines of code
  * Nice job knowing what this is in your code!! As well as being able to speak to your regex code!
  * Opportunity for some refactoring in event listener for creating card - but good overall!

##### Feedback
  * Overall our Linked-List project was a great success. We started off strong by creating a thorough, collaborative DTR, and sticking very closely to it throughout the project. We practiced both Driver-Navigator coding, as well as working ‘remote’ by using Waffle to create different tasks and then divvying them up to work on individually. You were instrumental in implementing this process in our project, as well as in our use of Git and GitHub. I feel like my grasp on these subjects has improved dramatically after pairing with you on this project. Additionally, we were successful at working through obstacles we would come across during the project. We would struggle through them individually for an appropriate amount of time before asking each other for input on how to overcome the problem, and providing that input in a way that did not steal the other’s learning experience. A challenge we had during the project was that we could have been more thorough with testing out our final iteration of our master branch after all merges had been completed. We might have caught a few of the bugs we came across during our evaluation if we had done so. We were a highly effective pairing for this project, with high levels of effective communication and both being committed to following the outline set in the DTR.

##### Evaluator: 
 * David Whitaker
##### Notes/What To Work On:
###### DESIGN
* content should not get bigger as page becomes smaller, try going mobile first next time
###### HTML
* use aria labels
* store jquery locally
###### CSS
 * consider organizational comments and bem
 * try less in media queries
###### JS
 * pull duplicate blocks into functions
* love that you used a constructor function and especially a method on the prototype!!!
* use more abstractional naming, ie. Idea instead of MakeCard
###### git/gitHub
* get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!

##### Evaluation Scores

###### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
  * Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
###### HTML
  * Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
###### CSS
  * Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
###### JS/jQuery
  * Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
  * Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
  * Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
  * Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
  * Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
  * Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.
 * Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
###### Dom Manipulation
  * Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
 ###### Style
  * Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
###### GIT & GITHUB
  * Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
  * Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
###### Pairing/Collaboration
  * Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

##### Feedback to me
  * Hi! I’m so glad you were my partner this week! I love that we put in time over the weekend to get ahead on the project so we didn’t have to stress about it (too much) during week. You were really encouraging and I think we had a good balance of working together and dividing to conquer. Thanks for suggesting that we use jquery, objects and prototypes and for being patient while I learned all three! I hope I get to work with you again soon and I promise to remember my semi-colons. Next time we should push ourselves to finish all the way through phase 4 right from the beginning and aim high.

##### Notes/What To Work On:
###### OVERVIEW
* 
###### DESIGN
* looks nice, make a container and have children adhere to its width
###### HTML
  * aria-label instead of aria-labelledby
###### CSS
  * make your content adhere to your media queries instead of the other way around. Try to make it work with 3! Wireframe in advance
  * Stick to only using rems for margin and padding, and use percentages and pixels for width
look at bem
###### JS
  * syntax!!!
  * naming conventions - say more - think of everything as an abstraction
  * use your thisarg to provide the context of this in array prototypes
  * check out the style guides

##### Feedback to me
* We rocked that project! I was impressed at how well we worked together. I appreciate how accommodating we were with our time. We had set a schedule and stuck with it well. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for being so meticulous about the filter buttons. The changes you put in made the project look even better. I was ready to call it good enough. I love that you took the reign with javascript. I felt comfortable but given someone with a little less experience, it might be hard for them to keep up. I would suggest in the future discussing your logic first. Overall, we did a great job. I'm super happy with the project. I hope you are too.

## D: Professional Skills
  One of the many great things about Turing is the personal growth that happens while here. As a former teacher, the words professional development usually meant sitting in a gym learning about things that weren't useful or relevant to me. That is not the case with Turing's professional development. These gear ups brought deeper insight to not only how I operate, but also to how people around me operate.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness - growth mindset
  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
  Having a growth mindset was a huge part of this mod since I was repeating. Letting go of my pride and admitting that I needed to repeat mod 1 was a big moment for me and made me realize just how much of a fixed mindset I had gotten myself into. This gear up brought to light the things that I did wrong the first time around. I should have asked for help sooner, I should have admitted when I was stuck or didn't know how to do something, and I needed to keep my healthy habits up to keep my physical and mental health up. I think that it is easy to get stuck in a fixed mindset, especially when in a situation like Turing where you are constantly being challenged to do things that are new and sometimes foreign to you. This session gave me some really good strategies and ideas to make sure that I maintain my growth mindset.
#### Health and Wellness 2
  * This session was all about stress management. Which seemed really important/ironic because it was right as the stress of Turing really started to set in for the entire class. It was very educational. Learned about a lot of different types of stress and how to manage them. I liked this session a great deal this time around. The first time, I was just stressed out about how I was stressed out and was in this awful loop of despair.
#### Mod 4 Leads
  * The session I went to was learning from the struggle. I didn't struggle as much the second time around, but I know that I will come across challenges in future mods that I will need to learn how to make sure I can show grit and get through the struggle. The session had a really great Ted Talk that was all about growth mindset and I thought that it tied in very well with the other gear ups that I attended this mod.
## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
Honestly, didn't really do much outside of my co-hort for community participation. I did a lot within my co-hort though. I was able to use my skills gained from teaching to help my classmates throughout the mod.
