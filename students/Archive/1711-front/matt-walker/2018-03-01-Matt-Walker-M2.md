## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_

My technical focus was to get more comfortable with Javascript, get better at Algorithmic Thinking and Array Prototypes and start familiarizing myself with React. My communication goals were to get better at describing code using the correct terminology and be able to tell my professional story more comfortably. 

## Self-Evaluation
_How do you feel you did in these areas this inning?_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **B: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 3
* **E: Final Assessment**: 3

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I attended every morning Iron-FE that was hosted, which I was happy about and I think it helped me a ton with array prototypes, general programming structures and algorithmic thinking. I can still get better at algorithmic thinking. I want to continue to slow things down and plan what I'm going to do based on all available information, including reading error messages more throughly, then act.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

I think my habits served me well. I like showing up early and running through some exercises, lessons or working on a project to help me start my mind before class begins. I eat a healthy breakfast and try to do Yoga which keeps my body feeling good. These habits help me. 

I still need to work on taking POMs. When I realize I'm stuck, I need to reference the docs, tutorials or articles quicker. Sometimes I will go down rabbit holes for hours that don't serve me well. I still need to get better at time boxing. 

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome: Pass**

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I liked sorting suite. It was challenging and it furthered my understanding of how things under the hood of Javascript work. I know this understanding will be valuable for job applications. 

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style: 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring** 

* **Testing: 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality**

* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP**

* **Functional Expectations: 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.**

* **Code Sanitation: 3**

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I value the lessons that Complete-Me. Going line by line and understanding what the code does really helped with my algorithmic thinking goal.


## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

I liked our group projects. The most challenging part was the language while coding. Both of my partners and I were roughly at the same level and envisioned a similar path to what we want. However, because of new terminology, it was tough to describe what exactly we wanted to do. Often this meant us trying our own thing for 10-15 minutes and then reconvening, where most of the time we brought back similar code. I feel as though both projects went well and we created what we wanted. Both projects were very valuable to me and helped my understanding. 

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Chase
* **Game:** Asteroids
* **Functional Expectations: 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs**
* **User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.** 
* **Testing/Code Sanitation: 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows less than 5 complaints.** 
* **JS Style: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* **Workflow: 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.**

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed learning how HTML Canvas worked and making Objects interact with each other. This is a great project to start Mod 2 with.  

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Maddy
* **Spec Adherence:** Pass
* **User Interface:** Pass++
* **HTML Style:** Pass
* **CSS/Sass Style:** Pass
* **JS/React Style:** Pass
* **Testing:** Pass
* **Workflow:** Pass
* **Code Sanitation:** Pass

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

I enjoyed React and am very excited to build more projects in React. Also, after not having a UI for three weeks, I enjoyed getting back into CSS. I enjoyed working with Maddy.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * Plan for outreach and networking in M3
  * In Person Feedback Conversation Reflection
  * Working Draft of Professional Story
  * Agile

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

I learned how to communicate better with the people in my cohort. I also learned how to craft my personal story. I think the Professional Story and Plan for Outreach and Networking in M3 were particularly valuable. More than half the battle of getting a software engineering job is networking and outreach and the skills shared in these sessions are going to be extremely valuable. 

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * Gear Up 1: Debugging the Gender Gap
  * Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
  * Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

I found all the Gear Up Sessions very valuable. Both Debugging the Gender Gap and the Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think were eye opening. I enjoyed the Case Study with Mod 4 about how to cope with the pressures of Turing and avoid burnout. Identifying the signs of burnout, the reasons why burnout occurs and how to avoid them or remedy your passion were all interesting. We got a session about coping with the stress of Turing in Mod 1, but I liked having stress handling concepts reintroduced in later Mods. 

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

I paired with Mod 1 Students almost every week. It was awesome when we connected and both parties were able to understand each other. Sometimes a connection happened and it felt great to help someone understand their code better. I would like to give a lightning talk at some point during my Turing Career. I wish there was more interest in Interest-based posses because I'd love to help lead one. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_

I am going to spend the break with my girlfriend in the mountains. That connection will help me recharge my batteries. However, I mostly just want to maintain my good habits and stay ahead at Turing. I want to build a lot of projects using React over the break. I want to follow a lot of tutorials, and try to get ahead of Mod 3. This upcoming Mod is main mod at Turing and I want to be as ready for it as possible.
