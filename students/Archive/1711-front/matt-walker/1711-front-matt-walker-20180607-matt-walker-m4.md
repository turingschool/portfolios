#### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

###### My biggest achievement of the module was juggling all the work that was given to us. From trying to remember jQuery for Palette Picker to learning Node/Express/Knex, completing all the projects, the homeworks, the job search, etc. It was a lot to juggle and I'm proud that I was able to juggle it all, turn everything in on-time, and give 100% until the end. If I had to pick one project I am the most proud of, it would be my Capstone. 

#### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

###### My biggest struggle was the first week of this module. I was new to creating and testing servers and I had also forgot a bit of jQuery, so building the Palette Picker project in 5 days was a struggle for me. The struggle reaffirmed that it is impossible to remember code, and that even familiar languages will be forgotten if you don't write in them frequently. I relied on the fact that I can always look up syntax, and that my focus should be knowing how to program logically and, even if it's an overwhelming project given a certain time-frame, I should just solve one problem at a time. Although I was styling at 12:50 PM for a 1PM deadline, I got the project done in time and I was pleased with my performance. 

#### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

###### In terms of projects, I think my Capstone project set myself apart from my peers. It is the closest thing I've built to a real application at Turing. It was a long project and my partner and I had to work hard, daily for 2 weeks to accomplish it. It was great to work with a team of designers and business minds from outside of Turing. We approached the project as if there was a real chance that it could be funded and I think that showed in our work.

###### I also got to school before everyone in my class. I made a schedule in Mod 1 that I would do 90 to 120 minutes of work before class started and I stuck to that schedule for most days through Mod 4. Most days, I was also one of the last people to leave my class. I'm sure all of my classmates are doing work outside of Turing, but this also made me available to help other students at Turing when needed. I helped out lower mod members frequently. 

#### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

###### I liked working in the back end. I definitely prefer the Front End, but knowing how to setup a server and create endpoints was very valuable. I also appreciated the browser focused lessons like PWAs, React Native, Websockets, etc. I may not do any back end work at my job, but I will definitely keep setting up my own servers for personal projects. 

#### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

###### I want to continue focusing on my algorithmic thinking. Taking big problems, breaking them down, and solving one small problem at a time while researching what the proper approach is. I also want to keep my confidence high and try not to be scared of problems. Just reiterating the fact that given the time, I will make it work.  

#### List your cut-off date for having a full-time position
###### I didn't just go through this school to not get a job. I'm going to get a software developer job.
