# Charles Yach - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Mod 1 I set out to create a strong foundation of knowledge upon which I can build on during my time here at Turing and for the rest of my career as a developer.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

My end of module assesments went well. I was strong, but slow, with my DOM manipulation and creature code challenge. My coding was slower due to my desire to be thoughtful and thorough instead of sporatic and chaotic. I also felt very strong about the quiz with uncertainty about only one or two of the questions. I am currently pending my end of module assessment due to an extension for my static-comp-challenge-3.


## B: Individual Work & Projects


During mod 1, there were four individual projects including, Number Guesser, Static Comp 1, Static Comp 2, and Static Comp 3.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/numberguesser/tree/ead4627e371578470646d87c6a3e2ff213459485)
* [GitHubPages URL](https://charlesy712.github.io/numberguesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser tested our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after only one week of classes. The directions were to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The phases then added complexity by adding requirements such as only numbers can be inputted, buttons toggle enabled or disabled, and increasing difficulties for the user. I was focusd on making through all the phases instead of making sure my code was clean and conscise. However, I thoroughly enjoyed making it a four player game!

## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Excellent work getting it to work with 4 players
* In the future, build half a thing, not a half assed thing though - this code would be a nightmare to maintain as is

### comp
* make header as wide as the input

### html
* forms, use them
* use labels for inputs
* separate multiple word classes and ids using kabob case

### css
* avoid redundancies dry it up!!!!

### js
* dry it up!!!!

## Functional Expectations
* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/cy-comp-challenge-1)
* [GitHubPages URL](https://charlesy712.github.io/cy-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comps are inteded to keep our HTML and CSS skills strong while our classes focus on JavaScript. We are provided with a static image and are required to recreate it as a responsive site. We are not given liberties with the layout, but colors, images, and styling is allowed.

My first static comp was a success. Louisa used the phrase "foundationally well built" to describe it. I did have areas to improve on such as making sure my images did not stretch. Also I could have picked better/more media breakpoints to ensure that my blocks didnt jump in size too much when changing. Another learned lesson was to change box sizes to better address mobile usability.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/cy-comp-challenge-2)
* [GitHubPages URL](https://charlesy712.github.io/cy-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static Comps are inteded to keep our HTML and CSS skills strong while our classes focus on JavaScript. We are provided with a static image and are required to recreate it as a responsive site. We are not given liberties with the layout, but colors, images, and styling is allowed.

My second static come was an even better success than the first. Luisa used the same phrase again, "foundationally well built", to describe my comp. I utilized some stratigic media break points to make a very smooth transition that also included layouts for horizontally positioned mobile layouts. My feedback on this comp was to make an even better focus on the interactable buttons when in a small media layout. My mobile layout was fine, but the button size may have been difficult for fat fingers. It was also at this point that it was recommended we use hover and active states for interactive elements.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In this first mod, we had three group projects. They were Linked List, Idea Box, and 2DoBox Pivot. These projects put to test not only our technical skills, but also our partnering skills. It was just as important to work well with other people who may or may not share your strengths, weaknessess, or work styles as it was to complete the requirements.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a paired project and my partner was Keila Hoover. The rubric required two layouts, a desktop and mobile. The basis of the project was to have two input fields for Title and Website, and using these inputs create a list of bookmarked sites. As the phases progressed, the functionality became more complicated such as a "read" button, restricting input values, disabling buttons, and usable links after creation.

## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Super close to being fully responsive
* Try doing mobile first next project

### html
* Add labels to all input fields!

### css
* Consider adding comments for different sections of your css
* Use convention for organization within blocks - ie. idiomatic or alphabetized

### js
* Consider using template literals to simplify appending things to the dom
* Break out similar blocks of code into their own functions and pass dynamic pieces as arguments
* reuse named functions for event listeners

### git/github
* Say more in each commit - as much as you can in 30 seconds or so.

## Functional Expectations
* Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

## Feedback from Partner
“We worked really well together! You’re such a great partner. Your next partner is lucky to have you on their team. Right off the bat, we created a DTR that helped us establish mutual working and communication methods and our schedules. Throughout the project, we efficiently blended our individual approaches to writing our code and how to implement it in to Github. When we ran in to a struggle or roadblock, we talked through the issue, capped the struggle and if we couldn’t figure out the issue, we reached out to the mod ahead of us, a mentor, and our instructors. (in that order) We both seemed to organically (and with communication) fall in to our strengths. As in, you helped me better understand Javascript and I brought in a design-eye and experience that helped with the responsive layout. We both felt uneasy about implementing Git/Github in to our project, but we once again both naturally “hit the ground running” and took the risk so we could grow our skills and knowledge together!

When we are working on a function of the page, your focus on figuring out the issue is highly appreciated. However, the time spent figuring out the issue may need a specific cap time to keep the project rolling.  (i.e. stop the struggle after 30 min) Then we can go back to the struggle and see if we can figure it out after spending time away from it. Overall, you were great to work with and thank you for being so understanding in personal life concerns!  Go us!”

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

For this paired project my partner was Ryan Harrington. Idea Box was a project very similar to Linked List with two input fields creating a list of ideas. However, one of the focuses was providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. We relied on JavaScript and jQuery to implement filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist the ideas between sessions.

## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

### DESIGN/COMP
- Nice job getting as far as you did!
- Some adjustments needed with spacing and font size

### HTML
- Good job with indentation/spacing
- Use  `aria-label` where you are using the `name` attribute for accessibility (using the `aria-label` attribute instead of label elements since you are not using a visible label). Instances where you might use `name` include:
1) allowing inputs to provide their values to the server (of which we have none) on form submission.
2) grouping radio buttons so that only one can be selected at a time.
- Correct your path in line 32 so that jquery loads as backup, if needed
- Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.

### CSS
- Consider adding comments to your CSS for organizatonal purposes
- Good job organizing declarations within selectors alphabetically. Next time, try using [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for organizing declarations
- Don't put units on `0` (line 8) - it's redundant
- Remove commented out code from final submission
- Use ems or rems for font sizes - don't rely on pixel density with so many user devices out there now
- Avoid the use of IDs as CSS selectors to avoid specificity issues when your codebase grows
- Love that you discovered (and implemented) using attributes as CSS selectors. However, see information on `name` (HTML above) as to WHEN you should be using the `name` attribute. Currently, it is an addition that you are using in the same manner that you would use an `id` or `class`.

### JS
- Bs sure you get familiar with your terminology (i.e. template literals, properties, etc)
- Event listeners could be refactored to use named functions instead of anonymous functions
- Don't create a variable  `idea` in line if there is a possibility it will go unused (if the `if` expression evaluates to true). Move around your logic so that a new `Idea` instance is created ONLY when both fields have content.
- Difficult to read through some of the JS functions - for example, the event listeners for editing the title/body. Spacing within functions also adds to difficulty across entire file
- Default to using dot notation when accessing values from static properties (for readability). Also - remove unneccesary parens in expression (See example in line 113 below)
```js
if (parsedIdea.quality === 'quality:swill') {
...
}
```
- Duplicate lines of sending to local storage and showing updated quality text on screen (in event listeners for quality buttons) ...this could be moved out of the conditional to be executed at the end of the function, once the new quality has been assigned
- Event listeners for editing title and body could be refactored into one function
- Good naming on those functions that are named

### GIT/GITHUB
- ALWAYS work on branches
- Nice job being specific in your commit messages!

## Functional Expectations
* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility
* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types
* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.


## Conditional Logic
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.


## Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.


## Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style
* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git
* Novice  Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

## GIT/GIHTHUB
* Novice  Can articulate what GitHub is, how it is different from Git, and why it is important. Can comfortably push and/or pull changes from master.
* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## Feedback from Partner
“Charles, I think we paired very well. Our styles of communication were very compatible and our pace was very well matched. We utilized the driver/navigator method very well. Then our remote style worked very well too. You did an excellent job on the search bar while I was doin responsive css. My advice going forward would be to make sure you switch off with your partner at good intervals. You can tend to put your head down and keep going and going, which is awesome and beats the opposite by a mile, but for the school environment being partnered with someone who’s very soft spoken might not say anything to make sure they get ample time on the keyboard. As a whole, I think we worked very well together and you’ll do great at Turing.”

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CharlesY712/2DoBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox was a great experiment in taking another groups Idea Box and pivoting it into our own project. Without scraping the previous groups code, we were to complete any missing functionality, change it's styling, and building more functionality on top of it. This provided a great experience of not starting from scratch, breaking down and understanding someone else's code, then knowing the code well enough to utilize it in expanded functionality.

## Notes/What To Work On:
- good, thoughtful UI changes
- clean, well refactored CSS. Very nicely done.

## Feedback from Partner
"We made a great team on this project and this is evidenced by the feedback we received during our evaluation.  You are remarkably fast at developing javascript solutions and your commitment to completing the project sooner than later is commendable.  We had a great DTR and I am glad we knocked it out on day 1.  As a result, we both had very clear understandings of each other's expectations.  I was able to work in a manner and on a schedule that suited my working style and I was never forced to make unreasonable compromises.  If we had to do the project again, the only thing that I would want to change is to be more diligent in our testing procedures.  The first 95% of the project was completed with almost a week to spare, but we found ourselves patching bugs well into the evening before our evaluation.  We pulled through, but we could have been more thorough with our solution if we had given ourselves more time.  Overall, I consider this project/pairing a great success!""

## D: Professional Skills
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, the curriculum transcends technical training. We are presented with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community.

Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness and interpersonal skills. Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions, one each on personal growth, team dynamics, and social responsibility.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

This Gear Up was about always having a growth mindset. Many turing students are developed adults that have grown into patterns and set ways. However, we have all come here to make a change in our lives. We need to take that mindset of growing into a new role, and apply that to many aspects of our life. If you believe you are set in your ways and cannot change, this will provide difficulties with both our schooling and future careers.

#### Health and Wellness 2

Health and Wellness 2 did not have a markdown. Kayt Hensley provided me with the two powerpoint presentations.
* Well-Being_Self Care 101
* Well-Being_Stress Managemet 101

This Gear up was about stress and how it affects us. The first powerpoint was about the types of stress, how it affects a person, how to manage it, and what you can do about it. The second powerpoint was about macro and micro self care. It also provided us with remidies to negative stress and provided tips on setting boundries. These two powerpoints really helped me with actionables that can help my sucess.

#### Mod 4 Leads

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1711-inning/Group_5.md)

For this Gear up we split up into groups to have talks that were lead by mod 4 students. My group presented Technology in the Media. This session addressed different technology buzzwords, how they can be confusing, and how to determine truthfulness. After that introduction we had group

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My community involvment revolved around helping students around me. I was always open and willing to help anyone in need. Much of my assistance was focused on GitHub, jQuery, and media responsiveness. I also joined in social events such as the code fair and group gatherings outside of Turing.
