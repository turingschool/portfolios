## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

My biggest achievement for Mod 4 was a better understanding and respect for the back-end of software development. Just being able to dip my toes into various technologies such as Node.js, Knex, Express, and PostgreSQL gave me a "whole circle" view of web apps. I've always believed that knowing a little bit of every piece helps you to excel in your piece, and I've been wanting this since the beginning of Turing.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

The biggest struggle for me was what I like to call coding atrophy. In the first couple of weeks we were required to write our front end code in jQuery. Having not used jQuery since Mod1, it was a rough process. A few things came back very quickly, others needed constant referrals to documentation. But hey, it was 5 months ago, that's not too shabby. However, when it came to my capstone project I chose a react front-end and I couldn't believe it; I couldn't even write a class correctly. I was forgetting syntax and redux processes. This was initially mind boggling. I had never been so disappointed. It had only been a few weeks, why was I struggling so much? Clawing my way through, I did just fine in the end, but this has proven to me that I cannot let my coding slip. In the coming days during the job search I must be diligent with daily practice of multiple languages, libraries, and styles. I will not give in to coding atrophy.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

This inning was a roller coaster of great proportions for me. In the previous mod I had impressed an employer during a job shadow so much that they sought me out for hire. Through a lengthy process that lasted most of the first week of Mod4, I was the very first student of the 1711 cohort to be offered a position. Sadly, the offer was too low even after high-pressure in-person bargaining. What had first put me at the top of the world, had now set me behind in the foundation of my Mod4 learning. I managed to keep up and stay the course to graduate. Now that I have accomplished that, I am sure that the same leadership and coding skills I showed in that job shadow will shine in my job hunt.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

This part of the stack shed light on parts that I new weren't right, but I had no idea what laid ahead. I had known in previous mods that the require projects were shallow. They weren't even hosted anywhere for me to show family or friends. Little did I know that wanting to host a site wasn't a simple click. The next thing you know we've got Travis CI and Heroku, client side security with not one but MANY ways to do so, and different work environments on top of that! With so many things to keep in consideration, wanting to show host my projects just became a huge ordeal... and I love it. I've always wanted a job that worked in a React environment, but now I strive to become a project architect. Being able to structure a project around a clients needs to make sure we are using the best font-end, back-end, authorization, authentication, localization, and workflow for their needs is what will drive me in my future endeavors. 

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

The most important skill that I will take into my next job is how to write code. But seriously, before Turing I already possessed many skills and behaviors that lead to success in a work environment. Skills such as communication, leadership, project management, time management, and problem solving had already been honed over my last 11 years of professional experience. What I needed, and got, from Turing was the hard skills of programming. Starting out with strong foundations in HTML, CSS, and JS, then building on top of them has given me the ability to take my soft skills and focus on a career that is more rewarding than what I previously had. Don't think these new skills are limited to code libraries. Turing has shown me the tools of the trade such as terminal use, github flow, test driven development, and others. All of what was mentioned will help me become the professional I want to be.
