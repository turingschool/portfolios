# Michael Gatewood - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal in M2 is to become familiar with the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming and improve my ability to solve complex problems using algorithmic thinking.  I want to be active in assiting M1 students while maintining my own academic standing.  Finally, I want to continue my professional development and continue to make steps towards being prepared for the job search after I graduate Turing.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects challenged my ability to break complex problems into smaller, manageable, achieveable goals.  Test-driven development was further introduced in individual projects.  Finally, I was able to make great strides in my ability and willingness to solict ideas, assistance, and suggestions from others.  Even with the help of others, these projects were very challenging and I doubt I would have the same level of success without the help of my peers.  I fully intend to continue to use the human resources available throughout Turing when I am presented with a challenge I cannot solve on my own.  If I am to change any behavior in the next mod, it will likely be that I ask for help sooner.

### Study Habits

I spent more time this inning studying and working through problems with others.  While in terms of execution and general study, I work better alone; I am finding that learning from others' knowledge and experience is an invaluable process that cannot be ignored.  Because I was so challenged with these projects, I found it more difficult to read-ahead.  This negatively impacted my learning and created a cycle where I felt like I was constantly playing catch-up.  In M3, I will place this priority above all others.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** Pass

The goal in completing the Sorting Suite project was to develop sorting programs using the principles of bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort and merge sort. While I enjoyed the challenge overall, the lack of incremental wins created a lot of stress and struggle.  In comparison, Game Time was a matter of implenting a feature and moving on to the next.  For Sorting Suite, I felt like that I didn't fully grasp what every algorithm was doing until the morning of the evaluation.  Had the evaluation been only a few hours sooner, I would not have been comfortable writing the code.  However, I think the struggle provided me with a better overall understanding of the concepts and I am grateful to be able to take this knowledge with me into an interview and explain each methodolgy with confidence.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 3

CompleteMe is an application that uses a prefix trie to suggest words based on letters entered by the user.  This was another challenging project that my cohort more-or-less treated like a class project.  This was the moment where the cohort came together as a team and leaned on each other to get through the project.  Without the teamwork of the entire class, the struggle would be magnified exponentially.  Even with the support of classmates, however, this was a project that never truly came together until the end, much like Sorting Suite.  What I take with me from this project is camaradere with my cohort, another step towards a succesful interview, and a tool to use in my Weathrly project (and others?).

## B: Group Work & Projects

The group projects in this module were significantly greater in scope and challenge when compared to M1.  Both projects were developed using newly learned technologies and required a greater emphasis on testing.  My group projects provided the opportunity to further diversify my techniques in working with other people of varying work styles and expertise.  Both projects were exercises in give and take where both partners had to accomodate their preferred working style for the better of the team.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** Om Saetehn
* **Game:** Tron
* **Functional Expectations:** 
* **User Interface:** 
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 
* **JS Style:** 
* **Workflow:** 

GameTime was a project where we were required to develop a game using Canvas, JavaScript, and es6 classes.  Working with canvas was my favorite part of Game Time.  I enjoyed the process of putting together canvas objects on the screen...one dot at a time...then later developing algorithms to develop more complex pieces.  Animating the screen was a lot of fun as well.  This project required a lot of practice in algorithmic thinking as the animation portion required tackling many smaller milestones; sometimes just trying to move a dot from one spot on the scrren to another.  I also made a lot of compromises in my pairing and my patience was tested repeatedly (not because of my partner, but because of my preferred work style).  Because of this, I came out of this pairing a better partner than I was going in and we were both very happy with the end product.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** Sabrina Kennedy
* **Spec Adherence:** 
* **User Interface:** 
* **HTML Style:** 
* **CSS/Sass Style:** 
* **JS/React Style:** 
* **Testing:** 
* **Workflow:** 
* **Code Sanitation:** 

The goal of Weathrly was to create a weather forecast that included current weather conditions, a seven-hour forecast, and a ten-day forecast based on user input of either a city or zip code.  My favorite part of Weathrly was becoming familiar with React and learning to work with data from an API.  I had a great partner and we still struggled a lot!  However, we communicated effectively and worked extremely hard to put together a viable product.  This was by far the most practical application I had developed to-date.  The most challenging part of Weathrly for me was incorporating Complete Me and writing tests.  Working with Complete Me again was frustrating because as a stand-alone app, it "just worked."  Writing tests was challenging because we were no longer simply testing data.  Validating that x equals y is much easier than verifying that something is rendered, mocking functions, and simulating user interaction.  I feel much stronger in testing than I did coming into M2, but I feel that I still have a long way to go in this respect toward becoming a productive developer.

## C: Professional Skills

Two of the gear-ups this inning were focused on diversity in general and gender diversity specifically.  Our last gear-up, conducted by M4 dove into the pros and cons of working for different types, sizes, and maturity of companies.  Our projessional development sessions started with another lesson on promoting yourself through conversation, then in warm and cold outreach.  Feedback II continued the trend of practicing good techniques in giving and receiving feedback and Jeff lead a session on agile practices in development.

### Professional Development

#### Agile Practices and Leadership

This class was a good opportunity to have a more clear idea on exactly what agile practices entail and how Turing as an organization practices and promotes those practices.  I didn't know it before this lesson, but I am a big believer in the idea and I use similar practices in my workflow, continuously communicating changes and adjusting the plan accordingly.

#### Feedback II

Feeback II built upon what we had learned in M1 and had been practicing since.  Now we were introduced to some techniques specific to giving verbal feedback.  Since attending this lesson, I have become more aware of my own non-verbal communication and am making a concerted effort to control these behaviors in order to maximize my effectiveness in communicating kind and constructive feedback to others.

#### Storytelling II

This lesson was on being able to succintly and authoratatively pitch your professional story in a manner that grabs the listener's attention and conveys yours strengths, experience, expertise, and goals.  So often, there is a tendancy to give a chronological narrative of your professional carreer or going to the other extreme and not sharing enough.  The goal is to leave an impression in the listerner's mind of where you're looking to go and the value you can add to an organization. 

#### Outreach and Networking

The Outreach and Networking less provided various methods to increase your network.  This includes networking with peers, faculty, staff and alumni at Turing; going to meetups and engaging with others in your industry; and cold outreaches to people of interest in your field.  Networking is not something that comes naturally to me or even something that I'm really comfortable with, so I appreciate any tips I can get in that regard.

### Gear Up Sessions:

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

This session discussed gender inequality in the tech industry.  Not having been exposed to the community before, I was surprised to learn that this was an issue in modern day.  The one thing that stuck in my mind was learning that gender diversity in the industry was had reached highs in the 1980s to the extent of an almost 50/50 split between men and women.  While I'm disappointed with where we are today, I take comfort in knowing that this is a problem capable of being solved, as evidenced by the past.

#### Parable of the Polygon

This session was held to discuss the idea that people want to be surrounded by similar people and how quickly this behavior can negatively impact a community by compounding itself.  As it turns out, bias begets bias.  We have to be cognizant of this pattern in order to avoid it spiralling to a point where diversity is non-existant.  A good way to improve diversity in the workplace is to educate people on the virtues of multiple perspectives and experiences.  I would be interested to learn if anyone has ever conducted a study that correlates diversity to something quantifiable like profit margins.  Some examples of poor testing come to mind as events tied to lack of diversity that also cut into margins. 

#### What's Your Flavor of Shit Sandwich?

This session provided some interesting perspectives of working at different types of organizations in order to better tailor where it is that we (think we) want to work.  They discussed small vs medium vs large size; on-site vs remote; start-up vs mature businesses; agency vs product companies.  While the lesson was insightful, I had previously done extensive research to determine that my ideal environment was a small start-up (not necessarily tech) where I can fill multiple roles and have a greater impact on the organization.  This session was a great opportunity to confirm somet of the things that I want in a future employer. 

## Community Participation

Coming into M2, I made myself available for pairing every weekday and had several opportunities to help M1 students with JavaScript and OOP related questions and challenges.

## Final Assessment

I look forward to M3 with an interest in learning to master React and become efficient enough in writing tests that I can finally allow my tests to drive my development.  I intend to spend my intermission week reinforcing the skills I learned in M2.  While I feel prepared to take on the challenge of M3, I need to build additional muscle memory with array/object prototypes and some of the foundational knowledge of es6 and OOP.  I also need to recalibrate my family/school balance by spending some valuable time with my wife and son before diving full steam into M3.
