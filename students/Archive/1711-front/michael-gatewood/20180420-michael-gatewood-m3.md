# Michael Gatewood - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal in M3 is to become more knowledgeable in React, Redux, and fetching data from APIs.  While Weatherly in Mod2 was a nice introduction, I would like to get in enough repetitions to where I am able to implement React and Redux without thinking about it.  I would like to better understand promises and how they relate to fetching data from APIs.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Mod 3 projects were heavily focused on React and fetch calls.  Other concepts such as Router, Redux, postgreSQL, and middleware were also introduced and applied throughout the module.

#### swAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mngatewood/swappibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

##### Description

This project was a challenge for me because I felt confused about making api calls and this required us to return multiple promises at once and call multiple endpoints. We received a lot of information in this first week and it was a challenge for me to keep up with the pace.  Testing fetch was a complete myth as far as I was concerned.  Consequently, I struggled through this project and was unable to complete all iterations.

##### Evaluation Comments

* Don't fetch everything on load
* Use spread operator instead of push
* Destructure props
* Modularize file structure
* Improve significantly or repeat

##### Evaluation Scores

* Specification Adherence: 2
* Code Quality: 2.5
* CSS/Design: 3
* Testing: 2
* PropType Implementation: Fail
* README Updates: Pass
* Code Sanitation: 3
* Workflow: 3

#### Bar Builder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mngatewood/bar-builder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

##### Description

Bar Builder was my personal/self-directed project for Mod 3 and my first opportunity to build an app that solves a real problem.  The requirements for this project were that it fetches data from an external API and uses React, Redux, and Router.

The Bar Builder is an application that allows users to view cocktail recipes in a variety of ways. In addition to browsing via three filters and search functionality, users can select ingredients that they own (Inventory) to see what drinks they can make with what they have (Bar Menu). The application fetches recipes from The Cocktail DB API. Future iterations will include the ability to create an account in order to persist the user's inventory and bar menu.

##### Evaluation Comments

* Minimize initial fetch calls; fetch only what the user requests
* Implement more sad path tests
* Test each prop in MSP and MDP separately
* Group similar functions into a single file in a logical manner
* Implement a "loading" gif
* Hide filters on inventory and menu pages 

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 4-
* CSS/Design: 3+
* Code Quality: 3+
* Redux Architecture: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4
* PropType Implementation: Pass
* README Updates: Pass
* Testing: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mngatewood/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

##### Description

HeadCount was our first small group project in Mod 3.  During this project, I gained a better understanding of React and Router concepts and got some more practice using OOP to solve problems. 

HeadCount is an application that allows the user to compare educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. This project was designed to improve our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. The goals of the project were to separate application logic into small, testable functions and to write meaningful unit and integration tests. The team members on this project were Maddy Dannenberg, Jared Eklin and Michael Gatewood.

##### Evaluation Comments

* Destructure stats.enrollment for readability
* Don't use CSS classes in JS to give elements properties
* Use snapshots with and without selected cards
* Mock API calls and test the state change
* Use describe to split up tests in a logical manner
* Mock data should be more representative of real data
* Great job on UI

##### Evaluation Scores

* Specification Adherence: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* CSS/Design: 4
* Testing: 3
* PropType Implementation: Pass
* README Updates: Pass
* Code Sanitation: 4
* Workflow: 3+

#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mngatewood/movie-tracker2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

##### Description

Movie Tracker was another small group project that allowed me plenty of opportunity to strengthen my understanding of React and Router and to implement Redux.  I worked very closely with my partner to gain a better understanding of testing.  By the end of this project, I felt very confident in my ability to implement React, Router, and Redux.  Testing was still a challenge, but I felt I was making progress.

My Movie Tracker is an application that allows users to view information (title, overview, average rating) on the latest movie releases. Users may create an account in order to save and view favorite movies. The app fetches movie data from The Movie Database API and user data is stored on a backend server using postgreSQL.

##### Evaluation Comments

* Context is lost by throwing "New" error
* Separate helpers from API calls
* Create separate tests for each reducer
* Limit assertions to one per test
* Destructure props
* Test each prop in MSP and MDP separately
* Do not use boilerplate README; include names and GitHub links
* Great UI!

##### Evaluation Comments

* Specification Adherence: 4
* Code Quality: 3+
* CSS/Design: 4
* Testing: 3+
* PropType Implementation: Pass
* README Updates: Pass
* Code Sanitation: 4

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod3_Week1_Microaggressions_update.md)

The way I understood microaggressions from this session is they can be similar to bias - subtle, unconscious thoughts that take form in hurtful actions. This session explored sources of microaggressions and how they might present themselves. Besides the standard bias in sex, race, religion, and age, this session also explored socioeconomic background and family structure.

#### GroupThink

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Rotation_Session_Groupthink.md)

My first Gear-Up session was on an idea known as GroupThink.  GroupThink is the tendency for members in a given group to gradually drift toward the same beliefs and styles of thinking. It can be harmful to your team effectiveness, to your products, and ultimately to the individuals on your team.  We reviewed what it is,reviewed examples, and discussed ideas on how to mitigate it.

#### Mindfulness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1803-inning/Mindfulness_In_Practice.md)

This Gear-Up sessiong was a discussion and practical exercise on mindfulness.  Mindfulness can mean different things to different people.  To me, it is focusing all of our attention to our body and senses in order to bring us back to the present.  We discussed different ways to use mindfulness to reduce stress and practiced several stretching techniques.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended Wrap-Ups and community events such as demos and SAB events.  I was also an active participant in all retros.  I tried to be helpful to lower mods.  However, this was a tough module for me and with a slow start out of the gate, I needed to focus most of my energy on learning the material and being promoted to Mod 4.
