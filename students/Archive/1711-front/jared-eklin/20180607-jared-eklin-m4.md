## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Understanding servers and gaining a basic understanding of databases were probably my two biggest achievements this module. I had basically no idea how a server worked before this mod and I went from being intimidated by them to viewing them as really awesome tool. With databases, I began the mod with very little understanding of them and left feeling pretty confident in my ability to deal with whatever challenges the particular dataset may present.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
My biggest struggle was trying to balance the job hunt with the workload.  I also struggled with writing, I really dislike writing and trying to write cover letters or say a "blog" post is incredibly time consuming and frustrating for me.  I also felt the Turing grind catch up to me this mod.  I definitely started to feel burned out and just generally tired this mod which I believe to be related to being in the seventh month of Turing and anxiety about the job search.

I also struggled with exposure to so many new concepts this mod.  I generally struggle with the high level concepts until I can take a deeper dive into the material. We moved so quickly between concepts I don't feel like I can explain many of them in much detail.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I made a cheese plate, I have my own Cafe

I think I may have more interest in databases than many of my classmates. Using a join table in the capstone really opened up my eyes on how powerful databases can be. I also think that I am good teammate and someone that people enjoy working with

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Really helped solidify my understand the verbs in the fetch requests and I feel I have a much clearer understanding of the request response cycle.

I struggled before coming to Turing with whether or not I wanted to join the FE or BE program.  In the end, I'm very happy that I choose the front end program but mod4 has opened up my eyes to how cool the back end can be. It definitely has made me lean more towards a full stack career path. 

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
- Confidence in my ability to learn new technologies
- Knowing you can learn things in short amount time.
- The ability to effectively work with people
- Confidence to try something new / scary
- Learned I really like coding!
