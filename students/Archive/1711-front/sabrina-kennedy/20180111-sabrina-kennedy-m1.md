# (Sabrina Kennedy) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module my goal was to get confident in my abilities as a developer, I wanted to build a solid understanding and foundation for vanilla js, jquery, objects and using array prototypes. I wanted to learn and understand the reason behind using and implementing these concepts. My goal for this module was to stay ahead of the curve of the tight schedule and projects, My goal for next module is to keep my daily practice of codding that I did this module and working on smaller pieces of code that I don't understand so I can solve the issues that come up in an effective way.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I am ready to move on to Mod 2. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individuals projects where Number guesser, which was our first project and 3 static comps that used CSS and HTML that were spread out over the last part of this mod.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/number-Guesser-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was created using vanilla javascript. The project that was given was to create a webpage that users could guess a number between 0 to 100, and the game generated a random number. When the user entered a guess the site would inform the user if their guess was too high or too low depending on what the random number was. 

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

DESIGN:
  Stays true to the spirit of the comp

HTML:

  Good use of semantic HTML, spacing, and indentation
  Great job with ARIA and YAAAAYYY for using screenreader to check!

CSS:

  Use Idiomatic CSS for organization

JS:

Opportunities for refactoring but good job overall

#### Static Comp:1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/SK-1711-static-comp-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was a challenge to use only HTMl and CSS to build a static site that looked like the comp that was provided. This project we could change the overall design of the static comp as long as it kept the same nature of the original comp given. We were also asked to make it responsive to mobile views.

#### Static Comp:2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/-SK--comp-challenge--2-)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project was a challenge to use only HTMl and CSS to build a static site that looked like the comp that was provided. This project we could change the overall design of the static comp as long as it kept the same nature of the original comp given. We were also asked to make it responsive to mobile views. 

#### Static Comp:3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod our projects worked with vanilla js and jquery creating list-items that were dynamically created on the page by user information, the information was stored in the local storage to keep the information persist on refresh the page. These projects required the use of transversing the dom to remove dynamically created elements. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project created a site that a user can link-pages and create bookmarks of sites that they want to visit. It was written in all vanilla js. It dynamically created the information, allowed the user to delete the element and dynamically toggled a class of read to the element which kept count of the number of cards on the page and the number of cards with the toggled class.

Notes/What To Work On:

OVERVIEW

YAY for getting through all of Phase III AND writing easy-to-follow vanilla JS!!!

DESIGN

Links not redirecting on cards
Give users error messaging to indicate that both fields must be submitted in order to make a card. Also - syntax error on Line 66 allows edge cases where cards can be created without both fields completed
Pretty responsive! Mobile is too big... minor adjustments on sizing there and fiddling with the header throughout. Err on the side of being nit-picky

HTML

Good indendation and spacing. YAY for ARIA, alt, labels. Add a lang attribute to HTML
Looks good overall

CSS
YAY for idiomatic CSS!!!
Totally okay to use reset or normalize files even though we hadn't covered these topics before this project launched -- would highly recommend using them. This helps you avoid declarations where you are undoing base default styles... also increases cross-browser compatibility

JS
Love that you used vanilla JS for this project to solidify your learning!!!
Most of the naming looks good - readySecondaryButtons threw me off initially, though
Good use of paramenters/arguments to avoid some global vars
Good job breaking apart functionality

GIT/GITHUB
Like that you are using branches to work on features.
Capitalize first letter in commits. Stay concise and descriptive with commit descriptions

feedback to me from Pairing:

"Sabrina! I’m super thankful I was able to pair with you. I believe we crushed the project. I know that we didn’t get to phase four and it wasn’t perfect, but I learned a lot and that had a lot to do with you. You were vary patient through all of my questions. You accommodated my schedule and you went at a pace that I can keep up with which I strongly appreciate. I know that you were self-conscious about the speed and me keeping up which translated to asking me “you are ok?” all the time. Although it was very considerate, I felt I must have resting, confused face. I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank-you for the time you put into helping me understand min/max width, creating child elements and appending them as well as how to get the stupid “read” counter to work. You were very thorough in your explanations. Something that helped me a lot was using examples and tying it into the bigger picture. I think you can do more of that in the future with your upcoming partners as well as figure out different ways to explain a concept. Overall, it was a great experience pairing with you.”

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project used jquery and local storage the information persist the data on reloading the page. dynamically created cards with users ideas on them. The project used transversing the dom, to find the elements, create them, retrieve and store in local storage.

feedback to me from Pairing:

“During our project, you really helped us get past challenges because you always keep calm and collected. Our communication has been without any issues. We set reasonable times to work together at school and outside classroom, and got things done! I  think we really maintain a good teamwork spirit, passing the wheel back and forth, and you’re generous when it comes to opening up to ideas and helping others. It’s inspiring to see how you tackle problems, your solid understanding of JSON makes coding logic much more enjoyable. I really like how you approach the project in a much more organized way than I did in the past. Working with you has taught me a lot. I will keep it up and pass it on! It was awesome working with you, thank you for encouraging me to keep learning!“

#### 2DOBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/2DoBox-Pivot-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project we inherited a repo from another student and had to pivot their idea-box project into a 2-do-box. the project had to fix the code that we inherited, bring it up to par with the specs of the original project and then pivot the code into a smaller but different project. We used jquery, array prototypes to collect the information and refactor the code to keep functions small and single functionality.

Notes/What To Work On:

comp: looks nice, make a container and have children adhere to its width

html:
aria-label instead of aria-labelledby

css:

make your content adhere to your media queries instead of the other way around. Try to make it work with 3! Wireframe in advance
Stick to only using rems for margin and padding, and use percentages and pixels for width
look at bem

js

syntax!!!
naming conventions - say more - think of everything as an abstraction
use your thisarg to provide the context of this in array prototypes
check out the style guides

feedback to me from Pairing:

"I was so excited when I got paired with Sabrina for this project! We both had a pretty good grasp on JS concepts at the beginning of the project and it was very fun to work through this project together. Sabrina did a really great job clarifying things that I wasn't 100% sure about. We were able to work through the dumpster fire of media queries together, even though we both got so frustrated that we wanted to "throw our computer in the river." The only thing that I can think of for Sabrina to work on is something that I too need to work on, which is to set the 3 main css layouts and then go from there.



## D: Professional Skills


Turing goal is produced, well-rounded developers. Not only developers that can write well thought out code but also developers that our thought-provoking  and open minded in themselves and in the community they work in. 

### Gear Up

#### Dealing with Difference: Introverts and Extroverts)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This session made us think about different working styles for introverts vs extroverts. It had use scale ourselves on the scale of introverts and extroverted. This session made me think about how working with my fellow classmates that are more introverted would require a different approach than the ones that are extroverted. I found this to be true with my pairing experience. For my partners that had more introversion, they took longer to think about the problem more internal, then brainstorming out loud, like some extroversion partners did. 

#### health and wellness 1

* [GitHub URL]()no markup

This session we learned about how stress is handled in your body and how it can have an impact on your ability to work effectively. We took a test to measure our own stress levels, and I found that I had a large amount of stress, and learned better ways to handle it while at Turing.

#### health and wellness 2
* [GitHub URL]()

This session went into depth about stress management and ways that you can manage your overall stress levels and the effects it had on you and your environment. I found this gear up beneficial because not only did it talk about managing stress, but it gave us tools to use to help with our stress levels.




#### mod-4: community gear-up Just be cause you can should you?

This gear up dealt with the ethics of teaching and specifically, we talked about the ethical issue when Apple was asked by the FBI to break into the code to get information for the shooter in California. It was a really interesting gear up that made me think about how I myself would handle ethics as a developer and user information. 


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I attended JCS meetings, went to ironFE in the morning and meet with fellow students in the class and help them understand some of the fundamentals of the projects and lessons we worked on over the mod.
