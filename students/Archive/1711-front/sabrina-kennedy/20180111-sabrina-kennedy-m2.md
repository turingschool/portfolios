 YOUR NAME - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

_My goal for this module was to keep my daily practice of coding that I did in module one. Learning how to break down more complex problems into small logical bits that seemed more solvable and building a solid foundation to walk into module 3 feeling strong. I want to work on going slower in my evaluations going forward so I don't make silly mistakes because of my nerves._

## Self-Evaluation
_ I think that I did well with my daily practice of code and learning at how to look at the bigger picture to solve more complex problems, I want to continue to work on this to become a stronger developer as I move into mod-3_

* **A: Individual Work & Projects**: 3+
* **B: Group Work & Projects**:  3+
* **C: Professional Skills**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**:  4
* **E: Final Assessment**: _0 - 4_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_I feel like overall I performed well this module with personal projects and group projects. Both of my group projects went really well and my partner and I were able to work well and collaborate together to solve complex problems in new areas. I want to keep working on making all my projects and tests written in clean, single functionality linear methods._

### Study Habits

_This module my study habits stayed the same as they did in module one. I was able to keep up my daily practice of coding and working on project during the week_

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_ I enjoyed working as a team to solve the problem. I think as a class we worked well together and were able to solve the problems. This project was interesting to work with a larger group than with just one partner like in Weatherly and game time. This project help with break down larger problems into smaller parts. It helps to have a solid understanding what sorting array prototypes do under the hood._

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _3
* **Testing:** _3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _4
* **Functional Expectations:** _3
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_I found this project to be the hardest project for me this module. I had a hard time figuring out what the trie and nodes where suppose to do for the application and how it would break down into further bits. It helps in understanding complex problems and learning how to solve them. This project helps me have an understanding of classes and methods._

## B: Group Work & Projects

_I think overall the group work and partner work went well. I. have learned how to be a better listener and that my method is not the only way to address the problem. I have learned how to take feedback and collaborate on larger projects with groups and individuals_

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Ngoc Phan_
* **Game:** _Break Out_
* **Functional Expectations:** 3+
* **User Interface:** 3+
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** 3
* **JS Style:** 3+
* **Workflow:** 3+

_I thought this was a fun project overall. I enjoyed working on canvas and using js to render a game. Collision detection was a challenge for us in this project. This project helps build a solid understanding of breaking js files into module classes and how class and opp programming  works. I help me learn how to look at functions and classes into smaller bits_

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Michael Gatewood_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_This project was fun getting into a new language for the first time and learning how to work with react, jsx and testing react. It was a challenge writing test and learning how components work with passing information with props and states.
I think this project help build the foundation to move into mod-3_

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile Practices & Leadership
      Feedback II
      Storytelling II
      Outreach & Networking_

_I learned about agile and waterfall development which was helpful in understanding how the real development world works. I learned that I have a hard time telling my professional story and made me think of what I want to say to future and when I am job hunting what I want to say._

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Gear Up 1: Empathy & Privilege
    Gear Up 2: Parable of the Polygon/Automation/Group Think
    Gear Up 3: Case Study with Mod 4_

_ I thought the polygon gear up was really interesting and it was a well put together presentation on the topic that I have not seen in the past. I also really like the mod-4 gear up that I went to. It dealt with breaking down the different types of job options like remotes start-up vs corporate. this one provided props and cons to each type and it helps me identify with what I would like as an ideal job when I am hunting._

## Community Participation

_ This inning I felt like I was more involved in the community then I have before. I participated in iron, Joan Clark, helping mod-1 with pairing one-on-one and helping lead creature lessons. I also was part of SAB. It was nice to be more involved and feel like I am part of the overall whole of turning._

## Final Assessment

_I would like to get stronger at understanding react and testing. I plan to keep to work on solving problems on codewar. I am looking forward to building more real-life applications that are useful. I am going to go climbing and go for a hike._
