###Requirements:


###following questions:

What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Learning new frameworks and technologies, gaining understanding in how all the information that we have been working on since mod-1 work together and getting a solid understnding in that process. Learning new technologies like leaflet and data mapping technologies, learning how to build large databases and working with large datasets. 

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My capstone provided the most struggle working with such a large dataset and getting the information that was needed. We learned a lot about how to work with leaflet to make a data set more interesting when we did not have a lot of help with docs and figuring out how it works. overall this project was one of the hardest I had worked on and got the least amount done. dealing with the balance of job hunting and mod-4 workload. 


What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

This inning I finished working on a side project for NERL that I have been working on since Mod-2. This project has taken a large amount of time building a site that worked for the client and had many changes over the last 6 months. We finished the capstone working on a data visualization for the client to finish the project.


How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

getting a full understanding of how everything works with the front end and back end, It was a lot of fun to have a better understanding of how it all works together. getting understanding in databases. I thought this would be my least favorite mod and was suprised how much I enjoyed the material.

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

being able to learn quickly, and able to teach myself new frame works. I was able to work with new concepts and cutting veggies is important.

### action steps for 30 Day Plan

Action Step #2: Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?

I would like to have an offer signed by August, the 30-day plan is reflective of this goal.

#### networking action steps:

Action Step #1: Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.

I want to reach out to Autin Fraser company that is hiring, Proofpoint, and havenly. I would like to connect with 1-2 people a week while I am job hunting. I will email and reach out starting next week. to set up times for the following week to meet for coffee. 

Action Step #2: Find 3 new meetups or other career networking events to join during your first 30 days post-grad and describe why you'll attend those particular events. How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? If you're interested in speaking at any of these meetups, describe how you'll connect with the organizers to arrange that and give a brief (2-3 sentences) pitch on what you might talk about and why.

I plan to use LinkedIn and meetup to find events with meetup for places that I would be interested in going to. I have mixed feelings about the benefit of going to meetups, I have had more benefits from meeting with coffee vs going to meetups, I will attend cold outreach to help me with this feeling. 

### job/company research

Action Step: Show how you've set up jobtrack.io to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, what next steps you'll take to follow-up, and anything you might do differently next time. Be prepared to describe this system to your instructors during your portfolio review.

I have been talking to a few companies and have moved on to the interview process with a few. I need to reach out to some companies that I am interested in and keep moving forward within job track.

### interview prep

Action Step: Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills. If you plan on setting up more mock interviews, identify who you will set those up with and by what date.

I want to work on doing code challenges every day and to improve my whiteboard and problem-solving skills. I would also like to build up my skills in other areas, like learning angular and learning more as concepts. 

### housekeeping

[alumni site](https://www.turing.io/alumni/sabrina-kennedy)

Action Step: Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30 days post-grad and be prepared to discuss this with your instructors at your portfolio review.

I would like to participate in hackathons or open source projects while I am job hunting. 

### check-in

Action Step: Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. Consider how you might continue to utilize your PD Peer Groups. Describe why you will check in with this person, how you will check in with them, what you aim to talk about, and what you hope to get out of these check-ins to benefit your job search.

I am going to check in with Maddy and Aldo to hold each in out job hunt and  I would like to use them as a method to keep me motivated while I am looking for work. 

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers

Action Step: Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.

Some barriers I have to the job hunt is not feeling comfortable with the problem-solving code challenges. I want to work on getting better at them to help me get over this barrier. I also have a big barrier going to networking events, I have not found them to be beneficial and feel like I have had more benefit with coffee meetings. I want to make myself go to at least 1 or 2 meetups in the next 30days.
