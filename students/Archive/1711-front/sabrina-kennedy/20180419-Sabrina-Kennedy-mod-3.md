# Sabrina Kennedy - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to work on having a solid understanding of React, Redux, and testing in these environments. I also wanted to get comfortable working on larger projects in a smaller timeframes, and still produce clean code. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4/3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4/3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4-
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of the mod-assesment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod we worked on a few diffrent individual projects working with React, Redux and pulling in the data from a api. 

#### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/SWapi-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


This was an individual project to make a Star Wars facts application. A user can come to the page and get information about the people, vehicles, and planets of the Star Wars universe. Each card has a favorites button, that when clicked, will add that card to favorites which can be viewed on a separate page. Data comes from the Star Wars API:https://swapi.co/documentation.

### Skywatch: 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/sky-watch)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This was a two week personal project built for the Turing School of Software and Design, using React.js, React-Router, Redux, and Google Firebase. The idea and implementation of this application was created and carried out on an individual basis. As a person that is excited about the technologies of SpaceX, I wanted to build an App that was an educational and got users about advances in SpaceX is doing for space travel. I built this App using the SpaceX API and youTube API


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod we worked on projects in teams of three working with React and Redux.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/skenne21/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)


HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.
Code Quality
3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
Testing
3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
README Updates
Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.
Surprise and Delight
3 - Hot Fire)

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://https://github.com/skenne21/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Specification Adherence
3+ - The application completes all 2 iterations.
Code Quality
3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
Testing
4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
README Updates
Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
5. Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Redux Architecture
4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing
4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
Workflow
4- - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

We learned about the diffrence between intent and impact. Even if your intent was not ment to be harmful if the impact is taken that way, it has a bigger impact. Its important to be aware of what you say.

#### Group Think

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md)

this gear up we talked about the thoughts that are created from groups and the need to have more diverse populations to remove group thought. 

#### Mod 4 Lead:

* [GitHub URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023)

this session was on the need for digital-privacy and things that you can  do to protect your own  


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I lead retro and was in SAB, I participated in the community focus group on improving stress levels for students while at Turing
