## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I worked on personal growth. My goal for each project was to learn as much as I can over just finishing it. 

#### (Number Guesser)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(description)
We were tasked with building a number guesser. If you guess the right number you won, if you didn't you just keep on guessing till you get it right. I started the two person verison but I have not finished it yet.  

(evaluation comments)
Most of the feed back I got was on my design. Font weights and lenghts of things were my biggest feedback. And I need to remove the console logs before presenting and fix the layout so the event listeners are at the top of the page.

(description)
Linkedlist was our first paired project. Om and I learned so much on this project. Writing jquery for the first time was hard but it quickly turnned out amazing for our first pass. We actaully started over the day before the due date to write but better clean code. 

(evaluation comments)
Pay more attention to the spec - make sure everything is done exactly as specified
Time boxing - once you've been on a problem for 30 minutes, ask for help
Work on technical vocab while pairing
comp
 Would like to see some responsiveness
 Consider doing mobile first for next project
html
 remove unneeded code
 add labels to input elements
css
 good job idiomatically organizing in blocks
 Could consider adding comments for different sections of css for better organization
js
 Good job starting over after struggling on a file with unneccessary code.
 Go back to spec and check things off in the future to make sure that you're meeting the spec
git/github
 Would like to see more commits and more commits. For a project of this length at least 50 or so.
 Would like to see an even number of commits from each contributor

(feedback to me)
“We worked so hard through all the challenges together this week. I like that we bounced ideas back and forth so that we’re both working and learning. I appreciated that you pointed out my mistakes and that you suggested me to use Chrome Dev Tool or console.log more. When we got cranky because we couldn’t solve problems, we pushed through. I’d like to encourage you to use specific terms while coding together, it doesn’t have to be perfect technical language, just utilizing what we know to describe that term. It will come naturally if we keep practicing teamwork communication. Even though many times we feel like we got lost, your input and effort have been the most helpful. It was awesome working with you!”


###(IdeaBox)

  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/ideaBox)
  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

  (description)
  Our task was to create a place to add new items for ideas. You can rate each idea with a quailty and filter through them as well.

  (evaluation comments)
  DESIGN/COMP
Application is not responsive. Satisfies the basic functional expectations for the project. Quality does not persist.
HTML
Get rid of unnecessary spacing between lines
Good job using labels - next time use aria-label attribute on inputs instead of label elements (since you are not using a visible label)
Nice job using landmark roles for ARIA. It would be more appropriate for the section that contains your inputs to be given the role of form (and be housed within a form) instead of the role of banner. See this W3C link for information on what is considered a banner.
Inputs should have a form around them for accessibility w/keyboard. This allows you to submit with a keypress (as it's currently set up, it only submits on click)
Be sure to run your app through a screen reader every time - although the main form is okay, the dynamically generated cards are not accessible.
CSS
Nice work alphabetically organizing declarations within selectors
Next time, try using Idiomatic CSS for organizing declarations
Add box-sizing: border-box to override default box-sizing to make sure boxes are the exact width you set.

Use reset or normalize file to avoid declarations where you undo default styles (lines 6-8)
Note that setting the font-size in px (line 2) runs into accessibility issues - as it will override any browser settings set by the user. Setting this to a percentage avoids this. 75% would be the equivalent of 12px. See this article for a more detailed explanation
Be sure that your flex properties are doing what you want. You are using the align-self property in several places where it isn't actually doing anything to the layout
JS
Nice job speaking to your code!
Be sure to use var before initializing your variable i in the loop on line 12
You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage like in line 15. One unique card object should be instantiated upon creation (line 24). That same unique object can be pulled from localStorage and appended to the page without calling new
Be sure to remove any commented out code/broken functionality before submitting final product
Nice work building prototype methods from Card!
Put qualityArray (line 68) inside your constructor function so that every card has it's own quality array.
GIT/GITHUB
Be sure to follow conventions of capitalizing first letter in all commits. Be verbose and precise in your commit messages.
Continue to name branches based on features that you are working on

  (evaluation scores)
  Functional Expectations
Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
CSS
Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Implementation
Novice Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
Conditional Logic
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Objects & Prototypes
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.
GIT & GITHUB
Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
GitHub
Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
PAIRING
Collaboration
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

  (feedback to me)
   Loved pairing with you, Megan! I’m glad we were able to openly communicate with each other about personal life and Turing life. Both of us having a design-eye made it fun to work on the styling details, and hopefully we can do a design project together soon! Thank you for owning and being a kickass partner when I was not at school on Monday! I know it’s scary to work on the JS alone at this point and you rocked it! I also appreciated that even though we were in high stress, we got along and helped keep each other stay calm and level-headed.As we both expressed, we both need to be better about capping the struggles and I was thinking next pair project we could both utilize a pom app to keep us accountable on taking breaks. Also, I feel like your stress level may decrease and confidence increase if you take more initiative to find a solution or reach out to a mod ahead of us or a mentor. You definitely did ask some, but I think if you asked earlier than the struggle may cap earlier.
Overall, I hope we get to pair again because we have too much fun! (yay Snooze brunch!) Happy Holidays! <3

  Our first pivit project was a success. We took ideabox and turnned it in to something called to2box. We refactored our code, changed the html/css to create our new project. We added new features as well.

  Hey Megan, I had a blast working with you. We got through all of our phases and Louisa(!) liked our project. I felt like our pairing went very smoothly and we spent the whole project celebrating progress and laughing at our mistakes. I really appreciated the lightheartedness that you brought to our pairing. It made working really easy. As far as feedback I would say just continue to practice switching branches when you push them to github. Hope to work with you again soon.Edgar


## D: Professional Skills

   I am very excited to continue the learning of professional devolopment skills. I feel like with my past experencie I will have a strong profile when I leave on every front. Each one is very helpful and different. Sometimes they seem like they are so much but they aren't so much when you actully do them. I am excited to use my strenghts more.

### Gear Ups

  The growth mindset gear up was something I didn't know I didn't have. I have always said I am a very open person. I just didn't know that I was holding myself back by not believing that anyone could do something with just hard work. I feel like I being more open to the growth now. 3

  The health and wellness gear up both made me feel more stressed which wasn't the point. I did use some of the advice she gave us to help my calm down. But having to wait two weeks before the next one wasn't good. I liked that we had a class on this but maybe back to back would be better. I need to use the self-care more in the next mod. I also need to give myself more prep talks to deal with the stress I feel so I actully feel it in the moment not a week later when my code can't pass the test. Maybe use the laugh more or set aside a time for me to laugh each day. 

  The gear up with mod 4 was very useful things to know and you should be doing them but you forget too. I was very chill and talked about struggle and how to get over your struggle. I knew a lot about it but I still needed to hear about it. I am definaly learning from the struggle here. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

  I love my experience here so far so I tell everyone about it. I have my cousin(she works in hr at a game company) looking at our grads. I tell my lyft or uber drivers and they ask me for cards. I love helping other people learn so I help as much as I can.
