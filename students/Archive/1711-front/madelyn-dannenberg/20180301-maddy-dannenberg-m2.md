## Areas of Emphasis

_What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?_
My learning focus this inning was algorithmic thinking. My technical goals were to improve in Javascript, practice testing and refactoring, and thoroughly understand array and object prototype methods. I wanted to become comfortable with asking questions, talking about code and reaching out to others with more experience when I needed help. I feel like I achieved these goals and I was happy with the amount of Javascript practice I got and how each project turned out this inning.

* **C: Professional Skills**: _3_
* **D: Community Participation**: _3_
* **E: Final Assessment**: _4_

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_
The individual projects this inning helped develop my algorithmic thinking by introducing and working with data structures (linked list and binary tree). The most challenging part of the projects was that coding algorithms required a much different process than the other projects/applications I had built in the first module. The individual projects forced us to ask peers for help and to talk about problems, and I hope to continue working with others and better communicating my processes and code in the next module. 

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_
My study habits changed from the previous inning because I spent more time working with practice problems and array and object prototypes, whereas in the first module I focused on reading lessons and preparing for instruction time. I spent time rereading notes from class in order to synthesize the lessons. These study habits serve me well and I plan to work on reading outside documentation next module.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your areas of emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
I enjoyed Sorting Suite because I understood each sorting method at a high level and liked the challenge of turning that into code. It was challenging working together with the whole class for the first time. The work flow felt much different than pair projects because it was more disorganized and harder to keep everyone on the same page. This serves my area of emphasis the project focused on algorithmic thinking and breaking down complex problems. It served my overall goals because I gained exposure to computer science principles that will help in my career as a software engineer.

### Complete Me
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** _4_
* **Testing:** _4_
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3_
* **Evaluator Comments:** _Very nice thorough testing of edge-cases, impressive that you had the foresight for catching most of those sad-path test cases._

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your areas of emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of Complete Me and turning the visual understanding of Tries into code. It was challenging working with the entire class because we had a lot of different ideas about how to tackle the problem and had to break into smaller groups. This project served my areas of emphasis by introducing another data structure and computer science principle. It served my overall goals because I gained practice coding with others with different working styles.

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_
Our two group projects were my favorite part about Mod2. I was able to work well with both my partners through strong communication and driver-navigator pairing. These projects helped with my areas of emphasis because both forced us to work with new JS frameworks, which was challenging but also a fun problem-solving practice. Next inning I plan to continue communicating openly with my partners and hope to become more comfortable with refactoring.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Aldo Mercado_
* **Game:** _Breakout_
* **Functional Expectations:** _3+_
* **User Interface:** _3+_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _3_
* **JS Style:** _3_
* **Workflow:** _3_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your areas of emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
Working with Canvas was very challenging because it was totally different than anything else we had worked on previously, but I did enjoy working with something so visual and seeing every change in code. This served my areas of emphasis because my partner was very good about seeing areas where we could refactor and challenging me to follow the "red, green, refactor" cycle for testing and refactoring. 


### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Matt Walker_
* **Pass/Fail:** _Pass_
* **Spec Adherence:** _TBD_
* **User Interface:** _TBD_
* **HTML Style:** _TBD_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _TBD_
* **JS/React Style:** _TBD_
* **Testing:** _TBD_
* **Workflow:** _TBD_
* **Code Sanitation:** _TBD_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your areas of emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_
I loved learning React.js and learning how to work with an API. It was challenging learning a new program as we dove into the project but my partner and I worked well together and understood how our components worked together. This served both my areas of emphasis and overall Turing goals by further "learning how to learn," building an app that fetches from an API and practicing utilizing array prototypes.  


## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _Agile development and leadership_
  * _Feedback II_
  * _Storytelling II_
  * _Outreach and Networking_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_
During the PD sessions this module I improved my skills of providing good feedback to project partners and using Agile processes. I think the most valuable thing I got out of this module's PD sessions was peer feedback on my story, which will be important in the interview process.

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _Code Debugging the Gender Gap_
  * _Tragedy of the Commons_
  * _Flavor of S*** sandwich_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_
I did find the gear up sessions this module very thought-provoking and important. While it is difficult to get rid of every human bias, becoming cognizant of biases that you do have is a very important step. I do feel like I have the tools to keep having these conversations.

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_
I contributed to the Turing community by organizing the pairing schedule and mythical creatures tutoring sessions for Mod1 and attending IronFE. I paired with several Mod 1 students. The experience was enjoyable because it allowed me to feel confident about what I learned in Mod 1, but was also challenging to jump into a new code base and be able to quickly identify problems. 

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_
Over break I plan to sharpen my React.js skills by practicing building comps from previous projects. Next inning I am looking forward to learning more about the best ways to test React, learning new frameworks and building more useful and complex applications. Over intermission week I plan to take time to recharge by spending time in the mountains and doing lots of chores so I can fully focus on school next mod.
