## Mod 4 Review

What was your biggest achievement of the module?
-Project-wise = Palette Picker. I had built a database for mod 3 personal project, so I had exposure and self-taught knowledge of Knex and Express, so I enjoyed getting the big picture of how these relate to Node and SQL as well as the right way to pull from the database and make responses.

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
-DATA in our capstone. We had to spend days just trying to get information from the database, then days figuring out how to get the data in a format we could use, then days struggling with Leaflet and seeding data.
-learned to keep plugging along, even if only small pieces of progress are made each day, these stepped amounted to a small visualization in the end.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
-worked with nrel to redesign website and build data visualization
-client management, learned how to interact with a client as they change their vision

How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
-solidified that I want to be a front-end dev, like the creativity, visual side
-glad i had exposure to backend to round out my skills 

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
-Coding
-Passion for coding because it is fun, social, creative and engaging

### 30-day post-grad job search action plan

#### Schedule and Goals: 
-[30-Day Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=MnI4cmVra3RtaDhkdm51ZnNjaWlhYzB1NWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
-Big goal: Receive an offer in the next 45 days
-Monthly goal: Have interviews
-Weekly goal: Practice interview questions/etiquette
-Daily goal: Send in one application or make one cold/warm outreach

#### Coding: 
-[Daily Practice Github](https://github.com/mmdberg/daily-practice)
-Exercisms
-JS Assessment
-Build new React project
-Resolve issues from past projects
-Read class notes
-Sorting Algorithms


#### Networking and Company Research 
-Plan to use LinkedIn and Meetup to find individuals/events to connect with, specifically Women Who Code and React meetup events. 
-I will attend the Cold Outreach sessions on Tuesday to learn how to track down and connect with individuals from companies I am interested in.
-I hope to talk to members of the community/Turing alumni about their experience in the tech industry, day-to-day work, tips for the job search.
-I will use jobtrack.io to keep track of jobs and interviews.

#### Interview Prep
-I would like to improve my white boarding skills, my ability to speak to the backend/databases, and technical interview skills. I will improve these by doing code challenges, setting up mock interviews and reading through class notes.

#### Housekeeping

-[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmdberg/)

#### Check-ins
-I will check in with Aldo and Sabrina and Jared. These are my fellow megadesk members and classmates I have had in-depth conversations about the job search with through Mod4. I will reach out to them over Slack and ask for updates to foster accountability.

#### Barriers
-My biggest barrier is the networking/outreach process since it is very new to me. I will overcome this by working with classmates and alumni to learn tricks and tips.
