# Maddy Dannenberg - /M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a solid understanding of React, Redux and Router. I wanted to build each project with clean code, practice test driven development and push myself to do extensions on each project. I also wanted to design and develop a personal project that was useful and focused.

Finish Your Fifty is an application for runners with the goal to run a race in every state. The app provides a way for these users to easily see which states have been completed and search races in states that have not yet been completed. The user can add races manually or using search results, and can see a race log with all race information.

The frontend was built with React, Redux and React Router and the backend was built with Express and Knex.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

In the microaggressions Gear Up we discussed where microaggressions come from and the difference between impact and intent. This gear up made me more cognizant of why microaggressions are difficult to interrupt, how microaggressions should be addressed, and when I am being microaggressive.

#### Groupthink

In the groupthink Gear Up we discussed the consequences of groupthink and in what situations it is most likely to occur. Discussing the ways that groupthink persists at Turing has made me more motivated to mitigate groupthink through diversity and awareness.

#### Tech in Medicine

I was in the Tech in Medicine group for the Mod 4-led Gear Up session. We learned about challenges in the medical industry related to tech and how the industry has potential to be disrupted with a new technology. This was an interesting discussion because much could be gained by switching medical treatment from 'intermitant and reactive' to 'continuous and proactive' and technology is likely a key to get there.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
