# Aldo Mercado Mod 4 Portfolio

### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
My biggest achievement of the module was being able to juggle all of the things we had going on and turning everything in. 


### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Trying to balance school work and at the same time looking for a job was a struggle for me. I decided to focus more on school and hit the job hunt hard as soon as I graduate. I learned that I like to take one thing at a time and stay focused. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
Challenged myself and picked a new framework for capstone. 


### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Finally getting to work with back-end technologies was exciting for me and it brought everything full circle. 

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Turing has taught me that I can learn anything. I have gained the skills to be able to figure things out and get the job done.
