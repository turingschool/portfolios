# Theresa Marquis - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Technically, my goal for the mod was to learn foundational javascript, html, and css. Professionally, my goal was to futher nurture and enrich my relationships with fellow students and instructors.  During the process, I wanted to manage conflicts with composure when possible and practice effective stress management techniques routinely.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed 1 project and 3 static compositions, named: Number Guesser, Static Comp 1, Static Comp 2, and Static Comp 3

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description - Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/tm-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

* Description: Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css (no JavaScript); source assets independently, result must be responsive across a range of screen sizes.

* Evaluation comments: improve icon aspect ratio, be mindful of color calibrations; investigate full background images in css and crop images differently for different media queries; use 72-96 dpi resolutions for png and jpg, font sizes should be suitable for screen size; avoid explosive changes between media queries; use viewport metatag 

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/tm-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This was an extension of the first static comp, for further practice and skills expansion.  Learning emphasis is on: how a user can best experience the layout across various screen sizes; legible content; images should look good.

- Pay closer attention to color palette
- Reasonable adherence to Gestalt priciple of Proximity.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/tm-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

General description is that this is a tough layout to build that will take several days.  Media queries hold particular challenges and should receive attention in planning before coding.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Three projects this mod were paired projects.  My primary goal for all of the projects was be a good partner to my partner.  So I concentrated on the DTR and listening to my partner.  I learned a lot about the disparity in styles between

#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project is a bookmarking application for websites. Users can create bookmarks with a title and a link, and delete them. They are not stored. This was a paired project with Edgar Munoz. The project is written with vanilla JS.

Improve:
- Error messaging - more direct instructions for avoiding the error
- Knock the red down on your clear read buttons, fix spacing between inputs
- Hard to read the read bookmarks text on the screen
- Use the HTML style conventions.
- Add labels to inputs.
- Use ems or rms for fonts
- Use box-sizing: border-box
- Avoid IDs as CSS selectors
- Need better names for JS objects
- Be descriptive in gitHub comments

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This is a simple application for recording and archiving ideas.  The ideas are able to be persisted in local storage, edited in the window with changes persisted as well.  JavaScript (with jQuery) manages client-side interactions.
JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.

The work captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp.

#### ToDoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project uses IdeaBox code from a fellow student as the base.  This project refactors the base to have little to no duplication in JavaScript (DRY principle), no deep nesting (for if/else conditionals), and to keep line lengths short and readable to avoid horizontal scrolling in sublime.

## D: Professional Skills
I appreciated the focus on the social media and networking apps.  Cold outreach is a technique that I will implement.  I updated my LinkedIn successfully. 

### Gear Up
#### Be Your Own Ally

* [GitHub URL](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-purpose/201307/speak-yourself)

It was useful to learn of the "empathetic/commpassionate self-interest" approach to managing the potential conflict that arises between the needs of others and personal needs.  We discussed the ways that self-interests can be tended while maintaining an attitude that is mindful of the needs of others. For most of us in attendance, keeping our own interests as a priority is our challenge but the session helped us with specific strategies, such as taking conversations to resolve conflict to a dedicated time/space, rather than in the urgency of the moment. 

#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL]()

How to recode inner scripts is a great skill to develop.  For example: "I did something wrong," can be rescripted as "I learned (can learn) from it." Also of specific benefit is the rescript, "I am terrible." into "I am fine as I am."

#### Health and Wellness (2)

* [GitHub URL]()

The conversation about mindfulness benefits was very powerful.  Techniques I implement, as a result of the information include the deep breathing and walking to school as a mindfulness practice.  The facilitator reminded us that a wise mind is both emotional and reasonable.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I provided a self-care container with gum, coupons to lunch restaurants, lotion, a pillow, and a blanket.  I was encouraging to classmates and
