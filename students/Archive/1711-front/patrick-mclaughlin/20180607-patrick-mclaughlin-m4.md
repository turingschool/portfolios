# Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest Achievement

I would have to say that my biggest achievement in Mod 4 was taking second place at Demo Competititon. I already had an app I was very proud of, so making it to the finals was a great honor already. I did not think that I would place in it, but was incredibly humbled to finish in second. I believe I was able to do well because I took a risk by attempting to create a backend for my project, as it wasn't something I had experience with at this point. 

Diving into the docs to implement that piece of technology in my project was a great experience. It really set the stage for my remaining time at Turing. It gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to tackle something new by just reading documentation. I feel like this will be a great asset for me during my career as a developer. 

## Biggest struggle

The juggling act of Mod 4 was probably my biggest challenge. Doing all of the projects, keeping up with lessons that did not necessarily build off one another, and all of the work that goes into the job hunt was a big challenge. Unfortunately, the job hunt was probably what suffered the most, it is hard for me to not put full effort into a project. I was still able to get one offer before the end of the program, but I do have some regrets about not having more. I am excited by the opportunity to put in a full 100% into the job hunt starting next week. 

## What sets me apart? 

I would say the number one thing that sets me apart from my peers is my contribution to helping other cohorts at Turing. I was able to get Iron FE back on track, after it nearly stopped altogether last inning. Their was great participation from Mod 3 students leading sessions, which was great to see because getting sessions together to teach them last inning wasn't the most reliable thing to count on. 1803 also had a very strong presence at Iron FE sessions, and I feel confident the group is in good hands.

I also spend a lot of time pairing with 1801 and 1803 for various projects over the course of the inning. I really enjoyed working with game time projects again, and keeping my React skills sharp by pairing with Mod 3 on their various projects. 

## Full stack experience

Mod 4 gave me a pretty good idea of the flow of a website from server to client. Prior to writing my own backend, that part of the process was largely a mystery to me, and possibly done with some sort of magic. Prior to Mod 4, I felt that I was going to stick to the front end during the course of my career. Now, I feel like I can dive into back end technologies, I just have to be willing to put in the work and time necessary to produce quality code. 

## Skillset

Thinking about the skillset Turing gave me, I really was not sure how to answer at first. I didn't really get the ability to learn here, nor the ability to work hard. I had those things already. I would have to say my biggest takeaway from my time at Turing is probably to believe in my own abilities, and that if I really want something, that I am able to put in a tremendous amount of effort to go and get it. Prior to coming to Turing, I had incredible doubts about my ability to succeed here. I knew I was smart, and I knew that I can put in hard work. I just had doubts in my ability to deliver in an environment in which I had no background experience in. So, now I leave here knowing that I can tackle any problem I run into, I have the abilities to take it head on and deliver.

From a more technical stand point, I do feel like Turing gave me the tools to be a valuable contributor to any develop team I am a part of. I am cognizant of how I should engage with fellow teammembers, and to write code with developer empathy.
