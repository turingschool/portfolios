## Module 4 (Front-end)
# Steven Lee Lawson
## Areas of Emphasis
 My goal for this mod was learn how to build backends using Node/Express/Knex while augmenting my knowledge of different technologies used in the industry.

# Required Projects

### StaffGigBox
For the Capstone project, Jared Eklin and I decided to build an event scheduler that solved the problem of scheduling many employees at many events.

Tech stack:
* React
* Node/Express
* Enzyme/Jest
* Mocha/Chai
* Firebase Auth
* Travis CI
* Heroku
* Surge

### House of Vars
We made a contribution to the Australian-based Open Food Network, which was largely in Ruby. We selected a small issue, and our pull request was accepted!

### Palette Picker
Palette Picker was our first project of the mod, where we put our new-found Node/Express knowledge to use, with a server-side render of the front end with good ol jQuery.

### BYOB
Sabrina and I used Nightmare to web-scrape Wikipedia tables to make a back end where we had all of the state parks for every state.


# Professional Development
I accepted a job in Ruston, Louisiana at Riverstone Software.

# Community
At Turing, I was proud to represent my cohort as an SAB rep for modules 1 and 2, where I helped communication between students and staff, as well as plan events for the Turing community. My retro-pie was a big hit at the winter social!

The gear-up I helped lead was actually the idea I submitted the last day of mod 3: 'Winning Through Failure.' I really enjoyed leading this group because the topic is pretty much my story at this point. I got to tell about my own failures to break the ice, and I think we fostered a really good discussion about life, and how sometimes the only way forward is through.

### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I'd say graduating with a job! Being an anxious fellow, I worried constantly about month after month going by after graduation, not being able to find a job; which I think was trauma from my experience after I graduated from Galvanize. When I was completing the code challenge that was part of the interview process, I had this beautiful moment where I was synthesizing all the concepts and skills I had learned during my seven months here.
I still can't quite believe I did it, and even though I still have varying degrees of imposter syndrome, I am excited to begin this new chapter in the Life of Lawson.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Mod 2 was the most challenging for me during my Turing journey, which is most likely by design as a crucible. When I paired with Wats, I really learned how to talk about code using the right terminology, as well as to truly see what was happening in every line of the sorting algorithm. I spent hours with class mates going over every part of sorting suite to make sure I understood what was happening, just like I did with Wats.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Coming from an artistic background, I always assumed I needed to live in the front end, because I need to see what was on the page, with a decent UI and typography. I learned that I actually really enjoy working in the back end, which honestly surprised me a bit. There is more convention with an established way of doing things that I really liked.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Thinking programmatically, which is to say how to break down a much larger problems, is a skill I am finally starting to implement on a daily basis. Turing was easily the hardest thing I have ever done, so there is also the comforting knowledge that if I can graduate from Turing, there is nothing I cannot learn or accomplish. That being said, I know there is still much for me to learn, and many areas of coding on which I could improve.
