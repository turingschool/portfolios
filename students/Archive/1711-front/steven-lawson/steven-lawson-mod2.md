# Steven Lee Lawson - M2 Portfolio
### Areas of Emphasis
#### What was your learning focus this inning? What technical and communication skills did you want to grow? Do you feel like you've achieved those goals?
My learning focus was to understand OOP better through an es6 lens, as well as to better understand programming by learning computer science fundamentals by building sorting algorithms and prefix trees.

#### Self-Evaluation

A: Individual Work & Projects: 3
B: Group Work & Projects: 3
C: Professional Skills: 4
D: Community Participation: 3
E: Final Assessment: TBD

#### Individual Work & Projects
##### Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?

Really understanding what the computer was doing "under the code" for Sorting Suite was particularly challenging; pairing with Wats really helped me see what was happening at each iteration, and destructured the Lawson brain in a very good way.

#### Study Habits
##### What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?

Showing up at 8 AM almost every day to attend Iron FE was a very good thing for me to do, and I think really helped me set the foundations for understanding array prototype methods as well as strengthening my interview skills for technical problems.

#### Sorting Suite
#### Outcome: Pass
##### What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

In hindsight, it was really fascinating to build sorting algorithms from scratch, though at the time it was a bit painful, though I had the whole class to help me through it. It was a unique experience this mod because it truly was a collective effort, and was very different from the paired experiences of working on Weathrly and Game-Time. It served my goals for Turing and beyond by making me a tougher, more competent dev.

#### Complete Me
Fundamental JS and Style: 3
Testing: 3
Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Functional Expectations: 3
Code Sanitation: 3
##### What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

My favorite thing about Complete Me was implementing it (after some confusion) in Weathrly and seeing it work! After populating with the list of city/states and SEEING the suggestions before my own very eyes in the browser filled me with a sense of accomplishment. Complete Me upped-the-ante on Sorting Suite, and will give me context of what is happening under the hood for any future packages (I won't have to build) that I use in a project.

#### Group Work & Projects
Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?

#### GameTime
Partner: Emily Kuckleman
Game: Missile Command
Functional Expectations: 3
User Interface: 3
Testing/Code Sanitation: Soft 3
JS Style: 3
Workflow: 3
##### What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

GameTime was very stressful, but when I was done, I think I had a much better understanding of OOP and how to pass data from class to class became much more clear. In addition, I became more comfortable with es6 in general. At the end, I had a working game, which I enjoyed. It also gave me a lot of respect for the games I grew up playing with as a kid, now knowing what all went into them.
#### Weathrly
Partner: Ngoc Phan

PASS

##### What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?

Weathrly has been my favorite project so far at Turing, which is a good thing, because I understand this simulates much of the work we will be doing 'out in the wild' as front end developers in the real world. The most challenging parts of it were learning the react syntax (and trying to test react), but after completing this project, I am very excited to do more in react in module 3.

##### C: Professional Skills
#### PD Sessions:
Agile practices and leadership
Feedback II
Outreach and Networking

#### What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?
I learned that Agile is a much understood concept, as Agile is a huge buzzword in the industry, but more often then not, agile and waterfall are combined to varying degrees. With feedback, I learned that there are many verbal cues that can incorrectly display intent that one needs to be aware of, and that outreach and networking can begin at Turing by utilizing the community.

#### Gear Up Sessions:
Debugging the Gender Gap
Parable of the Polygons
Mod4 led: How to Avoid Burnout

##### What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?

What was most surprising was how often people can say they are all about diversity in the workplace, but often harbor unknown biases, even to themselves. Talking about this disparity and being aware of it, is the first step to changing the unbalance in the tech world, whether it is an unbalance in gender or in race. By starting the conversation, I am much more aware of it, and would feel much more compfortable talking about it in the future.

#### Community Participation
##### Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?
I was a proud member of the SAB for my second term, and enjoyed being the liason between the students and the staff. I paired with Watts, which was very illuminating, and pairing with students in module 1 showed me how far I have come, while helping someone who was in place not all that long ago.

#### Final Assessment
##### What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?
I plan to continue strengthening my versatility with array prototypes over break, and I will continue to go to Iron FE in the next mod to share what I have learned, while further bolstering my own understanding. In addition, I plan to continue learning React through tutorials to prepare me for module 3.

#### Outcome:
