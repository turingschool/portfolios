# Steven Lawson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main objective was to really make sure that my JavaScript foundations were in place for me to become a competent front end developer. This took the form of 'chopping vegetables' in doing mythical creatures twice, and taking very thorough notes. Though I still have much to learn, I am confident I have become proficient in the art and language of JS, with regards to module 1.

## A: End of Module Assessment

TBD


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In the last module, we had one individual and three paired projects that tested our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, there were three static comps to work on our HTML and CSS muscle.

#### Number Guesser
##### Evaluator: Pam
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/StevensIncredibleNumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our first project in Module one. After a week of basic introductions to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we were tasked with building a simple app that had a user enter a number that was then compared to a generated random number.

#### DESIGN
Majority of comp recreation aligns with provided comp
Be mindful of all details when recreating comp - spacing, sizing, etc.

#### HTML
Nice work with ARIA - semantic elements, forms, labels, inputs
Work on syntax in HTML- no spacing between lines and watch indentation

#### CSS
Be sure to take advantage of cascading styles to avoid redundancy
Reference Idiomatic CSS style guide for formatting and organization

#### JS
-Good start with breaking functionality apart

-Refactoring opportunities in JS: some redundancy, unclear why you are pulling same value from input in multiple areas

-Work on function naming in JS - can be hard to follow at times

##### Functional Expectations
-Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
-Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

#### Static Comp One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/static-comp-one)
* [GitHub Pages](https://stevenleelawson.github.io/static-comp-one/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette. I had fun with a batman/joker theme.

#### Evaluation comments

-Got a bit 'squirrely' on mobile
-Make sure you are testing it on multiple devices in dev tools. ESPECIALLY the iPhone five.

#### Static Comp Two

* [GitHub Pages](https://stevenleelawson.github.io/sl-comp-challenge-two/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For our second static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette. Musical instruments with a dark theme was my creative twist on the content.

#### Evaluation comments

-Overall: Good Job!
-Don't forget about hover states that are implied in the comp.
-Tighten up text/icon units
-Not a lot of contrast with dark blue and some elements (eg VIEW 02)
-Good grouping!

#### Static Comp Three
##### Evaluator: Pam
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/sl-static-comp-three)
* [GitHub Pages](https://stevenleelawson.github.io/sl-static-comp-three/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

For our third static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette. Musical instruments with a dark theme was my creative twist on the content.

#### Evaluation comments

#### UI

-NO SPAZZING on vertical nav with hover states
-In job descript, awkward white space at bottom
-buttons look okay, but lining up the inputs
-aside: centering the li's a bit awkward
-Hide dark blue in a hamburger
-Same with the other tab menu
PRO-TIP: Try Percents!! Accessibility 62.5===10%
LOOK UP IDIOMATIC CSS!!!!
-SEND ARIA WITH SCREENREADER

TO FIX:
- NO NUMBERS FALLING OUT OF DONUT CHARTS
- FIX LAST CHILD section
- FIX SPACING AT THE END OF JOB DESCRIPTION CHART
- HIDE INTO HAMBURGER BUN: MAKE DARK BLUE MENU HIDE THE SECTIONS

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of the last 6 weeks, we had a total of 3 paired projects. All of the projects tested our HTML and CSS abilities, as well as building on our JavaScript and jQuery abilities week by week. I did Linked Lists with Jon Sweet, IdeaBox with Edgar Munoz, and 2DoBox-Pivot with Mike Duke.

#### Linked List
##### Evaluator: David
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stevenleelawson/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first project with jQuery. We had to build out an app that had two input fields, where a user could add in the title and URL of a bookmark. The created bookmarks were then appended to a created bookmark section of the page. In this project, we first learned about event bubbling and manipulating the DOM using jQuery.

#### Evaluation Comments
- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

#### Evaluation Scores

##### Functional Expectations
##### Evaluator: David
##### Notes/What To Work On:
#####comp
-The linked list title should not wrap at any breakpoint
-nice job having the two columns of cards
##### html
would probably move the p tags out of the form
##### css
Consider adding comments for different sections of your css
Use convention for organization within blocks - ie. idiomatic or alphabetized
Move media queries to bottom of file
When I see negative values for margins, that tells me I can probably add margin to another element and achieve the same result

##### js
Consider using template literals to simplify appending things to the dom
Break out similar blocks of code into their own functions and pass dynamic pieces as arguments
git/github
Love all those commits
Say more in each commit - as much as you can in 30 seconds or so.

##### Functional Expectations
Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

#### Feedback from Jon
Dearest Steven,
I thoroughly enjoyed working with you on our Linked-List project. I feel that we did a great job capping the struggle (“smoke about it?“) and exploring what it means to have a clean github workflow. Taking the time to walk away from a challenge or do some ‘rubber-ducking’ worked very well for each of us. A consideration as it pertains to the challenges of DOM manipulation would be to draw out the DOM tree to give ourselves a nice visual of where we need to travel to access specific elements. I appreciate your eagerness to ask questions every step of the way and your patience in dealing with some of my winding suggestions or thoughts.
Sincerely,
Jon

### IdeaBox
##### Evaluator: David

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

With IdeaBox, we were first introduced to JSON and localStorage. We had to create an app that created new ideas that persisted when we reloaded the page.

#### Evaluation Comments -- Evaluated by David
##### Notes/What To Work On:
I don't think that I expressed this clearly enough during the eval, but I'm very dissapointed with how this project went. I expected better from both of you.
Going forward I think it would be better to have less functionality, and tighter code throughout than to have more functionality and sloppy code/implementation.
This project seemed like there was a huge lack of effort and organization. Be intentional with the code you write and follow the spec to a T.
##### comp
Pay attention to the details! Spacing and proportions were off, I'd expect ideas to be added to the top of the list instead of the bottom. It felt like a lot of decisions were made purely on laziness.
##### html
label you input fields!!!(whether that be label elements or aria-labels)
css
consider organizational comments and using bem
pick a convention for organization within rules and a way for organizing the rules themselves. Any convention.
##### js
pull duplicate blocks into functions and pass whatever is dynamic as an argument
good naming convention for your constructor function
use more action like names for functions - ie. modifyBody not modifiedBody
git/github
get into habit of writing as much as you can within a commit message in 30 seconds or so. Verbosity is key!
Functional Expectations
Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

##### HTML
Accessibility
Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

##### Style
Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
##### CSS
###### Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

##### Implementation
Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

##### JAVASCRIPT
###### Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

###### Conditional Logic
Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

###### Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

###### Arrays
Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
Proficient Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

###### Objects & Prototypes
Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
Proficient Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

##### DOM Manipulation
Advanced Beginner Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### GIT & GITHUB
###### Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.

##### Github
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN
###### Comp Recreation
Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING
###### Collaboration
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

#### Feedback from Edgar
Our method of working was unique in its approach than I had taken before. It was more touch and go and then comeback than it was pairing together all of the time, which I actually appreciated. I felt like we were both able to work parallel and learn what we need to understand. It wasn’t necessarily the most time saving working method but it was one that I valued nonetheless.
   I would say maybe work on breaking problems down so the task of the project doesn’t become overwhelming. I understand that as a beginner the idea of this big project seems daunting but just focus on writing one thing down at a time. We were able to sporadically implement Github issues. So I would say start with breaking down issues. Make sure your commit messages are specific to what you are committing and descriptive. I like your approach to learning and the fact that you are still working on understanding the project after evals. Good luck with your learning.

#### 2DoBox
##### Evaluator: Louisa
   For 2DoBox, we were given another group's IdeaBox from the week prior, and we were told to refactor it and add in new features. This was an interesting exercise so that we could learn how to read other people's code and it was also a good exercise in learning how to DRY-up code. We also got more practice with localStorage and jQuery.

#### Evaluation Comments
###### Overall
would like to see css and UI a little tighter, but clear we put a lot of thought and time into the JS More progress in general, think about big picture and not just tunnel vision on the JS; where we focused energy and time GOOD JOB!

###### UI
-no real need for overflow scroll for cards...let the window do it -cards visable behind filter bar -fix these squirrely things in the UI

###### HTML
-put a class on the span tag so it's more explicit

###### css
-margin:auto on universal selector: bandaids over whole body -text align:center is hacky -better to use flexbox or setting a % of a container with margin:saveButton -never use inline, use inline-block -up-vote: good place to refactor some CSS -shared class for upvote/down, then a more specific class for differences -no camelCase in CSS! -watch for opening and closing curlies on media query, and indentation inside of it

###### JS
Evident that we put most of our focus into JS for this project: refactors evident, and functionality good, but Louisa would have like to seen a bit more progress. Also, don't sacrifice UI for JavaScript!!!

###### Feedback from Mike:
I really enjoyed working with you. It was a great learning experience and I think we worked well together overall. I very much appreciated your point of view and i was very glad that we ended up being on the same page about so much of what we were doing. Going forward, make sure that you are taking care of yourself as much as you are trying to take care of your code. I think it might be helpful for you to set a Pomodoro timer for an interval that makes sense to you, and when it goes off, make sure you take those breaks. Know yourself and know when it's time to step away for a few minutes for your own sanity.

Thanks again for your help and your insight on this project--i could not have gotten through it without you. Keep up the good work

### Gear Up
#### Stress Management
##### Sessions One and Two

I think that it is really great that Turing actually CARES about our health and wellness, while "drinking from the fire-hose." The psychologist they brought in had a lot of good points about the nature of stress (eustress and distress). I learned that it is really important at my time at Turing (and beyond) to find small ways to take care of myself, whether that is micro-meditations in the morning or taking in the virescence of plants.


#### Strengths Finder

I really enjoyed the Strengths Finder assessment, as my introspective nature is constantly curious to different aspects of myself. My five core strengths are: Context, Empathy, Learner, Intellection, and Connectedness.

I really can see Context as I learn at Turing; if I can't see the bigger picture and the context of something specific that I am learning, I have a hard time locating where I am in my "mind palace." Practically, I have heard several times now from instructors that I need to "break things down into smaller pieces." It's interesting to me how some of my strengths can be both a strength AND a weakness.

##### Introvert or Extrovert?

It was interesting when Ellen Mary had us line up as a spectrum from either side of Clarke hall from introvert to extrovert: I found myself at the far side of the introvert spectrum, which would surprise some people because they usually assume I am an extrovert. I learned what really defines an introvert is not how shy or outgoing they are, but rather if one is recharged by social activity or alone time. I am definitely recharged by alone time, which brings up another interesting point: introverts are more sensitive to external stimuli, which is why you will often see me with headphones at Turing.

##### Module 4-led-Gear-up: DRAW THE OWL

Based on the philosophy of Turing or which the instructors show you how to draw two simplistic circles and then tell you to "draw the rest of the f**king owl," this student-led gear up focused on the idea of learning from your failures, instead of letting them be an albatross upon you. Specifically, what I really took from this gear up was how to spin my personal failure of needing more instruction on JavaScript as a positive in interviews utilizing the STAR method.

## E: Community Participation


### Playing a Part
At Turing I was happy to represent my class as a member of the SAB where I helped plan community events, lead class retros, and did my best to remind my class who's cleaning day it was. I received a lot of help from the community this mod, and I look forward to paying it forward to others in the future.
