What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Finally getting beyond my fixed mindset surrounding the back-end tech stack. Gaining a foundational understanding of the dom and html requests from all sides of the client/server interaction. Recognizing how many doors to creativity can open up as a result of understanding back-end technologies. I really do feel as though there's no longer any web technologies that are innacessible to me. Given enought time and effort, I feel truly confident that I could pick up almost any coding language or philosophy. 

What provided you with the most struggle? 
I had a fixed mindset about the backend.  It made me want to disengage from content that ended up being more interesting than I had assumed. Dealing with that, while also managing the pull between finding a job and networking vs focusing on the lessons and the projects. 


What did you learn from that struggle?  
That I need to be more confident when I'm stepping outside of my comfort zone. Servers and API endpoints as well as databases are not magical creatures that are inaccessible for me. It's clear how important it is to be able to speak about back-end systems and their interactions with the front-end. Having this knowledge gives me a solid head start over most junior devs. 

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
Embracing my outgoingness. Being willing and able to walk up to and strike up a conversation with complete strangers is something I never really considered a skill. It's clear that doing so is much more difficult for my peers than it is for me. Also, embracing my ability to speak in front of a crowd is new thing for me. I think I'll be able to use that to my advantage when speaking with clients or giving a pitch. I think it's a powerful skill that can be leveraged to great success in this industry. 


How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
It made me realize that I can spin up a project from start to finish in a substantially shortened amount of time. I had almost decided to not attend mod 4 becuase I didn't believe this was a tech stack that I would be willing to work in.  I believed that backend technologies would remain an area that I wouldn't be willing to venture.  This module, however light it may have been, has opened my eyes to how I can bring much more value and usefulness to any project that I create.   

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

JUST START! Don't wait for your inner monologue to give approval. Don't wait for someone elses validation of an idea. Just start. Don't hit the pause button on an idea because you think there will be some road blocks. Just start working. Start coding. Deal with the problems as they come up. Have the confidence that you'll get through those problems. Usually, the unforseen problems are not as big a deal as you think they will be. They're actually just excuses to not get started! 

Turing has pushed me beyond what I used to be willing to do. This has forced me to understand there's a limit
to my cognitive resources and that I need to be much more cognizant of where I'm applying those resources. My understanding of software development can in fact carry over beyond just the front end. I don't have to be afraid or have any fixed mindsets with anything related to code. Maybe most importantly, Turing has helped me understand that signs of when I'm falling into a fixed mindset. 

In general Turing has been one of the most tranformative experiences of my life. This place is so much more than just a coding school. The mission of Turing is inspiring. The instructors are inspiring. My fellow classmates are inspiring. The struggle here is real and worth it. I had been depressed for a few years leading up to my enrollment here. I sold a house, along with almost all of my posessions and then welcomed a child into the world. But I hadn't turned the spotlight on myself yet. I hadn't addressed what direction I was going to go. I made a gamble coming to Turing and I got so much more out of this place than I could have imagnined. Last night while discussing this experience, my SO shared with me a text I had sent her while I was in the middle of a code challenge in mod 3. I had forgotten I sent it, but she saved it for me. I think it speaks to the power of the process at work here and how transformative it really is.

From jan 25th
Just had an odd moment that was sort of the opposite of the panic attacks I used to deal with. I'm sitting in a study room, working on this challenge test they gave us, kind of stressing about it. Then I realized how much fun this actually is! How happy I am too have you and baby girl waiting at home. My life is filled with love and challenge and expectation of the future. It's an amazing feeling that I haven't had for a long time. It's stressful but it's good stress. Love you. ❤️ That dark cloud is lifting, I think."
