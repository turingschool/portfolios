# Hugh Morrison - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this mod, I put a massive amount of effort into solidifying my skills. I also spent a great deal of time with the IRON-FE study group as well as the Wednesday morning meditation group. I made it a goal to be as accessible as possible to mod2 FE students as well as to backend students that needed the occasional CSS help. What a fantastic mod.

* PASSING

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on a host of projects individually. Here, I will showcase my very cool projects.

### AGRRO SURF - PERSONAL PROJECT

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/aggro-surf)

* This was my mod-3 personal project. It just so happened that I had planned a trip to Southern California to job search and surf in between mods. I'm a big surfer and surf forecasting sites are notoriously inaccurate and so I wanted to make my own.
* I set out to build a data visualization heavy app that would pull in surf forecast data from various sources and consequently visualize that data in a meaningful way.
* This was a super challenging project. I think I ended up hitting 25 end points and so formatting all the incoming data and visualizing it all was quite difficult.
* I used FireBase as a backend and ran into some difficulty learning how to use their o Auth system. Also, testing this project was complicated.
* This project utilizes webpack, react, react router, redux, firebase, ES6, and chart.js.

### SWAPI BOX

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/SWAPI-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI box was an ultra cool project in which we were tasked with hitting various endpoints and displaying the star wars related data that was returned in a meaningful way. It had CRUD functionality and was served with a very chic UI

#### Evaluation Scores

##### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application completes all 3 iterations.

##### Code Quality

* 3: Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design

* 3: Some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing

* 3: Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built some pretty cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase Headcount, and MovieTracker.

### HEADCOUNT

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* [DTR memo ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgUohIUnk46gJxbOY-YA0_FzqEKRxGn1NV2ZtAdX3BI/edit)

#### Evaluation Scores

##### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

##### Code Quality

* 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

##### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

##### Testing

* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### Feedback from Charlie:

Your artisanal and chic approach to development is refreshing. No, but seriously you're super easy to work with. It's nice how you're able to both pair and work independently with ease. Keep doing your thing.

### MOVIETRACKER

MOVIETRACKER is a super neat movie app that allows the user to sign in and save their favorite movies. MOVIETRACKER was meant to mimic netflix's UI and is overall very chic.


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/MovieTracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [DTR MEMO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQ07Ym2Oz3bn5S_Oh6PU1FzuWurt2x1c1oLO0f_4Q3U/edit)


#### Evaluation Scores

##### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

##### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

##### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### Feedback from Tim:

Your biggest strength that I saw during MovieTracker was your ability to research and figure out complex challenges, i.e. configuring our testing suite to run with webpack, configuring redux, all the login functionality. I appreciate how you are able to solve the problem, then circle back find other creative and more efficient ways to refactor. Constructive feedback, I think you could work on talking through your thought process when working with a group. Overall, great experience!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member

#### AUTOMATION

* [WorkShop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/five_noah_eric_nicke_laszlo.md)

Automation is a very complicated topic to discuss and I'm glad we had this gear up in order to navigate it's nuances. Some people predict that it will be the end of days, but it doesn't have to be. We must contemplate what will happen when we create life forms with autonomy and super intelligence. Would their morality, their system of ethics, evolve in a way that is in line with our interests? This is an important topic to consider.

As a result of automation, many jobs in our modern economy will be rendered obsolete. We must consider what we can do so that financially vulnerable people aren't crushed by this inevitable transition.

We're beginning to quite literally bring machines into existence that are able to augment, and theoretically, replace our brains. Machines can compute and make decisions. The implications of this will surely be ultra profound.

### Giving Feedback

To Charlie: HeadCount

* Working with Charlie was an absolute breeze. I think headcount was hugely successful, in large part to Charlie's tenacity and open communication. He showed tremendous grit and resilience in the face of uncertainty and new technologies. His styling efforts in this project were huge and our very chic UI comes as a result of his long hours and hard work. It was a pleasure working with Charlie and I look forward to doing so again soon.

To Pam: MovieTracker

* Working with Pam was an absolute breeze. She is tenacious and gritty in the face of uncertain odds and is comfortable tackling complex nuanced problems using innovative approaches . She is chilled out and wonderful to collaborate with. I look forward to working with her in the future.

### Playing a Part

This mod, I've really immersed myself in the Turing community. I continued my involvement with the Verou posse and gained valuable insight into design and data visualization. I continued my involvement with iron-fe, and met most mornings to tackle complex javaScript problems. I also met with a meditation group every Wednesday and practiced for thirty minutes. I tried to put myself out there as much as possible and I feel as though it really paid off. What a great mod.
