## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built some pretty cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase 2Do-Box-Pivot and Weathrly.

### 2Do-Box-Pivot

2Do-Box-Pivot is an evolved linked list. We added several features to our mod-1 linked lists,
and we refactored using es6, we tested heavil yusing selenium webdriver, and we made sure it was accessible to all.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/2-do-box)

#### Feedback from Marissa:

Hugh was a great partner. He was always willing to go through anything he coded while we were coding separately. The thing that could have made the pairing more beneficial for both and efficient I think could have been grabbing a computer and letting one drive while we both could have gone through logically what needed to happen.

### Weathrly

Weathrly is a super neat weather app that utilizes React.js and Wunderground's API to bring you the most up to date weather in a very pleasant and chic UI.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/Weathrly)

#### Feedback from Franklin:

Hugh is a great team member. His hard work and dedication helped drive our project to completion.

Strengths:
Detailed:
Hugh is very detail oriented. He is not one to leave a stone unturned

Knowledgeable:
Hugh is great at debugging and often has multiple approaches to solve a problem.

Debugging:
it was great seeing Hugh’s approach. I learned many new methods from him.


Growth:
There were times when Hugh would go off on his own and not talk through his process. While we were pair programming it was difficult to assist as it was easy to lose track of the direction. I would recommend slowing down a little and talking though the issue.


I look forward to working with Hugh again in the future.


### Professional Development

#### Thoughts on Project Management

This mod, we had two major paired projects. Franklin and I tried to keep our development as agile and communicative as possible, using frequent checkins and delegation of responsibility. We tried to respond to problems as they arose in a manner that was fluid and organic. This project went really well because of the strategies we implemented. Strategies that we learned from the professional development classes. Bravo.

#### Thoughts on FeedBack

Marissa and Franklin both gave me tremendously valuable feedback. I heard from Franklin that I had a tendency to get lost in my own head when tackling complex problems. I admit that this is a tactic I generally employ. I can now see that it would be more beneficial for me if I were to speak openly about the problem faced and consequently ask for help.

#### Flower Power Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)

* [Gist URL](https://gist.github.com/hmorri32/82e0ed35c3d5dc4a2d1032e3415e64a7)

#### Plan to Reach Out to Mentor

I know some great developers at several companies in Miami, Denver, Boulder, and San Francisco. I plan to reach out to them, one by one, in order to pick their brains. I can only imagine the wealth of information they all have. I've built several relationships with developers in the Denver area. I've done this by attending meetups at galvanize and at wework and by being generally outgoing while at bars. I've met fabulous people that work at Stack Overflow and heaps of other cool companies while out enjoying a frosty beer.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member

#### Gear Up Notes - Tragedy Of The Commons

* [WorkShop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

If each hypothetical tech exec were to subconsciously hold the biases displayed in this gear up , then, using the parable of the polygons as an example, we will see how small, personal biases alter the structure of the “society”. Available jobs will only go to those people who are similar to the person in charge of hiring. Or rather, jobs will go to those who are similar to the team.

POTP had an example that illustrated how not holding bias in a systemically biased surrounding is problematic for the larger society. This was an interesting take on an idea that is hard to explain. So, given this dynamic, I do think potp illustrates how these measures may add some value to the larger system.

Potp's goal seems to illustrate how "harmless choices can make a harmful world." The game illustrated that point perfectly through their interactive, illustrative, and engaging UI. The bias sliders were tremendously helpful for visualizing the systemic effects of personal bias.

#### Universal Basic Income

Lots of jobs in our modern economy simply don't pay a livable wave. and even those that do may be rendered obsolete by new technologies and automation. We must consider what we can do so that financially vulnerable people aren't crushed by this inevitable transition. We must take the time to consider something that economists have proposed, theoretically, for ages, UBI.

Were not beginning to have machines that are able to augment and automate our brains and thus replace mental tasks. Machines can compute and make decisions. The implications of this will surely be as profound as what the industrial revolution did for our bodies and labor heavy tasks.

### Giving Feedback

To Marissa: 2Do-Box-Pivot

* I really enjoyed my time working with Marissa. She is a tenacious problem solver with heaps of grit. She is a great communicator and is open to exploring novel approaches to problem solving. She is very chilled out and wonderful to collaborate with. I look forward to working with her in the future.

To Franklin: Weathrly

* Working with Franklin was a breeze. I think this project was hugely successful, in large part to Franklins tenacity and open communication. He showed tremendous grit and resilience in the face of uncertainty and new technologies. His styling efforts in this project were huge and our very chic UI comes as a result of Franklin's long hours and hard work. It was a pleasure working with Franklin and I look forward to doing so again soon.

To Chris Jordan, mod 1: Pairing

* Chris seemed to have a solid grasp on the concepts taught in Mod 1. While pairing with him and Devin on Idea-Box, he was able to articulate the problems they were facing and was able to drive out the solutions using accurate terminology. His questions were clear and concise, his approach to solving the problems were on point, and he seemed eager to continue to learn. Bravo.


#### Feedback to me

From Devin Dixon: Pairing Mod 1

* Hugh was very thorough in explaining how to solve a particular problem and encouraged us to research different ways to achieve what we were trying to do. He remains patient and focused when teaching and has a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts in JS. 10/10 would pair again.

From Chris Jordan: Pairing Mod 1

* Very informative and very patient with me. Took time to explain new concepts and obviously knew plenty about JS & jQuery

### Playing a Part

This mod, I've really immersed myself in the Turing community. I continued my involvement with the verou posse and gained valuable insight into design and data visualization. I joined iron-fe, which met every morning to tackle complex javaScript problems. I also met with a meditation group every Wednesday and practiced for thirty minutes. I tried to put myself out there as much as possible and I feel as though it really paid off. What a great mod.
