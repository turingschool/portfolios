# Hugh Morrison - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had done a fair bit of pre-work coming into Turing yet didn't feel as though I could contextualize the information that I knew. Meaning, there was no overarching framework in which I could add new tidbits of knowledge. And so, I knew close to nothing. My primary goal this mod was to create this foundation, to contextualize the things that I had learned before hand, and to solidify a solid base on which I could build more knowledge. Beyond all that, I wanted to take advantage of all that Turing has to offer and wanted to integrate myself more fully into the community. I wanted to commit. And commit I did. I have found an accepting and nurturing citizenry and I feel as though I can certainly thrive here -  professionally and as an individual as part of a larger community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on a host of projects individually. Here, I will showcase my NumberGuesser application and some interesting CSS-heavy static sites.  

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an application that generates a random number on load. This number, initially is between 1 and 100 but I incorporated customizable input fields in which one could select their own range of numbers. The goal is to guess the number that the program generates. You are given hints if it is too low or too high and you must go from there!

#### Robbie's Evaluation Notes:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

#### Evaluation Scores

##### UX/UI Expectations

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

##### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

##### Fundamental HTML

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### Fundamental CSS

* 2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

### Static Sites

#### Nickel-less Cage

* [GitHub URL](https://hmorri32.github.io/dog-party/)

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://hmorri32.github.io/hb-static-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/static-comp-challenge.html)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built some pretty cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase Linked-List, Idea-Box, and Game-Time.

### Linked List

Linked List is a jQuery powered program that grabs and displays a user's bookmarked webpages.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [DTR Memo Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HX0Uw8sAc7Y5Hn6E1gk1Oau5G6gyi77MhfWvOtoQkpg/edit?usp=sharing)


#### Robbie's Evaluation Notes:

* Some JS refactoring into smaller functions (especially with long if/else statements)
* Duplication in CSS because of none shared classes in HTML
* GitHub workflow needs more conversation, there are no comments or descriptions in PRs

#### Evaluation Scores

##### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### Workflow

* 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

##### HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Feedback from Jon:

Hugh and I were friends before link-list, so I was pretty excited that we got paired together. He is a very hard worker, and didn't mind tackling some of the more complex problems we faced.

My only area for improvement is that the both of us liked to code with our headphones in. The both of us could have benefited from coding together and learning from each other.

I hope we have another opportunity to pair on another project. You have a lot to offer to your partner, we just need to be more comfortable outside our comfort zone.


### Idea Box

Idea Box is a note taking application in which the user can sort their ideas by their quality and can search through their idea list to find the specific idea that they are seeking. We provided functionality that stores their ideas in the browser's local storage as well. We used a combination of JavaScript and jQuery to power this application.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)


#### Evaluation Scores

##### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


##### HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


##### CSS Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Collaboration

* 2: Team members shared equitably in the workload, however there are only a few pull requests, which are not labeled or documented very well.



#### Feedback from Devin:

Hugh was a great person to collaborate with. When he doesn't understand a concept or problem at hand, he works at it until he arrives at the right answer. He is dedicated to becoming a solid developer, and that is evident in the amount of time and energy he puts into his craft. One area that I would suggest working on is communication. Just opening up a bit more to the people he's working with will help a bunch when it comes time to work on a team of developers. All in all, he is an awesome person to be around and work with. He will be very successful if he maintains his drive and work ethic towards building his skill set. I was happy with how our project turned out and learned a great deal about fundamental JS, as well as what I need to work on in being a good collaborator. I would be happy to work with him again with these lessons I've learned.


### Game Time

Mike and I built a kickass 80's style break-out game for our game-time project. We built it using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas and it was a blast.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)


#### Evaluation Scores

##### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation

* 3: Five or fewer complaints

#### Feedback from Mike:

Working with Hugh on Game Time has been a great experience. Straight away I could tell he was extremely chilled out and would be easy to work with.
What I enjoyed the most about Hugh’s coding style is that he isn’t afraid to try things and break his code. He will write code to solve a problem, and if it doesn’t work, delete it and try again with new code. This was great to see.
It is also clear to me that he has a very good grasp of JavaScript already in week 6 of module 1. I can see that Hugh will grow from this into an excellent computer programmer.
I look forward to working with Hugh again on future projects.


## D: Professional Skills

This mod, we focused on building a presentable LinkedIn profile as well as updating our resumés. We also focused on how to maintain a healthy and fluid headspace.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I came across the idea of a growth mindset a few years back and it really hit home. I love that we discussed it as a community at Turing. I love the general premise. Programming is so hard for me and without this fundamental understanding that I can and will get better, I don't see how I could have completed this module. Having a growth mindset, and coupling it with the grit mindset that we talked about in a later gear up, is certainly a recipe for professional and personal success.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Professional Skills

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Resumé](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/2tuxj9fvcwj)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugh-b-morrison)
* [Github](https://github.com/hmorri32)

This lesson was huge for me. I have always been somewhat of a digital recluse and was not previously on LinkedIn. Creating one and getting to know the application has been tremendously helpful and i foresee it being an instrumental tool throughout my career. Building a personal brand and cohesive narrative is so important and this workshop was seriously illuminating.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jon Willemain: Linked-list

* I really enjoyed my time working with Jon. We have similar work and collaborative styles and so working together was a breeze. Jon is very chilled out and is open to exploring novel approaches to problem solving. His grasp on the material is excellent and he is great at distilling and teaching ideas that are difficult to comprehend. I look forward to collaborating on projects in the future.

To Mike Fenwick: GameTime

* I really enjoyed partnering with Mike on Game Time. I think this project was a huge success and I appreciate Mike’s communication/collaborative style. He displayed tremendous grit, tenacity, and resilience when tackling complex problems that arose while dealing with collision detection and while working with two-dimensional arrays. He is fluid and easy to work with and open to exploring experimental approaches to problem solving. It was a pleasure to work with Mike and I look forward to working with him again.


To Devin Beliveau: mod 2 pairing

* Thank you for pairing with me this mod. I appreciate your accessibility and willingness to take the time to help. Your feedback and knowledge surrounding local storage was instrumental for the success of “idea box”. You very clearly have a solid grasp of the material we touched and I appreciate your communication style as well as the way you are able to translate complex thoughts to digestible tidbits. Your level building and event-listeners advice for breakout was huge. I look forward to our future pairing sessions!

To Mike Limberg: mod 2 pairing

* Thank you for your openness and general good vibes. I appreciate you taking the time to help. Your advice surrounding collision detection in breakout was tremendously helpful for making our game less glitchy. I really like the way in which you are able to reduce seemingly complex concepts to easily comprehensible bits. I look forward to pairing with you next mod!



### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback to me

From Mike Limberg: Pairing Mod 2

* Hugh seems to have a great grasp on the concepts taught in Mod 1. When pairing with him he is able to clearly communicate what’s happening in his code using mostly accurate terminology. He always asks great questions and clearly has a desire to continue to grow in his programming abilities. I look forward to future pairing sessions!

From Devin Beliveau: Pairing Mod 2

* It was really fun getting to partner with you on your mod1 projects. I could definitely tell you had a good understanding of concepts and logic in JavaScript. Because my partner and I made breakout in mod1, it was interesting getting to work with you and Michael on your breakout game and see how you went about applying logic. I'm glad I could help, but it's clear you have a good understanding of what's going on. I'd be happy to partner with you again on your upcoming React projects! And as a general piece of feedback, all of us in 1610 were very happy to see you all start to be more vocal on Slack by the middle of the mod. Communication is key!

### Playing a Part

During this module, I tried to integrate myself into the Turing Community as much as possible. I attended a hackathon, joined a posse, attended many lunch roulettes, showed up for some Denver tech meetups, learned a lot in many invaluable spike sessions, made heaps of friends, and had a wonderful time.
