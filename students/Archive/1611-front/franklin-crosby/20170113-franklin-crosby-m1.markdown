#### B: Individual Work & Projects

Working on a solo project to start was great as it allowed me to work at my own pace and shoulder the full responsibility of the project.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/number_guesser.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description: Number guesser program that will randomly generate a number and let you know if your guess is higher or lower than the generated number. The user is able to set the min and max of the random number.

##### Evaluator: Robbie

##### Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

##### UX/UI Expectations

- 4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.

##### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

##### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were difficult at first but became increasingly beneficial as the mod progressed. This was due to a few factors.

1. General knowledge
2. Comfort with GitHub
3. Workflow

By the end of the mod I felt very comfortable splitting the work with my partner and greatly valued his input.

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/linked-list.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description: Program that adds web link cards to the page and allows you to remove them.

##### Evaluator: Robbie

##### Notes:

  * Too many media queries in CSS, one or two less could have been possible
  * Well refactored JS code, like the small functions and use of function reference in event listener
  * Git workflow needs work: more conversation, commenting, and equal contribution of the code base in terms of languages (one person doesn't do all the CSS or JS and visa versa)

##### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### Workflow

- 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

##### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/ideabox.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description: Program that lets you add idea cards to the page and rate them. User is able to remove and search through the cards. All cards are stored in local storage and persist on reload.

##### Evaluator: Louisa

##### Notes:

##### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


##### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/game-time.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Description: Narwhal assault is a javascript canvas game where the player takes on the murderous persona of a narwhal and attempts to spear as many seals as possible.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

#### Notes:

* Should work on breaking out collisions and keyboard actions into their own objects - so they can be tested
* Hard coding a bunch of values (especially values that rely on canvas dimensions, these should reference the canvas object's width/height)
* Had some good tests for moving the narwhal, wanted more tests for collisions
* Game flow was OK, but wasn't clear when the game was over or what my score was

##### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

##### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
Setting up a DTR meeting was new to me. I was happy to find that these meetings helped facilitate a more productive relationship and improved the mood.

    * 9 Great

  2. Coming from a state of futility and wild abandon, please provide some graceful and uplifting feedback.
    *  I love your enthusiasm and work ethic. It was great to learn all the short cuts (atom) that you know.

  3. Using little tact and and heavy brass hammer, please provide some not-so-easy-to-swallow feedback.
    * I would love to see you give yourself some more credit. We all learn at a different pace and you definitely have what it takes. Give yourself the time and space to absorb it all.

  4. If we paired together for a project, do you feel as though I carried my share of the workload. Why/How?
    * You were very open and a joy to work with. You constantly kept the mood light and productive.
