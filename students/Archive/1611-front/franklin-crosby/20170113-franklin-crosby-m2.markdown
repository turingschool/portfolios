## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

-------------------------------------------------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Solo projects were great this mod. Each project gave me a chance to figure out how to get it done on my own and build my confidence . It also taught me when to reach out for help from peers and brought us together as a mod.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

Group projects this mod stretched my abilities. On both projects there was an ever-present feeling of needing to catch up. I was forced to keep a growth mindset and push through to the end. Each project was an opportunity to build confidence and push through rough patches.

## Projects

## (2DoBox)  -----------------

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/2DoBox-Pivot2.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

Description: Refactor to do box. Utilize es6 destructuring and testing.

### Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
### Instructor: Jhun
#### Comments:

- established some really good rhythms
- I would like to see some of those things teased out just a little more
- Would like to see functions broken out into smaller pieces early and often
- let the test's guide you!

#### Specification Adherence

* 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Accessibility

* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

#### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Utilization of es6

* 2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable	 	Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times	 	Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.


#### Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.


### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## (Weathrly)  -----------------

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Obleo33/Weathrly.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

-------------------------------------------------------------

## D: Professional Skills
### Gear Up
#### Code debugging the gender gap  -----------------

* [Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

- Small biases can quickly become a societal norm and segregate the community
- Diversity quotas don’t seem necessary in an ideal world although when you work with a group of people who have biases it becomes necessary to ensure the health of your workplace
- Turing should try to instill the ideal that the best partnerships come from diversity
- The Parable of the Polygons shows in a very visual way how slight biases play out and effect society in a big way.


#### Tragedy of the Commons  -----------------

* [Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

- How do you let the more meaningful statements shine through. 
	•	What do you see that is similar/different

  - Turing makes an effort to diversify their enrollment. It would be great to see the school 		reach out to plant seeds within the community for younger developers. 

  - In some ways it seems like there is a lot of talk about the mission but its not part of the 		requirement to graduate

  • what would it take to create an inclusive environment?
  - Empathy boot camp. 
  - put majorities in the minority

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Project management strategies)  -----------------

The best course of action is to define the relationship clearly in the beginning. Clear goals and direct communication seem to work the best. I find that projects run smoothly when the team members are not afraid to let the other members know what challenges they are having and work through them as a group. Groups tend to fall apart when the goals are undefined or are not clearly communicated. They also fall apart when problems are left to fester without communication. I like to foster an open dialog from the beginning and make sure all parties are on the same page before diving in. The DTR is a great time to see how the other members approach a task and get a feeling for how they like to solve problems.   

#### (How you incorporated feedback)  -----------------

When receiving feedback, I like to try to put myself in the shoes of the person giving the feedback. This allows me to step out of myself and try to approach the issues objectively. In most cases I can see where things didn’t go to plan and assess what it was that I was trying to do and where it was misconstrued. Most issues come from under communication and disconnectedness. I find that I am able to overcome these issues by being more prepared and slowing down enough to communicate with my team.

#### (Flower Exercise)  -----------------

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/Obleo33/e405cf56cecf6ba38ad72e922e4e81f9)

#### (Plan for reaching out to a mentor)  -----------------
My first step will be to define the sectors and a few companies I am interested in. Once identified I will research to find a few individuals and contact them. I also plan to reach out to some contacts through my friend network. I will be looking for a person that is easy to talk to and open.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
#### Feedback to Kenia

Kenia is a great team member.
- Strengths:

  - Communication:
    - Kenia is a clear communicator and is able to convey her ideas in a concise way. She is also a great listener and lets you know you were heard.
  - Organization:
    - Amazing organization!!! We were on track from the start. I need her to teach me.
  - Personable:
    - Kenia is very personable and easy to like. Teaming up wither her was very easy and comfortable.
  - Open:
    - Kenia is able to incorporate others ideas into the project


- Areas of improvement:

  - Road blocks:
    - At times when I felt behind, Kenia would jump ahead to other things. While this was great for the project and deliverables, it did have the effect of making me feel a bit like a weight on the group. To be fair this was our first project and I did have some catching up to do. In the future, I would suggest taking a little breaks and making sure team members are all up to speed.

Our project ran very smoothly because of Kenia's hard work and dedication. I would definitely work with her again and often seek her out for suggestions and assistance.

#### Feedback to Hugh

Hugh is a great team member. His hard work and dedication helped drive our project to completion.

- Strengths:
  - Detailed:
    - Hugh is very detail oriented. He is not one to leave a stone unturned

  - Knowledgeable:
    - Hugh is great at debugging and often has multiple approaches to solve a problem.

  - Debugging:
    - it was great seeing Hugh’s approach. I learned many new methods from him.


- Growth:
There were times when Hugh would go off on his own and not talk through his process. While we were pair programming it was difficult to assist as it was easy to lose track of the direction. I would recommend slowing down a little and talking though the issue.


I look forward to working with Hugh again in the future.
