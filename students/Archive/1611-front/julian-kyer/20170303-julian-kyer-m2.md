# Julian Kyer - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Mod 2, I wanted to strengthen my fundamental javascript skills, understanding of object-oriented programming, and to give back to Mod 1.

## Rubric Scores

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

(Please Indicate if Pass/Fail/Pending)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Most of Mod 1 consisted of individual object-oriented programming projects. It was a departure that I didn't expect but felt paid off by the time our final project came around.

### Sorting Sweet

*   [Sorting Suite Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Is sorting sweet? It didn't seem like it at the time. It took me two days to figure out whether I'd written an insertion sort or a merge sort, but I figured it out eventually. The goal of this project was to understand some basic CS structures so that we'd be more comfortable with our fundamental JS skills, and it helped. So yeah, sorting is sweet.

I did not make my evaluation due to extreme circumstance. Jhun will review project before portfolio defense.

### Flash Cards

*   [Flash Cards Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)

I never liked flash cards. They're messy, they spill all over your backpack and get bent out of shape and I never used them. But I made a thing, and that's super cool. The point of this project was to build a set of flash cards using OOP. My biggest regret was that I didn't get to build out an interface for it. I mean, what's the point of building a digital version of something you won't use if you can't use it? Looking at you, Mint app...

No specific comments.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
##### Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
##### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
##### Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 5 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.


### Complete Me

*   [Complete Me Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

By the time this project rolled around, we had one unhappy Mod, and the Friday after it was due, the Denver bars made a lot of money. But this search trie project, designed to be the bones of an autocomplete program, set us up so well for weathrly, and we all felt that as we tackled the last project of the mod. We survived it, and I think these projects were instrumental in our development as programmers, all whining aside.

## C: Group Work & Projects

This mod was bookended by paired projects, 2DoBox Pivot and weathrly. It took a while to get back into the workflow of a team effort by the time weathrly rolled around, but I appreciated the extra-firepower that allowed us to dive back into the front-end after three weeks in the terminal.

### 2DoBox Pivot

*   [2DoBox Pivot](https://github.com/juliankyer/2dobox)
*   [2DoBox Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

2DoBox Pivot was a refactoring project, where the goal was to take an old project, IdeaBox, and refactor it using ES6, with the addition of some new features, including accessibility considerations. My partner and I hit some bumps, and I wasn't thrilled with the final outcome. As always though, I enjoyed the process.

Eval by Nathaniel Foster

##### Specification Adherence
2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above. Missing Recent ToDos.
##### Accessibility
3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.
##### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
##### HTML Style
3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
##### JavaScript Style 
3 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

Work on formatting, love the multiple files.
##### Utilization of ES6
3 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

Love to see you using class.
##### Testing 
3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.
##### Workflow 
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### weathrly

*   [weathrly Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

When I told my girlfriend I was building a weather app, she said 'what, like on your phone?' Yes, I said, but worse!

I loved this project. It was awesome learning how to use an API, and to put the previous few weeks of OOP-training to use. 

Eval by Meeka Gayhart

##### Specification Adherence
Has one axe violation but developers spent a significant amount of time researching the violation and testing in chrome vox and tab through and disagreed with the violation for this application/use case. Reasonable explanation.

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
##### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
##### HTML Style
Ammeded to a 3 after this commit

** Previous **

Developers switched over to divs quite a bit - html is laid out semantically.

Would recommend going through and switching to semantic html instead of divs.

If changes made, will bump to 3.

2.5: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.
##### CSS/SASS Style
3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
##### JavaScript Style 
Keep an eye on making sure your data cleaners don't fall over easily.

Extremely well refactored components!

Very solid 3

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
##### Testing 
Make sure you test your helpers.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
##### Workflow 
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
##### Code Sanitation 
** Score ammended to 3 ***

Student researched implementations - made a quick fix to prevent errors

** Previous **

Do a little research into how to tell the linter in the eslintrc file that you're using React. Otherwise go with the disabling the specific rule.

DM with chosen fix when fixed and score will be ammended.

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

1 - More than ten complaints

##### Feedback 
Also - excellent work on this project.

Because the code was so clean, and the project so well designed - it’s easy to dig in deep to high level topics on the eval. Very solid work and an excellent first React project. I would have been happy seeing that project from mod 3 students.

## D: Professional Skills

### Incorporating Feedback
The biggest piece of feedback I've reached to incorporate involves not being afraid to try things or break the code. Several peers last mod all suggested I try to worry less about being right the first time, and just try things. This has made coding more fun for me, and I seem to move a little quicker as I trust my abilities. The other piece of advice I received was to trust my partner more, and I'm still trying to find the balance between trusting my partner and intuiting when they need help.

### Project Management Strategies
It can be really difficult to develop effective work strategies, especially when teams turn over frequently. I think the best teams I've been on are the ones that quickly identify and discuss issues, and clearly outline expectations. I like having check-ins with teammates where we outline where we are, what we want to accomplish, and what we each want to tackle alone after we wrap up for the day, so that we are accountable to each other.

### Mentoring
I reached out to a mentor who was recommended to me, Nick Dorans. I think most of my mod has had a difficult time finding a mentor, as most of the mentor list appears to be back-end oriented. I'm glad I reached out, as his advice has been insightful and it's really nice to have someone I can throw random questions to.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Mike Limberg: Your React Mike Spike was awesome. You basically taught us that day's lesson, so we ended up getting double the instruction on React, which was incredibly helpful.

Feedback to Pamela Lovett: I think our project was stressful for both of us, and we were both disappointed to not hit a 3 on our spec completion, but your attitude lightened the mood. I got the sense during the project you had times when you were nervous about getting your hands dirty, but lately you seem way more confident in your skillset, and that's super cool to see.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Laura Turk: Pairing with Julian was excellent. I had a wide range of questions and was able to work through many of them, and he just kept asking "Great, what's next?". I left feeling a lot more comfortable with my understanding of CSS. I also appreciate that he was willing to pair on short notice early in the morning.

Feedback from Pamela Lovett: 
Julian is very easy-going, flexible, and available. Throughout our pairing on 2DoBox, he was always willing to take the time to go over different ideas and iterations of our project, which made him working with him great. Continue to work on talking through your "plan of attack" on problems. You seem to prefer to "think things out" inside your own head (as do I), but others could definitely benefit from hearing your thought processes and reasoning.

Feedback from Adam Carpenter: I really liked your approach to explaining information without giving the information up without learning on my part.

### Playing a Part

I've really enjoyed pairing with Mod 1 students, it's a great distraction from projects and I enjoy being able to give back. I'm also excited to represent Turing during Boulder Startup Week at Founder Fights, a charity boxing event, where I hope to raise $5000 for RAINN, the country's largest anti-sexual violence organization. I'll be competing against a hardware guy, so hopefully software comes out on top.

### Gear Up
#### The Gender Gap in Technology

*   [Gender Gap Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I enjoyed having this discussion with my cohort. We spoke of how this isn't just a problem endemic to the tech industry, but society in general. Most of the men expressed dismay at how frequent and underreported sexism is. We spoke of how easy it is for a few people to create an environment that is both hidden and terrible for so many, and that we wanted to be sure that everyone in our group felt safe reporting sexism and harassment, and knew who they could go to if they had a problem.
