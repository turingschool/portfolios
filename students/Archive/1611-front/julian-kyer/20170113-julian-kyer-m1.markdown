# Julian Kyer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this module were for my eustress to outweigh my distress, to feel comfortable with my tools and the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to be assimilated in my community here at Turing. It was also important to me to be able to not just learn, but to be able to help others learn as well.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Number Guesser was our principal solo project, a chance to get up to speed with some of our new tools.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

A basic game where the user tries to guess a random, computer-generated number.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

##### Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

##### UX/UI Expectations

- 4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.

##### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

##### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During Mod 1, I worked on three paired projects: Linked List, Idea Box, and Game Time.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a program to store a list of web links.

#### Evaluator: Louisa

##### Notes:
very nicely done, NO GLOBAL VARIABLES! JS very concise, small focused functions. well done. main docking of points was from small details around syntax that will become non-issues with experience. Nicely balanced JS and CSS writing between the pair.

##### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/IdeaBox2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox is an app for storing and rating ideas.

#### Evaluator: Bree

#### Notes: Scores revised for version 2.0 on Jan 3, 2017

#### Version 2.0 UPDATES

##### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### HTML Style
- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style
- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### JavaScript Style
* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Collaboration
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

***

#### Version 1.0

##### Specification Adherence

* 1 - The application is missing 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.

##### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

##### Workflow

* 2 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

##### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

#### Game Time aka Narwhal Assault

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/juliankyer/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Narwhal Assault is a Canvas-based game in which the user plays a narwhal attempting to spear seals through the ice in an arctic environment. It is not to be used for educational purposes or zoological reference. It is loosely inspired by the game Lunar Lander.

#### Evaluator: Robbie

#### Notes:

* Should work on breaking out collisions and keyboard actions into their own objects - so they can be tested
* Hard coding a bunch of values (especially values that rely on canvas dimensions, these should reference the canvas object's width/height)
* Had some good tests for moving the narwhal, wanted more tests for collisions
* Game flow was OK, but wasn't clear when the game was over or what my score was

##### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

##### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [Grit Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

In general, I found Gear Up to be a great way to pull my head up out of the nitty-gritty and re-focus on the bigger picture. I found it enlightening talking with my classmates and seeing their different reactions to the subjects we were discussing.

Maybe it's because it's the most recent, but the Gear Up on grit stuck with me. Coming from an athletic background, having grit was something I always valued, but struggled to consistently display. I've appreciated the nuanced view Turing takes about these subjects, and the effort they make to acknowledge difficult tasks. It's refreshing to be in an environment where everyone fosters the group's grit, instead of trying to hoard it for themselves.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding
[Personal Branding Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)

* [Julian Kyer Resume Link](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/10yjw5kpu8q)
* [Julian Kyer LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/juliankyer)

I really enjoyed the process of rebranding myself away from my former career. It wasn't necessarily something I was excited to do, but it ended up being something I enjoyed.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Franklin Crosby:
I think we did a good job of staying on the same page, and updating each other on what was going on when we independently added functionality to our project. I think we got hung up on a couple things that maybe us some refinement in our game, but we learned a lot from it, and we made good decisions that allowed us to complete our project on time. We did really well in terms of balancing work and trading off when we were stuck. You did a great job of checking in frequently. You keep things fun even when things aren't going well. There seemed to be a couple points where you were focused on details and I wanted to pan out and look at the bigger picture. I wouldn't even say that's a bad thing, just to be mindful that there might be points when your partner needs to take stock of what's happening, and wants to evaluate need-to-haves vs want-to-haves. I had a great time working with you; I think we had a good balance and both brought things to the table. You're one of the people in class that others consistently lean toward when they need help; part of that is your comfort with the material, but even more is your attitude.

Feedback for Krystin Villeneuve:
You aren't afraid to try a bunch of things out and see what happens. You move a team along and keep things fresh with new ideas. Be mindful of the fact that you might work quickly for some. Not necessarily a bad thing, but your pace can be really fast.


### Being a Community Member

"We had a really good balance of workload and problem solving. You are great at doing research, but be a little more fearless with the code, and don't be afraid of breaking it. It was great working with you."
-Franklin Crosby

"You always came with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor - I appreciate that in ANY working relationship. Remote pairing was challenging - we didn't do a whole lot of it, I would have liked to use github a lot more earlier on instead of waiting to meet up. BUT, we were all still a bit freaked out on version control at that point. You have great ideas - you see things from a creative perspective and you stick to your guns when you feel strongly about a given approach. This is always going to take you pretty far, just don't let it make you lose sight of what's important in a project in the long run. Trust your partner/team a bit more. Some ideas or concepts may seem abstract at first, and that can be really uncomfortable - embrace more of that discomfort (I bet you already are). In the pairings I've been assigned, I have learned to appreciate the small conflicts that help us move forward. I felt the way we handled ours was top notch - instead of dividing, we became a more united front. I was super impressed with us. Tension and discourse is always going to happen, we'll see WAY worse as we progress as developers. I think we're off to a great start."
-Krystin Villeneuve

### Playing a Part

When I started at Turing, I was worried that I would be overwhelmed by the community expectations of the program. Instead, I found myself showing up for every Friday speaker, seeking out Spike sessions that were completely unfamiliar, helping my classmates, and staying too late at the Front-End FAC.
