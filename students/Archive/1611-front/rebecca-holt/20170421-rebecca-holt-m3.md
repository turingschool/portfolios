# Rebecca Holt  - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module three, I wanted to focus on getting comfortable with React and Redux. After working on all of the projects this module, I feel most comfortable with React but feel confident in my Redux skills with use of the docs - I still get tripped up on some of the syntax but am getting more comfortable with every project. This module, I can see the larger picture of what we are learning at Turing and can see all of the knowledge I've gained come together.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our individal project for module three was our final project. I decided to make an application that pulls in resources from my previous job at a flower shop. Floral Palette is an app that allows brides/grooms to find flowers that are in season for their wedding and available in their color palette. By selected up to three colors and one season, they are presented with a list of flowers that meet their criteria. I created this application using React, Redux and Router. 

#### Personal Project - Floral Palette

* [Floral Palette Github URL](https://github.com/becs919/floral-palette)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

Floral Palette an application that is designed for brides or grooms who have started their wedding planning process find flowers that will be in season during their wedding. A user can enter in the season of their wedding and up to three colors of their color palette and be presented with a list of flowers that match their criteria. I hard coded the flower data because I wasn't able to find an API that met my needs and I could easily control what data was being presented. 

Passed

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had four group projects this module that allowed us to flex our React knowledge and learn Redux, Router, and Ember. I really enjoyed having a three person group to practice workflow with more than just two people. 

#### Headcount 2.0

* [Headcount 20.0 GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount 2.0 was our second project in React.js. It was meant to help us with object manipulation and getting a better handle on React. Headcount is an application that has school data and allows users to compare stats on the data. 

#### Evaluator: Brenna
#### Notes:

- Tests: 35 Total Tests   

#### Specification Adherence
* 3: The application completes 5 iterations.

#### Code Quality
* 3: Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### CSS/Design
* 4: Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing
* 3.5: Combo of both.

* 4: Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
* 3: Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


#### Swapi 

* [Swapi GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/swapi)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Swapi box was a project that allowed us to have a complex application in React in which multiple components and children needed to pass data around. We used the Star Wars API to get the information we needed. 

#### Evaluator: Brenna

#### Notes: 
 - Tests: 21 passing tests, no fetch tests

#### Specification Adherence

* 2: The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality

* 3: Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

* 3: Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

* 3: Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


#### Movie Tracker 

* [Movie Tracker GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker was our first project using Router and Redux. It was my first project in a group more than 2 people - I learned a lot about workflow when working in a larger group. Movie Tracker was an application that used a movie API to display the the most popular movies. It allowed users to login and favorite movies.  

#### Evaluator: Brenna 

#### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
  - Added movie trailers

#### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* I think we worked great together. We had very similar workflows and paces. We both have the tendency to have great ideas and run with it if it works and discard it if it doesn't. You don't try to force things to work - you just erase it and do it better. The individual parts of the project that you took the reins on, you did really well in. You're a stickler for syntax and clean code and I highly respect that. - to Franklin

* Staci is a great partner to work with. She is a great communicator and has great work ethic. She pays attention to the details which was really helpful when learning a new framework. She was really strong in finding the information we needed in the Ember docs and had a lot a patience of it.


### Being a Community Member

* I enjoyed working with you. You were flexible about dividing tasks, and I liked how much pair programming we did. - Julian

* It was fantastic working with you. I feel like our pacing was great and we played off each other very well. I look forward to working with you again. -Franklin

* I have worked with Becca numerous times now. She is a fantastic partner to work with. She is focused and extremely driven. She is also a great problem solver and is never afraid to throw ideas out there. Another of her strengths is that she asks concise questions and communicates and collaborates very well. She is not afraid to put in the hard work and time while remaining very adaptable.  I look forward to working with Becca again in the future! - Staci

* Positive Feedback: Paring! We worked on a project for a whole week! Rebecca is the best! Our project would not have been successful had it not been for her abilities and awesomeness! - Kyle

### Playing a Part

At Turing, I am a part of the community by attending Friday lectures, spikes, and am invloved in the Verou Posse. I also have paired with some mod 2 students this module on their projects. 

### Gear Up

This module, we had Gear Ups on Automation, Grit and Microagressions. The grit gear up was the same as the one we had on grit in module one. I enjoyed the grit gear-up the first time and it was enjoyable to see how my mindset has changed since then. We have grown so much as students since module one. The microaggressions gear-up was one of my favorites because the examples we had were realistic of the work environment as a dev and I enjoyed coming up with solutions on my own as well as hearing solutions from others in the cohort. The automation gear-up was enjoyable because it was run by mod 4 students. I felt as though there was more student involvment and outspoken opinions because we were more comfortable around the mod 4 students than we usualy are around the instructors.
