## Rebecca Holt – M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
During this second module, here at Turing, I have solidified my fundamental knowledge of Javascript principles through algorithmic based projects and quickly picked up on the fundamentals of ReactJs. I have gained a better understanding of object oriented programming as well as test driven development. I came into Turing looking to find a new passion in life, and coming out of module two, I am confident that I have succeeded in that. The next hurdle is to be confident enough in my skills to start applying for jobs and finding a career in the tech industry.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

For our final project, we built our first application in ReactJS – a weather app using WeatherUndergorund’s API. For this project we implemented test driven development using enzyme, Jquery for Ajax, and made our application accessible and responsive. 

Evaluator: Jhun 

Scores: 

Specification Adherence
* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface
* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style
* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style
* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style
* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

Testing
* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow
* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
* 4: Zero complaints


##B: Individual Work & Projects
During module two, I completed three individual projects that testing my algorithmic thinking and really stretched my fundamental knowledge of javascript. This module really pushed me to solidify my basic javascript knowledge as well as independent work ethic.

##C: Group Work & Projects

##Projects

During module two, we started off with a group project refactoring and implementing ES6 and accessibility into a past project. This first project helped me feel comfortable with refactoring my code. We ended the module by getting introduced to ReactJS and building a weather application in a paired project. During the paired projects for module two, workflow went a lot more smoothly than in module one – our familiarity and comfortability of GitHub helped ease a lot of the frustrations that came out of module one. 

##ToDo Box Pivot

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

ToDo Box Pivot was our first project during module two, which was a paired project. We took a past project and modified it to ES6, added accessibility, refactor, and add some new features to the application. 

Evaluator: Nathaniel 

Scores: 

Specification Adherence
*	3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Workflow
*	3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


##D: Professional Skills

Professional skills are important to gain and improve on as you move through Turing to prepare yourself to enter the job market and a professional setting.

##Gear Up

### Debugging the Gender Gap 

This Gear Up was especially interesting for me, being a woman entering the tech industry. This film brought to light the issues of low female representation in the tech fields and the gathered evidence to explain why that is. As a woman, it made me feel empowered knowing I will entering the workforce as a female web developer and contributing to a growing trend of females in the industry. It also me a little frightened and nervous to enter the industry as a female. Hearing the horrible stories of what women have had to endure were the extremes of my fears, but nonetheless, adds to my anxiety about it. I think that it’s an important topic to discuss especially in a school like Turing which is very open and inclusive. It was interesting to break off into discussion groups after the film which were mixed in gender and see the react of not only the other women in the class but also the men. The men were almost more interesting to discuss the topic with because they had to take a step back to think about their actions in over the last 12 weeks to see if they had unknowingly said something or done something to make the women in the class feel below them. It was eye opening to see how conscientious they became of their actions. Overall, this was my favorite gear up of my time here at Turing. It sends a very powerful message for both men and women in and out of the tech industry.  

##Professional Development Workshops

* Regarding project management strategies, it really depends on the paired partner and your DTR you filled out together. This module for pairing I have used Waffle.io for both projects which has deemed helpful for organizing thoughts and priorities. This strategy reflects the scrum method more than any other in my opinion. We are evaluating the needs on day by day basis but also looking at the project in a whole. We revisit what we need to on a need by need basis. This has proven beneficial because we don't really have customer satisfaction to incorporate as much as completing the phases of the projects. Once we start getting customer feedback in the mix in jobs, I think that the scrum method will be my preferred method for project management. 
 
* Feedback is an important part of working and being in school. Being able to accept feedback and take it constructively is a very hard thing to do for most people and especial women as I have observed. It takes courage and confidence to take someone's constructive feedback and integrate it into your life and see positive outputs from it. I always take criticism with a grain of salt, but I always consider the person's point of view before doing so. At Turing, I have found it east to take the criticisms and positives from others and incorporate it into my work style. It is important to see what others see in you as strengths as well as weaknesses. The hardest part about paired projects for me at Turing has been letting go and not letting my a-type personality get in the way of things. I am always happy to see that not come up as an issue in feedback from students. When I do receive feedback from someone which surprises me, or takes me off guard, I always try to see it from their perspective and make a conscious effort to stray away from it in my next pairing.

##Mentor 

I have a mentor/friend that went to Turing and I have known her for several years. We meet up every couple of weeks to talk about Turing and everything related. She has become someone I lean on for emotional support throughout the program but I have not approached her with any technical problems/questions yet. She has given me great career advice and we often discuss the tech industry. I have asked her if she knows anyone in the industry or who went to Turing who would be interested in being a mentor to broaden my connections in the industry because the more mentors and people you know, the better. She has not yet gotten back to me regarding this, but we have set up a time to meet over break so I will ask her again then. 

##E: Feedback

##Giving Feedback

####Self-solicited

*  Staci was a really awesome partner. She is calm and confident. We worked really well together both from home and collaborating together. You should speak up more often because you really know what you're doing!

* Jon is easy to pair with and open to other's ideas. He follows the pace of the person he pairs with and doesn't move too fast ahead. He is great at conveying his thoughts and talking through his code.

* Tim is a great partner to have. He is always excited and open to new ideas. He is confident in his work but also doesn't go too fast or too slow for his partner. He is supportive of all ideas and welcomes them even if they don't aline with his own. He shouldn't be afraid to take a break sometimes, he works so hard and he deserves it.  

* Devin has grown a lot in Module one. He has really taken the time to solidify his js fundamentals and has shown great progress. I'm impressed by how helpful he has been to his fellow classmates. His code has become much cleaner and he goes the extra mile for each project. Keep up the great work! 

####Pairing Feedback

Positive feedback about our pairing:
*	Paired-Project - You were a pleasure to work with! You made yourself available and were enthusiastic about meeting up to work anytime! You were so confidant and encouraging to work with, I am so glad our first project of this mod was with you!
*	Paired-Project - You were great all around! I appreciated how you didn't shy away from the seemingly difficult tasks and just dove right into the problems. You were always throwing out ideas for solutions and you were open to my suggestions as well. 
*	Mod 1 Pairing - You helped me understand some of the basics of programming. Our pairing session was very helpful.
* Mod 1 Pairing - I think you maintain a positive attitude in tough situations, which is something to admire. You are patient and kind, and seem to get along with everybody. Your ability to deal with problems without getting stressed is going to take you far in this field. You're a great person and I'll definitely pair with you next mod! 

Constructive criticism about our pairing
*	Paired-Project - I really don't have any constructive criticism because we worked so well together. I also think having a detailed DTR together before we started the project made all the difference. You were very upfront about what you consider to be areas to improve and it seemed to me you have already come a long way in those areas.
*	Paired-Project I don't really have much to put here. You were great. 
*	Mod 1 Pairing - I thought our pairing session went well. 

####Being a Community Member

I have become a member of the Turing community by pairing with module one students, pairing with back-end students regarding algorithmic thinking projects, going to Joan Clark Society meetings on Tuesdays, and participating in Friday Spike sessions in the Verou Posse.
