# Rebecca Holt - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis in module four were interview prep, outreach, and learning as much as possible while here at Turing. In the outreach front, I have made a lot of great connections that will lend me well in my career search. I haven't done as much on my own interview prep as I had planned to at the beginning of the module, but luckily, we have spent a lot of class time of valuable interview prep. During this last module, I have learned a lot and I feel as though everything is really coming together. Getting a chance to learn new technologies was truly a blessing this module, it allows you to see how far you've come in seven months.

Points: 140 / 150

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our group projects this module consisted of Jet-Fuel, Imposter Syndrome, and Capstone. For me, each group project involved learning a new technology. Jet-Fuel was our first back-end project with Knex, Node and Express. Imposter Syndrome was our first project in Electron. The capstone was our first project using d3. 

#### Jet Fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

Jet Fuel was our first project building a back-end application in Knex, Node and Express. Jet Fuels is a url shortener that saves your urls in folders.

Final Score: 126 / 150

Feedback: Working with Becca was an absolute dream. She was my first friend at Turing and it wasn't until mod4 that we finally got to pair on a project. I loved working with her - she is extremely hardworking and is an amazing console logger to debug any problem we came up against. The only feedback I could give her is that if she gets her mind on something it is hard for her to step back and look at it from a different angle. I know she is going to do amazing things in the development world! #fastfriends - Marissa

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/hues-picker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/impostor-syndrome.html)

Imposter Syndrome was our first and only project using Electron. We made a Hue-Picker menu bar application which allows users to upload am image, see and save a color palette as well as the ability to use an eye dropper to find a specific hue within the image. 

Passed 

Feedback: I worked with Becca in mod1 before - so it was really great to work with her again in mod4 to see how far she has progressed. She is such a hard worker, a great debugger, and a very organized individual. Becca definitely kept the team on track throughout the project, and I have no doubt, paired with her development skills, she would make an excellent project lead in her future endeavors. I would not be surprised to see her excel fast in her career. Can't wait to see where her career takes her! -Pam

#### Capstone

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/namesInTime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)

Our capstone project consisted of building a back-end for a government data set of social security baby names from 1880-2016 and displaying the data on the front-end with d3. 

Passed

Feedback: Working with Becca has been great. She is incredibly organized and can get anything done that she sets her mind to. Becca is an incredible developer and she really took on some challenging problems in our app. I know you will go very far in your career and I am excited to see where your future job/jobs lead you! - Kenia 

## D: Professional Skills

Professional development this module was really focused on the job search and future career planning. I was fortunate to meet with Meg a couple time about jobs. She was a great help with regards to outreach and appropriate follow up conversations. During this module, we did not have any Gear-Ups but were lucky enough to plan and facilitate our own. 

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JonathanSR/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In module 4, instead of having Gear Up, we get to lead a Gear Up. I decided to re-structure a previously done Gear Up (Universal Basic Income) because that was the only Gear Up I missed while being at Turing. I was present for the automation Gear Up and we ended up talking about UBI most of the time so I figured it would be a good Gear Up to lead. In our group, we had decided to play a short non-biased video that gave an introduction to UBI, separate the group based on pros/cons to discuss, then mix them up and convince the other side to change their mind. Our Gear Up ended up running extremely smoothly and I was honestly surprised at how many people participated and were discussing this topic in a very serious manor. If I could change one thing about the session, I would have tried to find a video that debated the pro and con side of UBI to give a little more context of both sides and not just a video giving a brief description of that it is and how it would theoretically work. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

To support my community at Turing, I am one the the SAB reps for our module, I co-host ironFE on Tuesdays and I participated in the Code Fair. Being an SAB rep really gives you perspective on how the whole student body is doing. Sometimes you can get caught up in the happenings of your cohort and not see the bigger picture but SAB does a great job of removing you from that sheltered view. Co-hosting ironFE on Tuesdays has been a blast and has really helped me solidify my white boarding skills for interview prep. The Code Fair this module was a great experience to be a part of. It was neat to show interested students our work on the electron project. 

### Feedback

 * Feedback for Pam: Boy have we come a far way since our first paired project in mod 1. Working with you and Hugh on the electron project had some small challenges but we all worked hard to overcome them and I am proud of that. Thank you for always having a level head and mind about the project and it's direction. When you have your mind set on something, you're determined to do it and do it well which is something I highly respect. You nailed it with the camera and the eye dropper! The only feedback that I have is that sometimes you let your emotions get the best of you and I know that it's hard to see past them sometimes but often they can hinder you. One thing that I have noticed is that your confidence has greatly improved over the course of Turing and so has your ability to speak out and it's been amazing to watch. You're a terrific developer and I can't wait to see what the world has in store for you.
 * Feedback for Marissa: Marissa was an amazing group partner. Her eye for design and bringing it to life is incredible. You have a gift! It only took 4 mods for us to work together but it was worth the wait. You helped pull me out of rabbit holes before I even knew I was stuck. The only feedback I have is that you're an amazing developer but sometimes you hold yourself back from your full potential. Don't be afraid to go outside the box and stretch those js muscles. I can't wait to see what the future holds for you! #fastfriendsforlife 
 * Feedback for Staci: even though we never had an assigned project together in mod 4, we would always pair for individual projects and help each other out when needed. Working with Staci is always positive, she always is looking to the future of the project instead of getting stuck on small problem and not being able to see past it. The only feedback i have is that sometimes you don't give yourself enough credit for the wins and you should recognize them and reward yourself! I'm truly going to miss seeing you everyday and pair programming with you!
 * Feedback for Kenia: This was my first time working with Kenia and I wish I had the chance to work with her more. She is so organized and always makes sure that our group is on top of our waffle issues. She is determined and will get any task done that she sets her mind to. The only feedback I have for her is that sometimes I feel like you hold yourself back by means of your abilities and you should speak out more and really let your abilities shine especially in group pairings. You're an amazing developer and I can't wait to see what your future holds in Seattle!
 * Feedback for Hugh: It only took four modules for us to finally work together! Working on the electron project with you and Pam was a great experience. Your vision and ability to work through problems is truly amazing. It's fascinating to see you work through a problem with such concentration and dedication. The only feedback I have for you is that when you're pair programming, sometimes you go too fast without speaking about to your choices and it can be hard to follow. You're a truly gifted developer and I can't wait to see where you end up in your career.
