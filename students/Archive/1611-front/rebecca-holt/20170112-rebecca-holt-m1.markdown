# Rebecca Holt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this first module here at Turing, I was set out to build foundational skills in coding that I will build on throughout the program so that I could enter the field of Front-End Development with full confidence in my abilities. I wanted to learn how to be successful in group projects so that I can translate those skills into the workplace. Above all else, I wanted to feel like I had a passion for what I was doing day-to-day.

## Quizlette: Passed

#### Game Time Assessment 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For our last and final project, we had to build a game that is playable in the browser as a paired project. My partner and I chose to make Breakout. In this game, we had to use design patterns to drive both the design and implementation of code, separate business-logic code from view-related code, and use test-driven design to build a client-side application. 

Evaluator: Lousia 

Functional Expectations
* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

User Interface
* 3.5 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

JavaScript Style
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow
* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints



## B: Individual Work & Projects

During module 1, we started the program off with a solo project of building a number guesser game. Having the first project be a solo project is good practice because it teaches students to use their resources and community around them. I had a lot of personal growth in terms of understanding the writing the fundamentals of coding in CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 

#### Number Guesser 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our first project during module 1, which was also a solo project. I had to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100, style the game to a provided comp and make it responsive. 

Evaluator: Bree

UX/UI Expectations
3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations
✨ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four

Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During module 1, we were assigned three different group projects. The first group project was the most challenging in terms of working as a team successfully and completing a project. Learning to work with others and filling out DTRs was an important part of respecting your partner. As the projects were assigned, I got more comfortable with group projects and the relationships became more successful as well as the projects. 

#### Linked List 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was an application that appended user input to the page. It had two input fields, which accepted a titel for a web bookmark and the bookmark URL and appended them to the right side of the page when a button was clicked. The user could delete the bookmark pairs off the page or make them read. We had to style the application based on a provided copy and make it responsive.

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes:
* Well done, need to work on locking in details like indentation consistently. Had a slight lack of balance between both Pam and Becca sharing the JS and CSS writing. Used jQuery and Flexbox, which required some end-of-project refactoring to include. Good job taking risks!

Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML Style
* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Idea Box 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/becs919/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-K2Csgx3iJIEChYd1P4O2_aJCo8qTA2IFqEDxXO6rfc/edit?usp=sharing)

Idea Box was our second group project during module 1. We had to build a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas. We had to use localStorage to store our ideas, have a live filter search input to search through our ideas and be able to rate the quality of our ideas. 

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:
* Some conversation in PRs, but not enough context about code changes in the description of the PR
JS code was clean, but needed some refactoring
HTML section for containing ideas was overstructured with div and unordered list
CSS matched the comp pretty well
Workflow was good with a lot of small commits

Specification Adherence
* 3 SOLID - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

HTML Style
* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style
* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

JavaScript Style
* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow
* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Collaboration
* 3 SOFT - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

## D: Professional Skills

Professional skills are important to gain and improve on as you move through Turing to prepare yourself to enter the job market and a professional setting. 

### Gear Up
#### Grit

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This Gear Up was especially powerful because I think it's important to have grit, especially here at Turing. Grit is something that has always been apart of my life. I define it as passion and drive -- which is a little different from the way Angela from the Ted Talk defines it. We all had to have drive and passion to quite our previous jobs and embark on a an embitious journey such as Turing. Discussing with the students in module one helped to see what drives my fellow classmates and helped me see that we all have grit, passion, and drive. I especially enjoyed this Gear Up the most because it allowed us to get closer as 1611 FE - which I think is important as we progress through the program. 


### Professional Development Workshops
####  Resume Building 

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-holt)
* [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7e0utIZxF-LNDh3Qm5KVi1CMTA/view?usp=sharing)

I really enjoyed this professional development session. I have had them before in college, but never in a professional setting such a this. I learned a lot about how to transform my LinkedIn and resume so that they are relevant to the web development world. My resume is linked into my LinkedIn profile. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Marissa is great to pair with. She is patient when working as a pair but also determined to solve problems without putting the pressure on her partner. She is darn fast at her workflow on her computer. Believe in yourself because you are so incredibly talented! Sometimes you go down a rabbit hole with a problem which can cause you to lose time with a project, but we all do it sometimes! Fast friends for life!

Krystin -You are hard-working and have drive that is contagious. Your determination is inspiring. You're great at utilizing the resources you have around you -- keep that up!
Sometimes you can be a hard ball which is great when working on projects but can also be somewhat hindering for group work.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback

Positive feedback about our pairing:
* You are really good at taking things back and explaining them through my code instead of just showing me why yours is right.

* You are tenacious and willing to try things that might be scary - like making Tetris! (RIP Tetris). When you set out to tackle a given feature, you make it work, and you celebrate the small victories that lead to the whole. This is a successful strategy in any project!

* You were an amazing partner, but I knew you would be after our DTR ;). You are a very hard working individual, and I know you are going to do well throughout this program. You were willing to meet over the weekend, you helped me code without headphones, you were willing to code on the TV's at blake - which we both were uncomfortable with. You offer great input and your personality made it easier for me to bounce ideas off of you.

* One of Rebecca's greatest strengths is her determination to do well and finish strong. She has a can-do attitude and is not afraid to reach out to others for help or clarification on things. She puts a great amount of effort into doing her very best at all times and does well with showing confidence in the decisions that she makes.

Constructive criticism about our pairing
* Trust your abilities more! You are killing it 

* Try to trust your teammates a little more on things that seem abstract at first. It's OK to read the code around you, especially our peers.

* I don't have much constructive criticism because this is an area a lot of inexperienced programmers, like ourselves, need to work on. We need to get better at breaking down the complex problems into smaller achievable steps. We knew what we wanted to achieve, but we were a little too impatient to turn to searching google when it came to our search bar function.

* At times, I believe Rebecca's determination to do her very best personal work can sometimes overshadow the team dynamic. During both our pairings in-person and remotely, I believe this played a role in our struggle to find common ground to work together on tasks as team members. 

Additional comments:
* So glad you are in this program!

* As a team, I think we'll finish this game project pretty strong. When we ran into tension and discourse, we both illustrated our perspectives, read through the code together, made some fast compromises  and kept moving forward. The tensions will happen, we handled it really well.

* I cannot wait to work on a future project with you!

### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community by being a member of a posse, going to women's coffee on Tuesday mornings, paired often with mod 2 students, participated when possible in Lunch Roulette and went on a student organized field trip to We Work.
