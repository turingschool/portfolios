# Jonathon Willemain - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to become more familiar and comfortable with my prototype methods.

Also looked to improve on being more comfortable coding in-front other individuals - still a work in progress.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
  The reason I am giving myself a 2 is because I feel pretty comfortable with my tools, but I feel like I did not convey that. Projects go really well, but something about the pressure of a final assessment gets to me. I need to work on my confidence.
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot

Comments:

Loved how maintainable the tests were
great use of for loops and how -v the tests were
keep doing this it's going to set you up for some real success in the future
testing is the key to writing good refactorable code.

Loved the file organization
helpers are super great! would love to see that
great use of closures and helper functions

I would like to see some of the files broken out.
turn it into an object and call each function so you can test that inside of a file.

Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.
Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
Utilization of es6

4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.
Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Weatherly

* https://github.com/juliankyer/weathrly
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

Specification Adherence

Has one axe violation but developers spent a significant amount of time researching the violation and testing in chrome vox and tab through and disagreed with the violation for this application/use case. Reasonable explanation.

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

User Interface

3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

Ammeded to a 3 after this commit

** Previous **

Developers switched over to divs quite a bit - html is laid out semantically.

Would recommend going through and switching to semantic html instead of divs.

If changes made, will bump to 3.

2.5: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

CSS/Sass Style

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

JavaScript Style

Keep an eye on making sure your data cleaners don't fall over easily.

Extremely well refactored components!

Very solid 3

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

Make sure you test your helpers.

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Code Sanitation

** Score amended to 3 ***

Student researched implementations - made a quick fix to prevent errors

** Previous **

Do a little research into how to tell the linter in the eslintrc file that you're using React. Otherwise go with the disabling the specific rule.

DM with chosen fix when fixed and score will be amended.

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

1 - More than ten complaints

## D: Professional Skills

I still need to work on my js enumerables, but feel like I took a huge step forward. My last project had no for loops! I still want to work on my problem solving abilites, but that is something I am going to continue to work at, even when I been in the field for 20+ years.

### Gear Up

* Gender Equality

How are your experiences at turing similar or different at turing?

I personally feel Turing does a great job at bringing diversity to coding, and is one of the reasons I picked Turing over other schools.

What will it take to make it an inclusive environment for men and women feel safe at work?

Just being respectful of everyone and treating everyone the same will help everyone be more comfortable at work.  

* Universal Basic Income

I feel, universal basic income is going to be a must. If individuals cannot spend money, what is the point of all the automated jobs? There are going to be less jobs, but hopefully we can spend our days thinking about science and art, and improve culturally.

I agree with him, the way everything is headed, with automated jobs, individuals are not going to have incomes to survive.

UBI is going to be income to help individuals survive. It is entering policy debates, because we have a shrinking workforce that isn’t going to come back. Automations helps things become more productive, which is also going to make things cheaper, but that will not help if individuals don’t have the income to spend on the necessities.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

https://gist.github.com/jonwille/c5b904a103259707fe39afbe847228f7

#### Plan on reaching out to mentor

My sister works for sendgrid, so over break I plan on reaching out to Josh Ashton. I am interested in reaching out to him, because I wan to be able to go through mock interview questions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

Jon is easy to pair with and open to other's ideas. He follows the pace of the person he pairs with and doesn't move too fast ahead. He is great at conveying his thoughts and talking through his code.

Jon has always been ready and willing to pull away from his code whenever I've asked him for assistance with my own. I always felt as though I could interrupt him while he's neck deep in his own code-quagmire without any kind of negative response. Neither has he ever been afraid to say no if he needs to, though that has been a rare occurrence. His character and attitude is one that any student can look up to (myself included) as an example of what one should expect in a fellow student, pair-partner and friend. I would recommend him for a raise but we don't get paid so I won't.

### Playing a Part

I have not done as much as I want to - I think trying to stay afloat in this difficult program takes up a lot of my time - but I try to help when any individual asks for it. I also like to keep the environment laid back and comfortable for others.
