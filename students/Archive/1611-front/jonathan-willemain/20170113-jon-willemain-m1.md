Jonathon Willemain - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During my second attempt at mod one I wanted to show how much I want to succeed at Turing, and I wanted to show how invested I am at succeeding with this class. There is still a lot of potential for growth, and that really excites me.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Number-Guesser:

https://github.com/jonwille/Number-Guess.git

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

UX/UI Expectations:

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations:

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Fundamental HTML:

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

Fundamental CSS:

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript:

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax



#### Linked-List:

Evaluator: Robbie

https://github.com/jonwille/linked-list.git

Notes:

Some JS refactoring into smaller functions (especially with long if/else statements)
Duplication in CSS because of none shared classes in HTML
GitHub workflow needs more conversation, there are no comments or descriptions in PRs

Functional Expectations:

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

Fundamental JavaScript Style:

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow:

2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

HTML Style:

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style:

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.



#### Idea-Box:

Evaluator: Robbie

https://github.com/jonwille/idea-box.git

Notes:

Some conversation in PRs, but not enough context about code changes in the description of the PR
JS code was clean, but needed some refactoring
HTML section for containing ideas was overstructured with div and unordered list
CSS matched the comp pretty well
Workflow was good with a lot of small commits.

Specification Adherence:

3 SOLID - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

HTML Style:

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style:

3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

JavaScript Style:

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow:

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Collaboration:

3 SOFT - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.



#### Game-Time:

https://github.com/jonwille/game-time.git

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Need more testing for game "collisions" before testing can be a 3 or above
Break out the game logic (check right, check left, ...) into it's own object so it can be tested
Some good efforts for refactoring, but there is some repeated code
Hard coding numbers based on canvas dimensions - not good for changing canvas dimensions
Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints



## D: Professional Skills

### The power of "yet":

This isn't something I have practiced prior to attending Turing, but I absolutely fell in love with the idea. The first time I went through mod one I would find myself getting discouraged because I wasn't picking up on the material as fast as others. I found myself wondering "how did I get into this school, they must have made a mistake." It wasn't until my last portfolio defense that I had this mindset, the confidence the instructors had in me to learn this material triggered that "yet" mindset. There are going to be things that I am not going to pick up as fast as other individuals, and I am okay with that. All I want to do is continue to work hard and continue to improve. With the resources Turing has I know I will continue to get better and get to where I want to be.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I like the idea of the Friday cross-cohart lunches, but never received any slack messages throughout this past mod.

The enjoyed the posse's, even though the one I was in wasn't around this past mod, but they tend to be geared more towards back-end and later mods.

### Being a Community Member

#### Devin Dixon

Jon is an intelligent, hard-working, light-hearted person to work with. I looked forward to working with him from day one because of his grasp on fundamental concepts and syntax, and because of the fun we would have working together. He was very supportive throughout the project and celebrated each small victory I made, even if it didn't end up going towards the final product.

One area of improvement would be to slow down a bit when working side by side and decide on a mutual plan of attack on how to accomplish the next step.

Overall Jon is an awesome dude and collaborator.

#### Rebecca Holt

Jon is a very respectful person to work with. He is willing to adapt his work style to fit the needs of his partner so the project workflow goes smoothly. He isn't afraid to delete everything and start over on a project to help him understand every line. Jon could improve on the amount of commits he makes on projects - instead of making commits with a lot of large changes, he could work on making more commits for smaller changes. Great work!! Correct!

#### Hugh Morrison

I really enjoyed my time working with Jon. We have similar work and collaborative styles and so working together was a breeze. Jon is very chilled out and is open to exploring novel approaches to problem solving. His grasp on the material is excellent and he is great at distilling and teaching ideas that are difficult to comprehend. I look forward to collaborating on projects in the future.

#### Dylan Avery

“I really miss having Jon in our cohort, but its been great to see him become one of the top programmers in the building this last six weeks. He has really developed a lot of confidence and become a model Turing student since I first met him. I think he will surprise himself and be one of the top leaders at the school before too long. Look forward to pairing with you a lot more Jon, and thank you for always coming to me for advice!!! Let’s both make lots of friends this year.”


### Playing a Part

I really like the class I am in, I try to help as much as I can because I want them to succeed an much as I want myself to succeed, but I still need to do more. I want to start to volunteering my time to the kids workshops and be more involved in the community and not just my class.
