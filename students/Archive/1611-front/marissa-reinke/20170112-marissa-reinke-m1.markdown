# Marissa - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this program my primary goal was to build up my foundation for front-end development that would give me a strong base to carry through this program as well as through my career.
My secondary goal was to get back into a solid routine and school mindset. After working in a job that was not challenging I was a little worried about switching back into a mindset for learning and critical thinking. 
My final goal was to begin to build a community of like-minded individuals - a major reason Turing was my final choice was because of this emphasis of community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects that I took on alone was really great overall to help begin to be relient on myself for seeking out and finding answers through pairing, fellow students, or good old google. I was actually very excited to be able to tackle two projects on my own for the first mod to build up my confidence in my coding abilities that I am slowly, but surely building.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Develop a game that allows the user to guess a random number that tells the user and gives a message if the number guessed was correct, too high, or too low. 

Once a number has been guessed increase difficulty by making the lowest number decrease by 10 and the max number increase by 10. 

The game should be responsive. 

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

### Fundamental HTML

- 3.5:   Strong, a few places where more semantic tags could be used. Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3.5: Had a lot of duplication on buttons, needs refactoring. Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Create a client-side interface that will use localStorage to take in the users input for idea title and idea and be able to push them back to the screen even after a page load. A user should be able to adjust the quality of the idea as well as be able to delete ideas. There also needs to be a search filter for the user to  be able to find their ideas faster. 

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Collaboration

* 4 - Team members leverage GitHub to have discussions about their solutions, track tasks/issues, and showcase a clear workflow process in their use of PRs.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My first pairing project was with Megan for Linked-List and I finished off the mod working with Kyle for Game Time. Working on a team was both challenging and rewarding.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://marissa27.github.io/linked-list/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Bp5fF66j6q2Hm7CL4VdbbFq4bvR9RYdUuQW9M2HMeM/edit?usp=sharing)

Create an application that allows the user to put in a web title then the web url and save it out. The user then should be able to mark the list item as read and delete it.

The app should display the number of list items there are as a whole, those read, and those unread. There should also be a function that will delete all list items. 

### Functional Expectations

- 3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

## D: Professional Skills
Professional skills was time set aside for growing not only as an individual, but as a community. The lessons and projects had perspective for introspection as well as having my ideas challenged. I enjoyed these for the group part the most because without hearing other perspectives it is pretty hard to grow/learn.

### Gear Up
#### GRIT

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown]()

This gear up session was really nice since as our mod was coming to a close it was just the front end mod1 people. I definitley enjoy the larger group settings, but it was nice to change it up and get to know the people in my mod even better. 

It was really interesting having stuff to read, a TedTalk, small group discussion, and a large group overview of the topic. I felt that helped to really drive the lesson home and also turn it into a greater learning experience. At first glance I did not see eye to eye with the documents description of grit being about passion persistence. I had always viewed it as something that some people have within them for doing things they do not enjoy or like. After talking in my small group though I realized that my personal grit comes from being a competitive person as well as doing things that aren't always fun for the larger picture/passion. 

Having this topic then be applied to the growth mindset idea solidified the lesson for me and why I am here at Turing. 


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissareinke)
* [Resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3svkvGDyNXweEo4ZkZ6enM4ZmJfX25OYzlWWHRCQjc5QlNV)

Finding a way to begin to define who I am from a career stance as well as a personal one and how to professionally display this on a resume or professional profile. It really helped to begin to think of these things realistically before I will be able to answer them so that when I am ready to move into the job pool I will have had plenty of time to formulate and articulate a proper response and to also have an updated and sleek portfolio and resume. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Becca Holt
Name
Marissa
Positive feedback about our pairing:
You are really good at taking things back and explaining them through my code instead of just showing me why yours is right.
Constructive criticism about our pairing
Trust your abilities more! You are killing it
Additional comments:
So glad you are in this program!

To Chelle Tuerk
Chelle was really awesome to work with during pairing. We paired during my game-time project and for me the most stressful week of the mod. Her positive attitude and excitement about coding was a breath of fresh air and was contagious.

To Noah Peden
Noah was an excellent person to pair with. He is very knowledgeable and always made me work for the answer instead of just laying it out in front of me. On top of that he also has a very positive attitude, which made it extremely easy to work alongside him and leave feeling less stressed out!

To Kyle Zucker
Working with you has been really great. You make it easy to make your skillset that is above my own as a benefit to my own education instead of me feeling like I am holding you back. I appreciate you pushing me and love our game!

To Megan Brown
What did you like about working together?
  It was very easy to work together and luckily we both enjoyed the pingpong style
What did you find challenging about working with me?
  both of our lack of knowledge in git! 
What do you see as my strengths? Weaknesses?
  You are very persistent! Could get faster with shortkeys 
What do you think I can improve on?
  Just moving around your docs 
Anything else you'd like to add?
  you were an awesome person to have in class and I am so happy for you, but bummed you are taking a mod off! 

### Being a Community Member

From Becca Holt
Marissa is great to pair with. She is patient when working as a pair but also determined to solve problems without putting the pressure on her partner. She is darn fast at her workflow on her computer. Believe in yourself because you are so incredibly talented!
Sometimes you go down a rabbit hole with a problem which can cause you to lose time with a project, but we all do it sometimes!
Fast friends for life!

From Bucket
You seem to have a solid grasp on JavaScript and think you could do very well for yourself with the ease. Keep up the grit.
I often notice you checking out and tooling around on your computer. I think that were you to keep yourself in check and concentrate on the class instruction more consistently you would do quite well for yourself.
Keep thirsty!

From Megan Brown
marissa is a great partner, she is easy to work with, very funny, and stays upbeat. she strives for the best she can do and accepts nothing less. she was a great partner and i feel lucky to have worked with her.
nope. you're great keep on keepin on.
guna miss ya lady. kick ass in mod2.

From Kyle Zucker
Marissa is the best! Fantastic coder and very creative too. It was an honor to work with her on game-time. I definitely couldn't have got thru the project without her!
None that I can think of atm


### Playing a Part

I was involved in a posse, tried to make as many womens coffee group, attended all of my lunch roulettes, went on a random field trip with some back-end people to WeWork, made friends across mods and programs.
