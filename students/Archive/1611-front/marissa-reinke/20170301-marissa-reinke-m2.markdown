# Marissa Reinke - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary objective was to continue to add onto my fundamental javascript skills. I also wanted to begin to branch out into the Turing community now that we are all in the same building! 
Going into mod1 I feel good about what I have accomplished throughout the mod with algorithmic thinking and problem solving.
The thing I want to continue on getting stronger at is definitely getting better at reading the docs.

#### SortingSuite

* [SortingSuite](https://marissa27.github.io/sorting-suits/)
* [SortingSuite Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. They give us an opportunity to focus on algorithms of various complexity all solving a relatively simple problem.

In this project, you are challenged to implement three fundamental sorting algorithms.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Sweet
# Instructor: Nathaniel
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


#### FlashCards

* [FlashCards](https://marissa27.github.io/flash-cards/)
* [FlashCards Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)

In this project, you’ll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, we’ve broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Projects done with classmates in mod2 FE

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [2DoBox-Pivot](https://marissa27.github.io/2-do-box/)
* [2DoBox-Pivot - assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

Your projects will utilize webpack & its awesome development server.

Keeping accessibility in mind we will be grading you based on how accessible your application is.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
# Instructor: Nathaniel Foster
# Comments:

# Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

# Accessibility

* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

# HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Utilization of es6

* 3 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

# Workflow

* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


I really enjoyed my time working with Marissa. She is a tenacious problem solver with heaps of grit. She is a great communicator and is open to exploring novel approaches to problem solving. She is very chilled out and wonderful to collaborate with. I look forward to working with her in the future.

#### (Weathrly)

* [Weathrly](https://marissa27.github.io/weathrly/)
* [Weathrly - assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints


Marissa is a pleasure to work with. She has a great sense of humor and keeps things light even when we hit road blocks and weren't making much progress. She is a very talented designer and it was a lot of fun working off her comps to create the UI for our app.

## :anguished: Professional Development
(Intro)

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Project Management)

This was really interesting to learn about different ways that teams can work. 

It really helped breaking out the different types and having groups learn one then teach it to the rest of the class. 

#### (Feedback)

It was good to revisit different feedback technqiues and to help recognize the different ways to approach situations dependent on the person and the project.

#### (Flower Exercise)

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3svkvGDyNXwMXZqUUFjWE80c1k/view?usp=sharing)

What is important to me when it comes to having a job. 

#### (Mentor Outreach)

I got a mentor at the beginning of the mod and I look forward to continuing to utilize that connection and work together.
Currently we meet up every other week in person and go over things I have already accomplished. 
My plan moving forward is to try and find a mentor that is React specific to continue to grow my skillset outside of the classroom. 
And one more mentor that could help me with navigating the job market abroad - specifically in New Zealand.

Takeaway - A stronger understanding of how to get a mentor and ways to keep that relationship going. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Hugh: 
Hugh was a great partner. He was always willing to go through anything he coded while we were coding separately. The thing that could have made the pairing more beneficial for both and efficient I think could have been grabbing a computer and letting one drive while we both could have gone through logically what needed to happen. 

#### To Mike:
Mike is awesome. He came up to me at a meetup and let me know that even though the pairing sheet was down that he was always available to pair. 
This mod I definitely utilized him and we ended up having Smikes where he would come into mod2 and go through stuff with whoever wanted to show up. He is extremely  helpful and an amazing teacher. 

#### To Charlie:
Charlie was an incredible partner. He is so talented and very humble about his skillset. I felt like we worked well together and did a lot of switching off who was driving and going through the logic of what we needed to do before just codiing to code. His CSS wizardy makes me very jealous! 

### Being a Community Member
#### John Binning
Marissa was great about giving me enough information to not let me be stuck, but she did not spoon feed me either
Negative Feedback: None - honest
Additional Comments: You rock!!!!!

#### Kristi Green
You get coding! Your style of help is spot on. Really appreciated your instruction and the fact that you weren't all over my computer typing in the stuff you were trying to help me with, instead, you were able to guide me and allow me to do the typing, as I took in your instruction. Thank you!
Negative: n/a

#### Dave
You were very good at guiding us to possible solutions via guided questions. It was helpful to gain thought process throughout our session.
Negative: Never!

#### Beth Knight
Marissa is one of the first friends I made at Turing. She's outgoing, helpful, and always down to go to lunch. Whenever I need someone to talk to she's there.
Additional Comments: Marissa was my gateway person to the frontend group. She's helped me make friends outside of my department, which is super helpful.

### Playing a Part

By pairiing with mod1 students in the FE and going out of my way to meet/make friends with people cross mods and programs. 
Being a part of a posse as well. 

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the commons

[Gist on Session](https://gist.github.com/marissa27/8a63dd06ab6261089034e3b2028334df)

This session was awesome. It was great to have a Gear Up that not only brought in a valuable message, but also had a fun coding/design aspect to it. That site was wonderful to navigate and made it a game to sift through the information provided. 
This gearup made me happy to be a part of such an inclusive and open community here at Turing and I feel confident the students here will bring that attitude out into the real world and will make a small dent in the problem.
