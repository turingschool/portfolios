# Charlie Dunn - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to build on my fundamental HTML and CSS skills and develop working knowledge of JavaScript. JavaScript was entirely new to me coming into the program so I knew I would need to spend majority of my time focusing on it. Additionally, I wanted to achieve a better understanding of how all three languages work together in front end development. A few weeks into the mod it was clear that I also needed to spend some time working on my personal workflow and utilize tools like spectacle to help me be more efficient and organized.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dunncl15/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Using vanilla JS, pretty cool to see the difference when you get to jQuery - could do a little more refactoring and breaking out similar functionality, also some unnecessary code with if/else statement checking the input values
Work on adding shared CSS classes for elements that are styled the same, reduced repetition in CSS
Workflow needs work, both people should drive and commit equally, and need more conversation in pull requests

Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

#### Idea Box

Evaluator: Bree

Notes: Lisa and Charlie came to an agreement whereby Charlie basically soloed the project, but Lisa was supportive and engaged throughout. Lisa is working w/ instructors on alt-study plan for remainder of course.

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Collaboration

2: BUT not failing. See notes above. - Team members shared equitably in the workload, however there are only a few pull requests, which are not labeled or documented very well.

#### Game Time

[DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h11_DDxWJmGHpo3HiizfQacit6e9ws435MVP2NUqVJQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Nice work refactoring everything out of the index.js
Need to work more on unit testing functions, there were a good amount of tests written, but need to be tested more
Canvas and context declarations from the document should not be in any file other than index.js, otherwise, you should pass it through the constructor or as function arguments
Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
[Session Overview](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The concept of growth mindset was entirely new to me. I was very intrigued by the idea after watching the ted talk video. The application of growth mindset at Turing is unquestionably beneficial because it's such a grueling process with many ups and downs. Practicing a growth mindset is very difficult, but for me it's helped in my approach to frustrating and/or difficult challenges. I try to remind myself to view these as learning opportunities rather than let frustration takeover.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Personal Branding](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesldunn/)
* [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_m6zSjWLypQLTdtY1VBdEJRWjQ/view)

It was really helpful to get some clarity on my LinkedIn profile. There are so many different job sites these days that I never really know what is actually a good use of my time. Getting feedback on my resume was very helpful as well. I've never had to create a resume for a technical job so it was really helpful to hear what recruiters and people in the industry look for and expect to see on a resume.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback for Megan:

• What did you like about working together?

You're really easy to talk to and upfront about where you're struggling or looking for help.

• What did you find challenging about working with me?

Really nothing at this point. We haven't done projects together, but working with you in class and outside of class has been a pleasure.

• What do you see as my strengths? Weaknesses?

Strengths: Very collaborative and dedicated. It's evident how much you care about learning the material. Your CSS has come a long way from the beginning of the program so keep it up!

Weaknesses: It seems like the object oriented javascript poses a bit of a challenge at times (as it does for me). The abstract thinking is very difficult and I know we struggled through mythical creatures together early on. It's great to see the strides you've made over the last several weeks.

What do you think I can improve on?

• Keep crushing the javascript problems.

---------------------

Feedback for Lisa:

Overall it was a pleasure working with you on ideabox. I know you're feeling pretty overwhelmed and a little discouraged right now, but your willingness to stay engaged and talk through problems is incredibly helpful.

Stay vocal and keep asking questions to solidify the fundamentals. It's very clear that you are committed to learning and it makes working with you enjoyable.

Keep grinding!


### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Lisa:

* Great collaborator. Generous with his time. Dilligent in his focus on problem solution. Fast with CSS and HTML.

* Accept your skill level and be verbally confident in your skill base.

Feedback from Tim:

* This was a crazy project and it was great to work with a partner that was on the same wave length. There were really frustrating times working through canvas, but you were patient and worked long hours with me, which I appreciated. Canvas and JS aside, I think you definitely have a strength in CSS. There was minimal CSS in the project, but it seemed really comfortable with positioning and styling. You also have a strong understanding of JS creative thinking on how to solve problems.

* I think the speed of your workflow could improve by learning about and using all the shortcuts in Atom.

### Playing a Part

This module I joined the Verou Posse, which proved to be valuable and interesting. It was cool to get some exposure to more advanced javascript and meet people from other mods. I also participated in a few of the lunch roulette sessions which was another nice way to meet people in the turing community.

Going forward I am going to try to get more involved with meetups and hackathons to further entrench myself in the community.
