[GitHub](https://github.com/dunncl15/headcount)

Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes 5 iterations.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.
Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### SWAPI-BOX

[GitHub](https://github.com/dunncl15/swapi-box)

Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

Design

4 - Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Movie Tracker

[GitHub](https://github.com/dunncl15/movie-tracker)

Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Added movie trailers
Redux Architecture

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Gear Up
Grit

The concept of grit is really interesting to me especially as Turing student. The idea that passion is critical to your success makes a lot of sense to me. When I reflect on my decision to come to Turing in the first place it really came down to the fact that I hadn't figured out my passion yet. I've always been able to put my head down and get through work/school, but knew there was a piece missing. At Turing you certainly need to lean on perseverance to get through, but it's easier when you're passionate about the work/projects.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Hugh Morrison - Mod3

Your artisanal and chic approach to development is refreshing. No, but seriously you're super easy to work with. It's nice how you're able to both pair and work independently with ease. Keep doing your thing.

For Marissa Reinke - Mod3

Marissa is a pleasure to work with. She has a great sense of humor and keeps things light even when we hit road blocks and weren't making much progress. She is a very talented designer and it was a lot of fun working off her comps to create the UI for our app.

### Being a Community Member

From Hugh Morrison - Mod 3

Working with Charlie was an absolute breeze. I think headcount was hugely successful, in large part to Charlie's tenacity and open communication. He showed tremendous grit and resilience in the face of uncertainty and new technologies. His styling efforts in this project were huge and our very chic UI comes as a result of his long hours and hard work. It was a pleasure working with Charlie and I look forward to doing so again soon.

From Marissa Reinke - Mod 2
Charlie was an incredible partner. He is so talented and very humble about his skillset. I felt like we worked well together and did a lot of switching off who was driving and going through the logic of what we needed to do before just coding to code. His CSS wizardy makes me very jealous!

### Playing a Part

I regularly attended the iron-fe sessions each morning and made some good connections with people in mod2 and mod4.
