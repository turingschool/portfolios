# Charlie Dunn - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module two my focus was to solidify my understanding of fundamental javascript. I spent a lot of time working through code wars, attending iron-fe sessions, and working with classmates on built-in javascript object problems, specifically array prototypes.

Comments:

loved file organization
loved the helper functions
keep sticking with SRP that will help you in the long run
keep testing.

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations
HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
JavaScript Style

3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Utilization of es6

3 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.
Testing

3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.
Workflow

3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

This was a really interesting film. I wasn't sure what to expect going into it because I wasn't aware fully aware of the gender gap problem in tech. It's talked about a lot at Turing, but this film brought to light how extreme the problem is.

I walked away from the film with an understanding that just being a bystander isn't good enough. I don't see myself as someone who negatively impacts the inclusivity of the workplace/school environment, but as this film highlighted, that's not good enough. You need to be an advocate and do your part to ensure that unrepresented groups are treated fairly and given equal opportunity.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Project Management Strategies

What has made your previous teams successful? Or difficult?
I am a firm believer that communication is key to the success of a team. If people are able to openly communicate with one another and express thoughts/opinions/feelings many issues can be avoided before they would normally arise.

When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?
Setting expectations is a good way to ensure the team is productive from the start.


#### Feedback Reflection

Once piece of feedback I've received from both instructors and peers was to be more confident in my skillset. I'm definitely going to be more aware of this and not second guess myself so much going forward. It's hard for me to be super confident as a developer right now because it's all still very new. I'm pretty hard on myself and expect a lot, which I think contributes to my lack of confidence some times. That being said, it's encouraging to hear this feedback from instructors and peers and I think with time my coding confidence will mature.

#### Flower Exercise

#### Mentor

I reached out to a former coworker who is a graduate of the back end program. He was excited about the opportunity to mentor me so the whole process was pretty easy and seamless. We try to meet remotely via screenhero every Wednesday evening. He's very interested in learning more javascript so it's been fun working on problems together.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Adam Carpenter - Mod1

Adam is sharp and really eager to learn. He picks up on things quickly and is a pleasure to pair with. He's clearly dedicated to his craft and is always looking for the next challenge. Keep working on vocalizing your thoughts especially while pairing. It really helps the other person stay engaged and assist in solving the problem.

For Marissa Reinke - Mod2

Marissa is a pleasure to work with. She has a great sense of humor and keeps things light even when we hit road blocks and weren't making much progress. She is a very talented designer and it was a lot of fun working off her comps to create the UI for our app.

### Being a Community Member

From Adam Carpenter - Mod 1
Charlie possess a huge amount of knowledge in all realms of css, html and Javascript. He was essential in helping me and my teams(as well as almost every other member of Mod1) understand and navigate the challenges we got ourselves into. He is great at explaining a challenge and pointing fellow students in the right direction without just fixing the problem for the students. His projects were used by the module 1 instructors as high-quality standards that each student should strive to achieve.


From Marissa Reinke - Mod 2
Charlie was an incredible partner. He is so talented and very humble about his skillset. I felt like we worked well together and did a lot of switching off who was driving and going through the logic of what we needed to do before just coding to code. His CSS wizardy makes me very jealous!

### Playing a Part

I attended several community meetups during this module including a CodePen one where devs from the Denver area showcased different side projects they had been working on. As a student it was great to see the type of work being produced from the professional community. I also regularly attended the iron-fe sessions each morning and met some new people from modules above and below me.
