## A: End of Module Assessment


### Progression/Completion

*

### JavaScript Style

*

### Workflow

*

### Collaboration

*


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Four projects during Module 3. First one, Headcount I chose to work along due to an odd number in our class. Second project was a paired project on Swap-box. In the third project I was part of a three person team. Finally, our last project was our self directed project which I also worked Individually on.

### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

* Tests: 40 Tests

#### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application completes 5 iterations.

#### Code Quality

* 3: Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### CSS/Design

* 3: Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing

* 3: Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing


## C: Group Work & Projects


### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/movie_tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

#### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

#### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


### Swapi-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


#### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

* 3: Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

* 3: Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Functional Expectations

* 4: Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### AI

I'm split when it come's to AI. I find it awesome but scary at the same time. My fear is that human interaction will eventually fizzle out and we'll just be deal with robots or people remotely via a computer screen.
I also worry about the loss of jobs that AI may create. I don't feel that AI will create any where near the jobs that it could possibly replace.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


#### To Devin Dixon

##### What do you think are my greatest strengths?

As before, your ability to learn and pick things up. I can tell from your attendance at Iron FE how quickly you can pick up the trickier parts of JS. The proof is how you've picked up Regex. I don't know many people that can write Regex with docs, but you can.
Keep this momentum going, embrace React and Redux and sail through Mod 3!

##### What do you think needs work?

Nothing specifically to work on. Just always stay positive, even if you hit a bump in the road. You'll overcome it.

##### Additional comments

Don't get yourself down if you don't pick something up first time around. Learning is hard, somethings will come easier than others. Look at what you've learnt so far. Keep doing what you're doing!

#### To Marissa Reinke:

Working with Marissa was great. I found her to be extremely eager to learn and is also has a really good ability to step back from the problem for a minute to re-access instead of just diving in.
I enjoyed working with Marissa as I found that she just gets on with things and produces really good work, whether it be JS, CSS or testing. Not to mention her design skills which are awesome!
I would happily work with Marissa again in Mod4.

#### To Julian Kyer:

While working with Julian during Movie Tracker I found his calm approach to programming to be very effective. If we were struggling with an issue Julian was able to research and find a solution to that problem and implement it quickly. I find this to be a very useful skill to have when programming.
Julian also has a great understanding of JS and is willing to get deeper knowledge of the things he is working on.
I look forward to working with Julian again.


### Being a Community Member

#### From Devin Dixon:

I think it's incredibly impressive and something to admire how much work you put into your craft. The hours you put in and the standards you set for yourself really convey just how much being a great programmer means to you. I find myself always looking up to you as a role model and as a motivator to do better and be better. It's been awesome getting to hang with you since we started out in mod 1 and I can't wait to see what you accomplish post-Turing. You da man!

#### From Marissa Reinke:

Working with Fenwick is awesome. He is good at going over anything he did outside of the group working together and was also letting Julian and myself drive. He is extremely humble and an amazing coder. Should probably sleep more though.

#### From Julian Kyer:

I really enjoy working with Mike. He is very inquisitive and willing to spend a lot of time figuring out the problem. I’ve also noticed that he will take breaks from his projects and cruise around, checking in on his cohort mates. He’s always willing to sit down with someone and help them tackle their problem, a generosity that doesn’t go unnoticed in 1611.


### Playing a Part
