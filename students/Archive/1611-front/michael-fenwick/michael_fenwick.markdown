## Michael Fenwick - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for module one was to become more comfortable with the fundamentals of javascript. In achieving this, I can then look to build upon that while moving forward with the Turing educational path.
In addition to the fundamentals, I also wanted to become more familiar with object-oriented javascript and how to apply that into building functional pages/apps/
I also wanted to become more comfortable with Git, Github and collaborating with my fellow students. Collaborating was something that I was unfamiliar with coming into Turing.
Lastly, I wanted to make use of the Turing community which was a big factor in why I wanted to attend this school.
I honestly feel that I have achieved all of the above during module one which and look forward to building on that.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

First javascript project whilst at Turing was an individual project to build a Number Guesser game.
We where also given static comp challenges where we had to try and match a website as best we can with the use of CSS/

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/Number_Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an application/game where it app generates a random number between 1 & 100. Following the random number generation you have to try and guess which number was generated.
Upon successful guess of the number, the number range would widen by 20. User could also set custom range for the number to be generated.

First javascript project whilst at Turing was an individual project to build a Number Guesser game.

#### Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

#### UX/UI Expectations

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

#### Functional Expectations

* 4 You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four

#### Fundamental HTML

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### Fundamental CSS

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Fundamental JavaScript

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

### Static Comp Challenges

* [StaticComp1 GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/SCC-Challenge1)
* [StaticComp1 URL](https://mickyfen17.github.io/SCC-Challenge1/)
* [StaticComp2 GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/mf_SCC_Challenge2)
* [StaticComp2 URL](https://mickyfen17.github.io/mf_SCC_Challenge2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/static-comp-challenge.html)

Static comps have been challenging, but enjoyable. I feel that I have learned a lot about how to start a project like this(media screen first) and also a lot about styling and positioning, with and without flexbox.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Three group projects which built on complexity week on week. Starting with Linked list, then ideaBox and finally, game-time.

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/Linked_List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

An app where you can save add a URL and a URL title into two inputs and on click of submit to save the bookmark to your webpage.

#### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style

* 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

#### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### HTML Style

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/BroBear/ideaBox)

* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uh6aT97XLspE0JL6GQbV1VE3iOMheZzPMDshp8B8Z7Q/edit)

Similar to linked list but also added in the feature of local storage. Mean you can refresh/leave the webpage but your saved ideas will be displayed to the webpage.

#### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Collaboration

* 4 - Team members leverage GitHub to have discussions about their solutions, track tasks/issues, and showcase a clear workflow process in their use of PRs.

##### Megan Brown:

Mike is awesome. He is incredibly intelligent and such a patient teacher. His to verbalize code is enviable. Hearing his thought processes for reading through and creating functions has been so extremely helpful. keep up the great work mike!

I am so thankful for your help Mike and for taking the time to work through the code with me. You rock!

### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

First introduction to HTML canvas and the complexities of building a functional game with it.
Our chosen game was Breakout.

#### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Code Sanitation

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### Hugh Morrison:

I really enjoyed partnering with Mike on Game Time. I think this project was a huge success and I appreciate Mike’s communication/collaborative style. He displayed tremendous grit, tenacity, and resilience when tackling complex problems that arose while dealing with collision detection and while working with two-dimensional arrays. He is fluid and easy to work with and open to exploring experimental approaches to problem solving. It was a pleasure to work with Mike and I look forward to working with him again.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

During gear up its been interesting to find out how use of a particular mindset can affect your journey through Turing and life in general.
After taking part in this session, I now consider how I'm feeling at a particular time and try to maintain a growth mindset to get around that problem. This can be testing in difficult situations but feel it helps get beyond that problem.
I feel that from my experience with module one I have been able to maintain a growth mindset.


### Professional Development Workshops

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Dylan Avery:

While pairing with Dylan during linkedList, I found him to be patient and extremely helpful. When stuck on a bug Dylan was willing to research and help us address the problem.
Dylan was also the first person who showed me that I could console.log “this” and also pass “this” into other functions. This is something that has been extremely helpful when moving forward in module 1.
I would be happy to pair with Dylan again moving forward into other modules.

##### To Devin Beliveau:

When recently paired with Devin I found her extremely easy to work with. She was very knowledgable and forthcoming with everything that she knows and willing to do her upmost to help us improve our code.
I can tell by her enthusiasm that she loves to code and gets a lot of satisfaction out of the things she has built.
I look forward to pairing with Devin again.

##### To Megan Brown:

##### What did you like about working together?
* Very easy to work with. Punctual and willing to learn and get things done.

##### What did you find challenging about working with me?
* I found nothing challenging.

##### What do you see as my strengths? Weaknesses?
* Being eager to learn and understand what is going on. Easy to communicate with.

##### What do you think I can improve on?
* From my time working with Megan, I haven't found anything that Megan would need to work on.

##### Anything else you'd like to add?
* Throughout module 1 i have enjoyed work with Megan and would be happy to do so in future modules..

##### To Hugh Morrison:

Working with Hugh on gametime has been a great experience. Straight away I could tell he was extremely chilled out and would be easy to work with.
What I enjoyed the most about Hugh’s coding style is that he isn’t afraid to try things and break his code. He will write code to solve a problem, and if it doesn’t work, delete it and try again with new code. This was great to see.
It is also clear to me that he has a very good grasp of javascript already in week 6 of module 1. I can see that Hugh will grow from this into an excellent computer programmer.
I look forward to working with Hugh again on future projects.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Dylan Avery:

Working with Michael was a very cool experience. I realized right away that he was a gifted programmer, when he showed me some of the things he had already built prior to Turing. He was real humble about it, but I could tell he had a knack for coding when I first worked with him. When pairing with Michael it felt very fulfilling because I would give him less than a sentence of advice and he would run with it instantly and quickly solve his problem. He also is very enthusiastic and you can tell he really does enjoy working with code. I look forward to seeing Michael become a leader and top programmer here at Turing!

#### From Devin Beliveau:

It was fun getting to work with you and your partner on the game time project. I could tell you had a good grasp on JavaScript logic and objects.  When I was helping you with adding some features, it was clear you knew your code well and could edit and adjust for new features pretty quickly. I was really impressed with the way your project was broken apart. It would be a pleasure to work with you again as you move through Turing!

### Playing a Part

I attended a few meetups outside of Turing and also attended the hackathon held at Blake. This was my first ever hackathon but found it to be an invaluable experience.
When arranged I would attend the lunch roulette to meet more members of the Turing community.
I plan to become more involved moving forward.
