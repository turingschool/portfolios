## B: Individual Work & Projects

Three individual projects for Module 2 to benefit us prior to being introduced to React. The first one, flashcards was to practice making classes/class instances and have them communicate with each other.
The second was sorting suite, which was were we built 3 different sorting algorithms. Each one increased in complexity but also improve the performance.
The third was Complete me, where we built a Trie data structure where we could import the dictionary and use the tree as an auto complete.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

Two group projects for Module 2. The first one, 2DoBox-Pivot was a refactored ideaBox app with the implementation of es6.
The second one was a weather application which we built using React.

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHubURL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/2DoBox-Pivot )
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

#### Notes:

An app where you can save upcoming todo's to the application.
The todos should persist after page reload.
Same application as IdeaBox in mod 1 but with the added usage of es6.

#### Functional Expectations

* Loved how maintainable the tests were
  great use of for loops and how -v the tests were
  keep doing this it's going to set you up for some real success in the future testing is the key to writing good refactorable code.

* Loved the file organization
  helpers are super great! would love to see that
  great use of closures and helper functions
  I would like to see some of the files broken out.
  turn it into an object and call each function so you can test that inside of a file.

#### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

#### Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


#### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### Utilization of es6

* 4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.


#### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Gender Gap in Tech

* [Workshop URL]()

The gender gap video that we watched has been something that has stuck with me ever since. It's obvious to see that the gender gap in the tech industry is wide.
My wife is a women who works in tech so I can hear first hand how difficult it can be in a still male driven industry.
I find Turing does a good job by providing a diverse gender ratio but feel that it won't be like that if/when we all find employment.


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Project Management Strategies

So far I've yet to be faced with any issues during projects. I've always tried to structure the project the same way where I try I get the bulk of the work done early and then use the time at the end to refactor/tidy up.
So far, this has worked and I will try to use this moving forward. On larger applications then I may need to re-think this strategy.

#### Incorporated Feedback

I've really just tried to continue from mod1 and always be available, be flexible and work hard on what ever we're working on.
So far this has worked out, so will continue in the same direction until I receive feedback not to do so.

#### Cold Outreach I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

It took me until around week 8 of the program before I decided to reach out to a mentor. My main drive was to start to build a network in California. Now, having reached out, I have found it to be extremely helpful.
If I can met as we currently are and continue down the same path then I can see myself getting a lot out of the mentorship system.
I am still trying to build a network so I'm now on the lookout for further mentors to assist with that.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### To Pam Lovett

Working with Pam on Weathrly has been a great experience. Weathrly has been a unique project as it's our introduction to React which neither of us had used before.
From the start, Pam has been hard working and willing to learn the in's and out's of React and Enzyme testing suite. It was very clear that Pam was able to take a problem and implement a solution.
What Pam can achieve while being a parent and wife blows my mind.
Not only that, Pam is extremely easy going and very easy to work with.
I look forward to working with Pam in future mods.

##### To Matt Kaufman

##### What actionable steps can I take to improve as a collaborator?

From an IronFE point of view I feel your collaboration has been really good. You have provided us with problems, gave us pointers when needed and if we weren't sure of something, you would look it up for us.

##### Anything else you'd like to add?

Thank you for your time and effort over the last 6 weeks with organizing Iron FE.
On top of completing mod 4 your still found the time to get into school early every morning and provide problems for us to solve on the white board.
I believe we've all benefited from these sessions and have become better at not only problem solving but also white boarding.


##### To Leta Keane:

Pairing with Leta has been great. On both occasions Leta has known exactly what was required which made pairing extremely easy.
Leta’s code was very well written and easy to dive into and understand what has going on. When pairing, Leta was open to trying different approaches to solve the same problem and immediately looked at ways to refactor her code.
It was clear to see that Leta knew what was going on with her code and that she only needed the smallest of nudges in the right direction before she was off writing code to solve the issues that were faced.
I can tell that Leta is going to do extremely well at Turing and I look forward to pairing with her again.


##### To John Binning:

Pairing with John has been a great experience. From the very start I could tell he was fully engaged and focused on the task in hand.
If we worked through something to solve an issue John wanted to know exactly what was going on and why. He wasn't happy just taking the code functionality at face value which is a great mind set to have.
If John continues with this approach throughout Turing and into the work field then I can see John having a successful career in development.
I would happily pair/work with John again.


##### To Devin Dixon

##### What do you think are my greatest strengths?

Your ability to learn.
I've seen a lot of growth form you during these last 6 weeks which has built confidence. I feel if you tackle problems with confidence, then you've got more chance of solving them. You've proven that!

##### Additional comments

I think the hard decision you made at the end of mod1 has paid off. You're now in an extremely strong position to enter into mod2.
I have no doubt that you will kick on from here and hit everything in front of you with the confidence you will carry from mod1.
Keep up the hard work that you're putting in!


##### To Graham Nessler

I paired with Graham almost every morning during IronFE. Throughout the daily pairings I found out very quickly that Graham was an extremely intelligent person.
I found myself in a fortunate position where I could learn from Graham and his approach to solving the problems we faced. This has helped me a lot and altered the way that I would approach problems.  
I found Graham to be very collaborative, easy to work with and a genuinely nice person.
I have no doubt that Graham has a bright future ahead of him in Software Development.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Leta Keane:

Working with you on two different projects was helpful. I appreciated that you listened and offered suggestions, instead of pushing us to solve a problem the same way you did. I thought you did a great job checking in and gauging the skill level of me and my partner, and you checked in to make sure we were following along with you. I appreciated your willingness to really look at our existing code to see how we were working, rather than just pulling up your code and showing us what you'd done. tl;dr 10/10 would pair again


#### From Pam Lovett

I think one of Fenwick's greatest strengths is his desire to always push himself further. Fenwick is not satisfied with the status quo, and it shows in both the quality of the work that he produces and the amount of effort he puts in with everything he does. What I find particularly admirable about Fenwick is his reason for pushing himself so far  - it is clear that he does this out of a true desire to gain a deeper understanding of the material at hand… not because he is trying to get a "passing" score or complete extensions on projects for the sake of completing extensions.  Throughout our pairing on Weathrly, Fenwick was a great partner. He was always available, a great communicator, and a team player.

The one piece of constructive feedback I would give to Fenwick is to GO TO SLEEP. Seriously, Fenwick. Go to sleep like one hour earlier than you do. You're making me tired.


#### From John Binning

Pairing with Mike was great.  He has been very invested in helping me reach and understand solutions to problems I was having.  Mike didn’t just give me answers, he made me think about what I was trying to do.  He has also been supportive of my growth mindset.  When I was feeling down, he related back to his mod1 experiences and encouraged me to keep pressing on and not worry.  I look forward to paring/working with Mike again in the future.


#### From Graham Nessler

I got to know Michael this module chiefly through ironFE. He proved himself to be very dedicated, attending every day or almost every day. I got to work with him in whiteboarding during many ironFE sessions, and while he struggled at times like the rest of us, he had an unwavering determination to put his best foot forward in solving the problems--particularly impressive given how early it was. I hope that Michael takes on one or more leadership positions during the remainder of his time at Turing, because others would really benefit from learning from him. He's also a really nice guy to boot.


### Playing a Part

I have attended multiple meet ups within the the Denver tech scene during the last 6 weeks. Most of the meet ups I've attended have been driven around how to get beyond the technical interview and secure a job.
I have also attended 90% of Iron FE's morning white boarding sessions and organized the FFE1 - FFE2 pairing sheet.
I also had a PR accepted for Mod1 Mythical Creatures repo where I enhanced some tests.
