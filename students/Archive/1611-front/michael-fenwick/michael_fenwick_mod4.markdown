# Mike Fenwick- M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to become stronger building databases and writing my own endpoints which I certainly feel I have. I also wanted to give as much effort as I've given the previous 3 modules right up until the last day. I also feel like i have achieved that.
Finally, I wanted to work with a cool team and build something I would be proud of for Capstone. I also feel that that has been achieved.
Overall, cool Module and glad to stick it out until the bitter end.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on a both individual and team driven projects. Most of these projects revolved around Node, Express, Knex and postgreSQL which I found to enjoy a lot more than I expected.

### BYO-BACKEND

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/build-your-own-backend)

* BYO backend was a cool project. I managed to find some csv files for various beers and breweries around the world which I filtered, seeded and created around 21 end points for.

### Instructor Feedback (Robbie)

#### Final Score: 135 / 150

### Imposter Syndrome

#### FlexBox sandbox

This was a fun little project where we were supposed to use electron to create a cool app that interacts with the users file system.
In the end we got carried away with React and didn't really use electron at all. However, I'm happy with the flexbox playground application that we built in around 2 days.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Black Mirror: What would you do for likes?

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1705-inning/group_five.md)

I thought the planning of gear ups were great. Not only could we decide on what you wanted to discuss, but it was also great to see all the students really engage in conversation with the issue we brought to the table.

I feel the issue that we chose is something that is certainly happening now and something that we shouldn't ignore. I like the episode of Black Mirror we decided to show on the subject of social media taking over the world but it's also something that makes me very uncomfortable.
I can see this type of social stereotyping happening in the not to distant future.

## E: Community Participation
My Participation wasn't the greatest this Mod and I feel I have certainly contributed more throughout earlier mods.
I did however set up this modules schedule of Iron FE after leading multiple days last module.
