# Staci McWilliams - M3/ Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus was on improving my comfort level in React and Redux. It has been a part of my journey the entire time at Turing to work on my confidence as well and that is something I put a lot of focus on this mod as well. Fine-tuning my JavaScript skills was a huge focus for me this mod and I am very happy that I was able to do so. Gaining a level of comfort with new frameworks was also on my list and this mod definitely achieved that. I look forward to continuing to grow and challenge myself and "lean in" to knowing I can solve a problem put before me.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pending re-evaluation

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Where's It On?

#### (Where's it on)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stacimcwilliams/wheres_it_on)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.
Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)

Be sure to use let and const in the correct places, there were a few that were lets that should have been consts. Need more tests. Refactor to make all functions very modular.

Pass need to tackle more testing (reducers and actions)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

- Headcount
- Swapi Box
- Movie Tracker
- remEMBER (ungraded I believe no scores given)


#### (Headcount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stacimcwilliams/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/marissa27/headcount2.0/blob/master/README.md)


2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### (Swapi Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/stacimcwilliams/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


Students: Staci & Tim

#### (Movie Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](hhttps://github.com/stacimcwilliams/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](hhttps://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.
Specification Adherence

3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through Github.

## D: Professional Development
Everything but gear-ups submitted separately

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### To Marissa Reinke (Partner on Headcount)

Marissa and I partnered on the first project of the mod. She was a great person to partner with. She is great at problem solving and is always open to trying different ways to solve a problem. She's also really good at referencing the docs or old projects to help find a solution. She was flexible and great at collaborating and working through problems. We partnered well together and I always felt like she had my back! She can get a little frustrated with herself like us all but she is good about walking away to refresh and always makes sure I do to. Can't wait to work together again!

### To Tim Brandle (Partner on swapi-box)

Tim is a great partner to work with. His problem solving skills are top-notch. He is always open to tackling a hard problem and once we figured it out he has the drive to make it better. He works extremely hard to not only get projects finished and collaborate but also to have an intimate knowledge of the material. He's also great at explaining and collaborating to make sure the team is on the same page. He puts in the really hard work and was a pleasure to work with. The only constructive feedback I would give is to not get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations for the project. You have such a passion and a drive that sometimes you try to take on too much too quickly. I had a great time working with you and look forward to working with you again in the future. It's been amazing to see your growth from Mod-1 and your willingness to share that growth with our entire mod.

### To Franklin Crosby (Partner on Movie Tracker)

Clear communication
Communication comment
Franklin an extremely strong communicator. He can work and communicate with anyone clearly and concisely. When he unsure about something he is great and talking out loud and working together to get to the solution.
Listening
Poor

Excellent
Listening comment
Franklin is a great listener. Even when he get's really excited about idea or concept if you have something to add he will always stop to listen to your idea and respond accordingly.
Work quality
Not good

5
Awesome
Work quality comment
You can see Franklin's wheels turning in his head when he is problem solving and he has a great way of working through complex problems to find a solution. He did an amazing job on our project with the CSS and he is always eager to approach a problem a different way.

Team work comment
Franklin is a pleasure to work with in a group. He is flexible and adaptable but also confident and encouraging. I would love to work with him again!
What do you think are my greatest strengths
Problem-solving, communication, adaptability, organization, determination, grit, sense of humor and kindness.
What needs some work
Hmmm this one is always hard. While I saw you be very flexible and open to our ideas most of the time I think sometimes you have a passion and a vision and it can be a challenge to compromise. This is not something I saw much of during our pairings but if I had to mention anything (and this is nitpicking) that would be it. Your ideas are awesome but always be willing to shift direction as I think it will serve you well.
Additional comments
Your the best!

Cant wait to partner again

### To Rebecca Holt (Partner on remEMBER)

I have worked with Becca numerous times now. She is a fantastic partner to work with. She is focused and extremely driven. She is also a great problem solver and is never afraid to throw ideas out there. Another of her strengths is that she asks concise questions and communicates and collaborates very well. She is not afraid to put in the hard work and time while remaining very adaptable.  I look forward to working with Becca again in the future!

### Being a Community Member

### From Marissa R (Partner on Headcount)

It was really great working with Staci. She is excellent at communication and it was always fun working through problems out loud with her and very exciting when we found a solution. You get a little flustered and worried, but I think that's something that will go away as you feel more confident in your coding abilities.

### From Franklin Crosby (Partner on Movie Tracker)
Strengths:
-	Organized
      Staci consistently kept us on track and moving forward.
-	Persistent
    	Staci would often work through frustrating moments until we were able to get things sorted out.
-	Positive
  	 Staci is a constant source of encouragement and positivity. She helps keep the group sane and chipper.

Staci is a joy to work with and consistently kept us positive and motivated. I look forward to working with her again soon.
-	Confidence
-	Staci knows a ton and if she doesn’t know right away she knows how to figure it out. At times, I could feel that she was doubting herself when she already had the answer. She should trust her intuition and allow space for mistakes.

### From Tim Brandle (Partner on Swapi Box)

As always, it was a great experience working with you. I think your biggest strength is keeping a good attitude and group moral high. We had to spend some long hours on this project and I appreciate you sticking it out with me and knocking the project out.
I think you could work on writing tests, as we all could. I also think it would help to strengthen your knowledge on js fundamentals. this should help you get faster and more confident with your coding. Overall, good experience.

### From Rebecca Holt (Partner on Ember Hackathon)

Staci is a great partner to work with. She is a great communicator and has great work ethic. She pays attention to the details which was really helpful when learning a new framework. She was really strong in finding the information we needed in the Ember docs and had a lot a patience of it.

### Playing a Part

Attended JCS as often as possible. Planed to go to meetup's with Girl Develop It but project restrictions got in the way. Partnered and paired with peers often. Participated in community Friday's. Support classmates and peers in other modules.

[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdow)

Missed due to illness and doctors appointment. I did read over the material though and put together my thoughts below and while I missed the group discussion I do think it's great that Turing has kept bringing this issue into gear-ups. I have been fortunate during my time at Turing to not have experienced this although I have peers that have and it has been a struggle. In my personal life this is something I have experience and the article [Students see many slights as racial 'microaggressions'](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/us/as-diversity-increases-slights-get-subtler-but-still-sting.html?_r=0) definitely struck a cord with me.

[Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This gear-up was a repeat of the one we had in Mod-2. It was a great video and discussion but did feel like a lot of the same content and discussions.

How did your grit come into play?
Have you been able to strengthen your grit (or your grittiness) in your time at Turing? Many times I have wanted to quit the program but have pushed through with grit.
Is it in any way problematic to think about challenges through the lens of grit (ex: emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?

- Creating elegant solutions for users that are visually appealing
- Solving complex algorithms
- Helping others in mods to grasp a concept
- Working in teams to solve a problem


-Creating something that solves a problem for someone.
-Creating something my nephews enjoyed and got them interested in learning to code.
-Collaborating with a team to build something that brings together front and back end and to work efficiently together.


-Reaching out to the network that Turing connects you with to take advance of learning opportunities.
-Would like to use my personal project to solve a need for someone or building something that could affect change in a positive way for those less fortunate.
-Pair with a back end student to build something really cool.

#### Automation

[Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

How serious of an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now to retirement?
I think it will have a profound impact on our economy. I expect that automation will continue to rise at a far quicker rate that anyone expected and with that rise unemployment will fall. These workers will find themselves unemployed and unable to train for or find new work. These people will heavily depend on government programs to stay afloat and I am unsure of what these programs will look like in the future.

Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected
I would say medium risk even though I am training for a job that right now is in demand I have no doubt that in ten years that could change completely.

What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue.
Staying aware of the issues. I think it also means being willing to give for the greater good. IE: Support UBI even if it means more of my paycheck is taken out I am happy to do that if it means a better future for everyone. Sharing the wealth as they say.

What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?
hmmmm……… my group and I discussed this and had a hard time coming up with a lot of answers here. We think they are on the right track by educating the students and continuing to place focus on the issue.
