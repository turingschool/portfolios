# Staci McWilliams - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main focus this module was to learn the methodical thinking needed to be successful at coding. From the start that mindset and also learning to break down problems to the smallest component logically was something I struggled with. Learning to use pseudo code and write out my thoughts first has been very beneficial. As we progressed in the module I found that I needed to focus on my level of comfort in JavaScript and that is something I have been working on throughout the module.

## A: End of Module Assessment

* Progression: 3
* JavaScript Problem Solving: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

I feel like the code challenges went well. I was more comfortable with the DOM manipulation challenge than the mythical creatures one. I think I get caught up on those and hesitate to put the code on the page. I appreciate that it helped me pinpoint where I need to focus my efforts and helped me to recognize the progress I have made.

4 - Zero complaints

Positive feedback for Pam and I as a team. Props for scrapping our code and starting over to make something more functional. We rewrote a lot of our code to make it more flexible and were happy with the results but would like to come back to this project and do a lot of refactoring. We will be adding onto our testing suite as we ran out of time while building the game and did not complete the testing we wanted to.


## D: Professional Skills

I created a twitter and updated my Linkedin/resume based on the feedback and I feel like have improved twofold. I am looking at getting involved with my posse volunteering with the boys and girls club to teach kids coding. Also working on getting involved with GirlDevelopIt which I hope will build a network and introduce me to other opportunities to support that community.

### Gear Up

### Growth Mindset Gear Up

No URL provided.

I found this gear up to be extremely enlightening. I also think that holding it at the beginning of Mod-1 was very beneficial for me. As our teachers say sometimes, it's a "firehose of information". I began to feel overwhelmed almost immediately in week one. I started to question myself and my decision to pursue this program. I felt the gear up provided me with tools and approaches that helped me to cope. Also hearing from the panel made it feel as though this was a safe place to share concerns with the community as there is someone who has gone through the same experience. I would credit this gear-up with me being comfortable confiding in a teacher early on in the mod and getting some much needed support.

### Grit Gear Up

* [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

The idea of Grit to me is similar to growth mindset. It's something that is easy to envision but extremely hard to put into practice. This session felt like it went hand in hand with the growth mindset gear up. It made me acknowledge that I have the tendency to go the unhealthy way and just try to barrel through things and in doing so I'm not productive and I'm not taking care of myself.  It didn't really feel like the video had a lot of useful information it in on how to develop and apply grit

### DTR Memo
#### DTR for Game Time

#### Group Member Names: Pam, Staci

#### Project Expectations:
*Pam: For me, a project is successful if both team members walk away from it having learned something. I am more concerned that we both have a solid understanding of what is going on than getting a “perfect” project turned in.
*Staci: If I feel I strengthened my technical skills during the project.

#### Schedule Expectations:
Pam: I am VERY flexible remotely and have good flexibility for in-person meet-ups. I have no preferences for scheduling, especially over the X-Mas break. I do think my brain works better in the mornings, though. HA!
Staci: No scheduling restraints


#### Communication Expectations:
  How often will we communicate? How do we keep the lines of communication open?
  Pam: I am fairly direct and to the point. I am very available on slack during nearly all hours of the day.
  Staci: In-person is always the best. I like using slack and screenhero as well. I appreciate honesty in communication as long as it is constructive and delivered kindly.

#### Abilities Expectations:
   Pam: I could use improvement in both CSS and JS. I feel like my strength in JS is edging out my CSS after the last project, but not by much. I could use improvement in all technical areas. I think the best way my team can help support improving my skills is working together.

  Staci: Strong communication/collaboration skills. Comfortable in HTML and somewhat in CSS. Avidly working on strengthening my JS skills. Very open to improving those in any way my partner suggests.

#### Workload Expectations:
  *Work together as much as possible, only split work if we have to.

####  Workflow Expectations:
  *Git/Github/Waffle
  Git/Slack
  Let the other know if we push to master or create a pull request.

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  *Pam: I am pretty direct in any feedback that I do give (which hasn’t been much these last few projects).

  *Staci: Not really in a place comfortable giving feedback in technical areas but am working on my comfort level there. I think giving and receiving constructive feedback is really beneficial and enjoy receiving it.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### (Learning to pair)


### Learning to Pair
* [Learning to pair](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

Very beneficial going into our first paired project. I felt it gave me a better idea of what to expect and how to handles the challenges I knew would arise.

### One on one with Allison

Meeting with Allison to discuss my strength finder assessment was very valuable. I agree with much of the insight she gave me. It also was motivating to discuss my professional future with her. She also had some great suggestions as far as work/life balance and it was a relief to share some of the struggles I was having with her.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Being a Community Member

### Giving Feedback

To Tim B Mod1 FE:

Thank you for all the hard work you put in on Ideabox. You were great to work with. I think your a really good teacher and towards the end you had really improved on talking out loud and working through a problem verbally. I thought you had great ideas on how to solve problems and had no problem digging in to get to the solution. I also appreciate that you were willing to stay late a few times to make sure we got our project finished. I learned so much about JS on this project and really appreciate that you let me "drive" to get the practice. I appreciate how you checked in as we were going along to make sure I was understanding, and that even when we got frustrated you stayed positive and jumped into another direction to solve the problem without hesitation.

The only area I would say is just in talking through problems out loud when collaborating but like I said I saw an improvement in that from when we started the project to the end.

To Mike in Mod 2FE

I really enjoyed pairing with you multiple times Mike. You didn't hold my hand and really made me think about things and talk out loud which was extremely helpful to me. You also took the time to whiteboard out things we were struggling with during our pairing for game time. You really know your stuff and I always feel like I come away learning a lot when working with you. One thing would be to possibly slow down a bit, I can tell you get really excited and love that but sometimes I struggle to keep up with how fast your brain is firing! I appreciate all the times you've worked with me and continue to hope to pair with you in the future!

To Anna P in Mod 2FE:

"I have paired with Anna multiple times over the past few weeks. In fact I find her to be so helpful that I keep booking her time! She is patient and knowledgeable and goes out of her way to ensure that she is helping you. I really found the way she explains thing helpful. She has helped me strengthen some of my foundational knowledge which is so important moving forward. She is also a calming person to be around and in addition to her technical expertise, her kindness is apparent. She is great at explaining things in the smallest steps while making you think for yourself to come to a solution. I only have positive things to say about Anna and consider myself VERY fortunate to have gotten to work with her."

To Pam L Mod1 FE

I have paired with Pam numerous time in classes and also on our final Mod-1 project Game Time. Pam is very quick to ask questions to clarify if she doesn't understand something and never hesitates to reach out when something is unclear. I think both of us were nervous coming into the project but Pam was very supportive of working as team and of my learning goals. She is also very proactive in acknowledging and working toward her own learning goals. I always enjoy pairing with Pam and she is very encouraging and positive. While sometimes she gets frustrated(like all of us), she is quick to implement a few plan and start tackling it. I was impressed by some of the solutions she came up with for our project. I think the next step for her would be to have confidence in her abilities.

To Krystin V Mod1 FE:

I have worked with you (and sat by you) for a large chunk of the mod. Anytime I have interacted with you I feel like we can figure out anything and it gets me excited to code. You tackle everything with a fierce enthusiasm that is contagious. You are not afraid of anything and I always really enjoy working with you. I have learned so much and you always make me feel welcome when I ask you questions. I also appreciate that you take the time to explain things as well or go over them more than once. I have not experienced this with you, but maybe pull back on the intensity a bit as I could see people maybe being intimidated to approach you. I feel fortunate that I gotten to know you and I feel comfortable seeking you out. It would be a shame if anyone didn't because you are awesome!

To Chelle Turke Mod2 FE:

I have gotten to pair with and just interact with Chelle a bit during my first Mod. I really enjoy working with her and actually have a pairing scheduled for tomorrow. She has this contagious positive energy and I really enjoy being around her. She had great ideas to get me started on my second project that helped tremendously. Even more she helped me when I needed to talk to someone about the rigors of the program. Sharing my concerns with her was really helpful and encouraging for me. Thanks Chelle!

To Bekah L Mod 2 FE:

I paired with Bekah numerous times early in the mod. I really enjoyed pairing with her and look forward to again soon. She was really great about helping me break down functions to the smallest part and get me to work through the problems. I learned a lot working with her and she made me feel very comfortable. She was also someone I was able to confide in during those first few weeks when I was feeling very overwhelmed and she made herself available to help with anything I needed. Thanks Bekah! - Staci M Mod1 FE

To Lauren P Mod 2 FE"

I have paired with and interacted with Lauren numerous times over the mod. She was always a pleasure to work with. There was one project I remember where my partner and I were stuck, Lauren came over and paired with us to help us get to a resolution. She was so helpful. I would not hesitate to pair with her again in the future. She is patient and great about breaking problems down to find the solution. Thanks Lauren! - Staci M 1611 FE
Gave feedback to Sam in Mod 2 as well but forgot to copy it before submitting.

### Feedback Received

From Tim Brandle Mod1 FE

It was great to work with you on IdeaBox. There were a lot of new concepts during this project, but you stuck with it and showed a lot of grit.  Even when you didn't quite understand a concept, you would always find another way to help out or contribute to the team.  

One thing that I do think you could work on is being comfortable with being in the learning process. There were times when it seemed like you felt bad for asking a question or for not understanding a concept. We are all going through the learning process and understand what it's like. If you feel guilty every time you need more explanation, it may get in the way of your learning. To clarify, this is not something that bothered me personally, it's just something that I think could help you improve.

It really was great working with you. I hope we get to work on another project together soon.

From Chelle T Mod1 FE:

 Staci was a joy to pair with.  She has a bright outlook and is willing to acknowledge being uncomfortable to get to a place where concepts begin to sink in.  Her approach to programming is refreshing and will benefit her along the way.  I empathize in the stress load and it’s a pleasure to see that she is aware of the bigger picture and how to get there.

From Pam Lovette Mod1 FE

I have worked with Staci on a number of occasions during class, and I am currently working with her on our final project for Mod1. Staci is extremely respectful and empathetic in her interactions with both myself and others in our cohort. She makes a very conscious effort to monitor her learning and adjust her study habits/workload due to her desire to have a deeper understanding of the material we are covering, which I believe is rare in others. Her love of learning goes past wanting to get "perfect" scores from a rubric, which I find very admirable. She has truly been a pleasure to work with throughout the course.

At times, I think that Staci can be too hard on herself.  We have discussed this a number of times, as I feel we both are similar in this way. She understands a lot more than she thinks, and she has mentioned that her self-doubt has caused her to not "speak up" during a few occasions in class or in pairings. I think this is a shame - as our cohort could definitely benefit from her thoughts and suggestions!

From Anna P in Mod2 FE:

I paired with Staci several times over the mod. She never hesitated to ask for further explanation when she didn't understand something the first time. While occasionally frustrated at not understanding something, which we all do, she didn't let it prevent her from working hard. She is very proactive in reaching out for help from as many sources as possible and in seeking help from beyond the Turing community as well. I think a good next step for her would be to trust her own abilities and have confidence in her work. - Anna P

From Bekah L Mod2 FE:

I have worked with Staci a number of times while she was beginning her time at Turing. She showed her passion and curiosity by asking me lots of questions and diving into her work. We paired a few times on different projects, and Staci showed knowledge and growth every time. She quickly picked up on concepts or anything I threw at her, so working with her was a joy. Staci shows great resilience, which I believe is a very important quality to have here at Turing. I have been happy to know Staci, and can’t wait to pair again in the future!

From Breana Mod1 FE:

You were an easy and understanding partner to work with so I had a fine time working on the project with you.

I would suggest for future partners if something is bothering you about the project I would speak up sooner. That way you and your partner can address the problem sooner and get to the root of the problem quickly and effectively.

We didn’t reach all of our goals on getting threes across the board on the rubric but we came very close. Therefore I’m mostly pleased with the results of our project. Good luck to you on future projects, and if we are paired again I look forward to sharing the challenge with you.

From Krystin V:

While never paired on a project, we have worked on in class instruction problems together. You are easy going and constantly humble, always willing to consider and try to implement the ideas of others. This may cause you to sometimes keep your own solutions to yourself - resist that urge!

#### Playing a Part

#### I attended as many Friday morning lectures as time allowed. I reached out to Mod2 students for support and also offered emotional support to them. I joined the JCS and went to as many of the Tuesday mornings as possible. I also joined Girl Develop it and plan to start attending their Meetups.
