## D: Professional Development

#### Paragraph reflection on project management strategies you used in your team projects. What went well? What didn’t go well?

In my previous projects we used Waffle in conjunction with GitHub to keep ourselves accountable and organized. Slack was also critical and kept us in contact when we were working remotely. There was one situation where our communication could have been better, I believe this is what kept us from Turing in a better project. However, that experience taught me a tremendous amount about giving and receiving feedback which I applied to future pairings.

#### Paragraph reflection on how you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process?

I was very fortunate to work with my classmates who's strengths were different than mine. This forced me to step up and show the strengths I had, as well as learn from them in the areas I was lacking. I got a lot of feedback some good and some constructive and I really tried to take it and apply it to my behavior. A number of my peers gave me the feedback to have more confidence in myself and to speak up in class more often. I learned that while I consider myself to be assertive and confidant in other areas, coming to school has caused a lot of self-doubt in my abilities. It is something that others can see as well and that I need to concentrate a lot of effort on improving. This Mod I have made an effort in speaking up in class more often and asking more questions when I am not following the lesson. Even though it can be a bit difficult to receive critical feedback, I am very open to improving and appreciate the thoughts of my peers.


#### Plan for reaching out to a mentor or alumni and/or a description of how you've already created a relationship with a mentor.

I have established a relationship with a mentor Chris Downard. He is the Engineering Manager at Granicus. I am very fortunate to have Chris as a resource and he has been very open an available with me. He also hired a friend of mine in the back end (Susi Erwin), so when I go to their office I get to interact with both of them. Although they are not my mentors I also have met with two Turing grads (Emily Dowdle and Lovisa Svallingson), both of them are amazing resources as well and have been incredibly support during my journey through Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### Feedback from me

##### To Anna P (Front-End Mod-3)

Anna was an amazing support to me in Mod-1 and continues to be throughout the program. She goes out of her way to be available to me when I need help. She has also been my ear and emotional support to help me through Turing. I don't think I could make it this far without her! She is always encouraging, honest, knowledgeable and kind.

##### To Kenia Farias - (Parter on Weatherly)

Working with Kenia was great. She is a team-player and a great collaborator. She is super encouraging and knowledgeable. She was always willing to share any knowledge she has and make sure I was following along before moving on. She has paired with me on projects and numerous times during the mod. She is always a pleasure to work with and has a great way of working through problems! She is always always willing to help or jump in and collaborate. She always teamed up with me to take headshots this mod for our classmates. She's the best! The only are I would say to work on is to have more patience with yourself. I can see you get frustrated with yourself and it causes you to lose focus. Something to be aware of and make sure to step away and take breaks.

##### To Mike Limberg - (Front-End Mod 3)

What can I say..Mike is the best!!! He is very patient and available and has helped me many times this Mod. I can see a lot of improvement in how he pairs in terms of going slower and making sure everyone or just me is following along. He has held a few "smikes" as we like to call them. He comes into our classroom and helps to clarify something we were all having trouble with that week. Mike seriously your the reason why I understand reduce!! I would love to give you some constructive feedback but I did last mod and see a huge improvement so I can't say I have any. It's always a pleasure working with you and you never make me feel as though I am bothering you. Your informational and encouraging and I appreciate all you do!

##### To Franklin Crosby - (classmate)

You are an amazing communicator Franklin. You always impress me with your ability to effectively communicate with anyone.
Collaboration and communication as well as kindness. You are always on board to help anyone who needs help, as well as seeking out assistance when you need it. Your ability to think through a problem and come to a solution is a great strength of yours as well.
We have partnered a lot but never on an assigned project. You have helped me so many times and its always been a pleasure so I don't have any constructive feedback you rock!
Your the best Franklin it's been the best having you in class and as our SAB rep.

##### To Rebecca Holt - (partner in 2DoBox-Pivot)

You were a pleasure to work with! You made yourself available and were enthusiastic about meeting up to work anytime! You were so confidant and encouraging to work with, I am so glad our first project of this mod was with you!
I really don't have any constructive criticism because we worked so well together. I also think having a detailed DTR together before we started the project made all the difference. You were very upfront about what you consider to be areas to improve and it seemed to me you have already come a long way in those areas.
Additional comments:
Your the best!

##### To Ken Lee (BEE 1701)

I have interacted with Ken multiple times since starting at Turing. He has a great attitude and a curiosity that is contagious. He is so sharp and has a tenacity that I believe will take him far. In addition to that Ken is so kind and always willing to help anywhere he can. Any team would be so lucky to have him! I look forward to working with more once we start diving into back end projects!

### Being a Community Member

### Feedback to me

##### From Anna P (Front-End Mod3)

Staci was instrumental in helping me retake headshots so I could update all my personal sites and my alumni profile. I do not enjoy having my photo taken, but she was supportive and encouraging and I was very pleased with the results. She has also been excellent emotional support when I've been having difficulty with classwork and the stress seems to get to me.

##### From Kenia F (Parter on Weatherly)

I really enjoyed working with Staci. I think we were able to really get a hang of react and TDD. Our pairing was great because one her greatest strengths is communicator and we were able to make use of our time to get all of the requirements done. Staci is super flexible and works well in a group setting.This project gave us the opportunity to really collaborate and go back and fourth with ideas. I look forward to working with Staci in future projects! I think some areas we could improve on would be refactoring. Our project went really well, but we need to be better about drying up our code.


##### From my mentor Chris Downard

Does this support emoji? 🎉👍😁 Staci is sharp and pays attention to what you're discussing. She's also willing to dive in and do the harder work.

##### From my peer Ken Lee (BEE-1701)

 It has been great getting to work with Staci. Watching her problem solve and explain how Java Script testing was an eye opener for me. Staci has shown patience and grit that I know will be a benefit to any team!

##### From Sandra Adams (incoming FEE student 1703)

Staci was so kind to meet up with me during her lunch break after I reached out to her on the Turing Slack channel. I had plenty of questions about Turing that could not be answered by faculty, but only by a student in the middle of the program. I am so happy to have gotten in touch with her - not only has she answered all the questions I had left (mostly about student life, work-life balance, difficulty of the program), she even gave me and my husband a tour through the new facility. She’s really been exemplary to what I was hoping the student body would be like: smart, curious, and determined to make the best out of the program. With all my questions answered, the walk-through of the classrooms, and Staci’s kindness, I am even more looking forward to the first day of classes!

##### From Amanda C FEE 1701

Great - she's encouraging, informative, and kind. I always felt comfortable asking her questions. She helped me work through problems by leading me, not telling me how to solve a problem, and offered me advice/reminders on growth mindset.

##### Rebeeca Holt (1611 FE)Parter on 2DoBox-Pivot

Staci was a really awesome partner. She is calm and confident. We worked really well together both from home and collaborating together. You should speak up more often because you really know what you're doing!

##### Mike Limberg (Front-end Mod 3)

Staci is GREAT to pair with. It’s been awesome to see the growth from Mod 1. She makes pairing super easy by asking concise questions and showing significant interest in figuring out the answer. Happy to pair any time and keep grindin’!  



### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
- I partnered with my peer Kenia and we offered to take headshots for our other classmates. I took the photos and she did the editing.
- Had a meeting and gave a tour to a front-end student starting next mod.
- Attended JCS and Friday morning lectures as often as possible.
- Paired with Mod-1 Front-end students throughout the semester.


### Gear Up


[Universal Basic Income](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)



I think the harsh reality is that technology is moving faster than new jobs are being created. If we look at the landscape of jobs into the future there are very few that feel “protected”. Even software developer jobs like ours will be at risk once they become automated and the computers can write more efficient code than us.

I agree with him completely. We are facing an obstacle that we never have an if we don’t respond to it with a solution like UBI a huge number of our population will be in jeopardy.

UBI is a system that could be compared to social security for all. It would be paid by taxes and pay out to all citizens (regardless of income). It is entering policy debates because automation is displacing workers from their jobs and while some politicians  say they can “bring jobs back to America”  we have to acknowledge that a lot of these jobs no longer exist and we have to talk about alternative solutions. I think everyone should be aware of trends in automation and have a hand on the pulse of the industry as it directly ties into the jobs available in society.

I think it’s absolutely worthwhile to be educated on automation as it is changing the future for all of us. Those affected now in the near future and much later. I think I can have an impact by supporting these policy changes and by being active in my local government. The more you know the more others around you know and I believe that is how change begins.
(reflect on your Gear Up sessions following the below example)

 [Tragedy_of_the_commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This lesson really illuminated how difficult getting diversity within communities. I liked the interactive part of the spike as well. I think anytime we can facilitate a conversation about diversity is good but I can't say I came away with any useful ideas on improving this particular challenge.

[Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I really enjoyed screening this film. I feel like bringing these types of conversations to the classroom is helpful. I don't think it's something that is easy or natural to discuss, but brings value to our class by opening it up for discussion. I was very happy to hear the conversations that went on after the film and was encouraged by the conversations that it facilitated.

How are you experiences at Turing similar or different from the video.

My experience at Turing has made me feel safe from the first day. I have been fortunate enough to not have experienced this at school. However, this is the luck of the draw many of my peers have experienced this either in paired partners and I have just been very lucky in that regard. How do we ensure that everyone has that experience and has a safe place to go to if an issue does arise???
(Maybe an anonymous staff member they can reach out to if it happens?) The fear of lash back is what I believe keeps many from sharing experiences or worse brushing them off as “normal”.  

What does it take to create an inclusive environment where everyone would feel safe to come to work.

Have a female teacher in every mod (not necessary an anchor but somehow in the room)
Keep it at the forefront of everyone's mind and open up discussions about it often.

How does anyone know about it if no one talks about it. How do we open this up to a broader audience without it seeming like an attack.

Really stood out to me the woman who said it was a difficult battle with her conscious to encourage women to go into this industry when they may be abused and not have a safe place to be.
