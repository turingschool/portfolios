###### Score

*Specification Adherence*

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

*Redux Architecture*

4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

*Routing*

4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

*JavaScript Style*

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

*Testing*

2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

*Workflow*

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

### Gear Up

#### Grit

Grit was a great compliment to the Growth Mindset session There were a lot of different ideas thrown around about what grit is and how it impacts us, specifically our experience at Turing.


### Giving Feedback

**Staci Williams**
As always, it was a great experience working with you. I think your biggest strength is keeping a good attitude and group moral high. We had to spend some long hours on this project and I appreciate you sticking it out with me and knocking the project out. I think you could work on writing tests, as we all could. I also think it would help to strengthen your knowledge on js fundamentals. this should help you get faster and more confident with your coding. Overall, good experience.

### Receiving Feedback

**Staci Williams**
Tim is a great partner to work with. His problem solving skills are top-notch. He is always open to tackling a hard problem and once we figured it out he has the drive to make it better. He works extremely hard to not only get projects finished and collaborate but also to have an intimate knowledge of the material. He's also great at explaining and collaborating to make sure the team is on the same page. He puts in the really hard work and was a pleasure to work with. The only constructive feedback I would give is to not get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations for the project. You have such a passion and a drive that sometimes you try to take on too much too quickly. I had a great time working with you and look forward to working with you again in the future. It's been amazing to see your growth from Mod-1 and your willingness to share that growth with our entire mod.

**Hugh Morrison**
Tim is a great team member. He has a voracious intellectual appetite and approaches difficult problems in a truly gritty manner. He's keen to take novel approaches to problem solving and communicates well. 10/10 look forward to working together again.

Positive feedback *
I had the opportunity to work with Tim for a paired UX/UI project as well as a larger project where a group of us implemented React, Redux, and Router 4 in an application. Without a doubt, Tim is one of the hardest working students in our cohort.  He has a deep passion for solving problems and an insatiable curiosity, which is both admirable and contagious.  Tim is one of the first persons whom I seek out when I need assistance with my work, which is largely due to the characteristics I have named and his excellent communication skills.

Areas for improvement *
Tim should continue to reach out for help from those who can give him nudges in the right direction when he may be stuck with a problem for longer than usual. He has sometimes hesitated to do so in the past (which is feedback I gave to him while doing our group project). Since giving him this feedback initially, I have seen change his strategies and reach out to those around him more.

Positive feedback *
You have laser focus! Working with you on Movie Tracker was a great experience. We were all a little nervous going into Redux, but you had a great attitude towards the project and we were able to get it done. You have a great understanding of JS and React and were able to solve problems quickly. I'm really looking forward to working with you in the future.
Areas for improvement *
Take more breaks!
