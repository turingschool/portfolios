# Tim Brandle - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into this module expecting to gain a better understanding of CSS and HTML, as well as dive into Javascript basics for the first time.

I knew I was going to put in long hours throughout the program, but I didn't expect how much I would actually learn in such a little amount of time. I am surprised at how much there actually is to know and I'm excited to tackle Mod 2.

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

#### LinkedList

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Notes:

jQuery and JS looked pretty clean, could use some refactoring to pull out some logic with if/else statements
Couldn't assess much on workflow because you weren't paired with anyone, but would have liked to see smaller commits so that when you do get in a partner situation, then the pull requests they have to review aren't huge
Use more shared CSS classes to reduce repetition in styling
Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tbrandle/link-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Notes:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
CSS Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
JavaScript Style

3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Collaboration

3.5 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

#### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tbrandle/link-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Notes:

Nice work refactoring everything out of the index.js
Need to work more on unit testing functions, there were a good amount of tests written, but need to be tested more
Canvas and context declarations from the document should not be in any file other than index.js, otherwise, you should pass it through the constructor or as function arguments
Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

3 - Five or fewer complaints


## D: Professional Skills

Here is my DTR for IdeaBox with Staci.  This was tremendously helpful in setting expectations for working styles and exactly what we aimed to accomplish throughout the project.

### Gear Up
#### Introvert/Extrovert

This session was somewhat familiar to me, but I think is important to understand when working with other people. There were a few introverts, and extroverts, that I did not expect. It was a good reminder that first judgements are not always correct.

#### Growth Mindset

I loved this Gear Up. I think it is very important to have and essential to getting the most of my experience here at Turing.

#### Grit

Grit was a great compliment to the Growth Mindset session There were a lot of different ideas thrown around about what grit is and how it impacts us, specifically our experience at Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Staci Williams**

It was great to work with you on IdeaBox. There were a lot of new concepts during this project, but you stuck with it and showed a lot of grit.  Even when you didn't quite understand a concept, you would always find another way to help out or contribute to the team.

One thing that I do think you could work on is being comfortable with being in the learning process. There were times when it seemed like you felt bad for asking a question or for not understanding a concept. We are all going through the learning process and understand what it's like. If you feel guilty every time you need more explanation, it may get in the way of your learning. To clarify, this is not something that bothered me personally, it's just something that I think could help you improve.

It really was great working with you. I hope we get to work on another project together soon.

**Charlie Dunn**

This was a crazy project and it was great to work with a partner that was on the same wave length. There were really frustrating times working through canvas, but you were patient and worked long hours with me, which I appreciated. Canvas and JS aside,  I think you definitely have a strength in CSS. There was minimal CSS in the project, but it seemed really comfortable with positioning and styling. You also have a strong understanding of JS creative thinking on how to solve problems.

I think the speed of your workflow could improve by learning about and using all the shortcuts in Atom.

### Being a Community Member

**Staci Williams**

Thank you for all the hard work you put in on Ideabox. You were great to work with. I think your a really good teacher and towards the end you had really improved on talking out loud and working through a problem verbally. I thought you had great ideas on how to solve problems and had no problem digging in to get to the solution. I also appreciate that you were willing to stay late a few times to make sure we got our project finished. I learned so much about JS on this project and really appreciate that you let me "drive" to get the practice. I appreciate how you checked in as we were going along to make sure I was understanding, and that even when we got frustrated you stayed positive and jumped into another direction to solve the problem without hesitation.

The only area I would say is just in talking through problems out loud when collaborating but like I said I saw an improvement in that from when we started the project to the end.

**Charlie Dunn**
Awesome work on game time. It was a really grueling project, but you were positive throughout and open to ideas/suggestions. You seemed to have a strong grasp of canvas and object oriented programming which was really helpful for me to continue to learn.
Keep working on being vocal while you're coding and talking through what you're writing.


<!-- ### Playing a Part -->

I have made an effort to attend all of the Turing events and guest speakers. Helping my classmates work through problems and explain concepts is another way I was able to contribute to the Turing community.
