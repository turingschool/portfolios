Passing Scores

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I felt like a majority of my growth came from the individual project work that I did this mod. Having to do my own work and struggle through problems on my own was difficult - but served me well.

Individual Projects:
* Flashcards
* Sorting Suite
* Complete-Me

###Flashcards

## D: Professional Skills/Development

I looked forward to setting up a DTR in each of my pairings in order to better understand my partner's pairing goals and strengths and witnesses.

[DTR with Fenwick for Weathrly ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dj0X4hEZPJcKhtwIOC_Zbrz6yJKP34hweeiMv3L9huA/edit#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg)

####Reflection on Project Management strategies

I enjoyed the session that we had on project management strategies. It was nice to have the opportunity to work in groups to dissect the information we were covering. There's a lot to be learned from hearing the opinions of others - so it's great when we have opportunities to due just that.

####Reflection on incorporating feedback from team members

One piece of feedback that I have received pretty consistently from others is that I am a bit too hard on myself and that I need to work on my confidence. I have tried to incorporate this by answering more questions in class, speaking up more during projects, and working on code challenges outside of the classroom. I learned that I could channel the critic in myself into something positive.... and that being critical with myself is great for pushing myself far but can (and does) kill my confidence.

####Plan for reaching out to a mentor
I am meeting with my mentor over the session break for coffee. In addition to that, I am planning on reaching out to another mentor via slack.

### Gear Up Reflections

[Debugging_the_gender_gap](n/a)

I can honestly say that our gear up on debugging the gender gap was probably our best gear up yet. It was a great way to talk about a really difficult subject matter.

[Tragedy_of_the_commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I loved the interaction piece of this gear-up as well as having the opportunity to speak to others in my cohort about the power of group norms. It was especially interesting to hear how each person in my discussion viewed diversity quotas.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####to Michael Fenwick(Weathrly)

I think one of Fenwick's greatest strengths is his desire to always push himself further. Fenwick is not satisfied with the status quo, and it shows in both the quality of the work that he produces and the amount of effort he puts in with everything he does. What I find particularly admirable about Fenwick is his reason for pushing himself so far  - it is clear that he does this out of a true desire to gain a deeper understanding of the material at hand… not because he is trying to get a "passing" score or complete extensions on projects for the sake of completing extensions.  Throughout our pairing on Weathrly, Fenwick was a great partner. He was always available, a great communicator, and a team player.

The one piece of constructive feedback I would give to Fenwick is to GO TO SLEEP. Seriously, Fenwick. Go to sleep like one hour earlier than you do. You're making me tired.

####to Julian Kyer(2DoxBox-Pivot)



####to Mike Limberg(Mod3)

I have come to Mike for help on a number of occasions since becoming a student at Turing. Most recently, I attended a "Mike Spike" where Mike went over array prototypes with some Mod2 students. Mike's ability to explain complex topics in easy-to-understand terms is, without exaggeration, phenomenal. After a 40 minute "Mike Spike," I walked away with a much deeper understanding of array prototypes. I think this is due to two things: Mike's deep understanding of the material that we are covering AND his ability to re-phrase ideas in other ways when people don't understand things the first (or second) time around.

####to Anders Wood(Mod1)

Pairing with Anders on LinkedList was a great experience. He is very open to feedback and is very quick to take the initiative when it comes to his own learning. Per my suggestion, he was ready and willing to implement jQuery into his project - despite only being introduced to it the day before. There wasn't a moment when Anders was simply waiting for me to just hand him the answer - he was very engaged throughout the whole pairing. I have no doubt that his initiative and positive attitude will serve him well in future mods.

### Being a Community Member

####from Julian Kyer (2DoxBox-Pivot)

I think our project was stressful for both of us, and we were both disappointed to not hit a 3 on our spec completion, but your attitude lightened the mood. I got the sense during the project you had times when you were nervous about getting your hands dirty, but lately you seem way more confident in your skillset, and that's super cool to see.

####from Anders Wood (Mod1)

Pairing with Pam was great. Pam provided helpful guidance without giving us the answer. She did this by looking at our code and seeing the direction we were moving so that her guidance was specific to our work. Pam's support was helpful because she had the expertise in general and specifically she was familiar with our project. She is also nice and friendly, so that was awesome.

####from Michael Fenwick (Weathrly)

Working with Pam on Weathrly has been a great experience. Weathrly has been a unique project as it's our introduction to React which neither of us had used before.
From the start, Pam has been hard working and willing to learn the in's and out's of React and Enzyme testing suite. It was very clear that Pam was able to take a problem and implement a solution.
What Pam can achieve while being a parent and wife blows my mind.
Not only that, Pam is extremely easy going and very easy to work with.
I look forward to working with Pam in future mods.

### Playing a Part

I joined and attended IronFe in the mornings and also led my Mod as an SAB representative.
