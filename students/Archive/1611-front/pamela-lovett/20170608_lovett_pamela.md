# Pamela Lovett - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into Mod4, I wanted to make sure that I had a solid understand of the BE environment in order to have a better grasp of the work that we do on the FE.  I wanted to continue to build on the foundation and really work on my algorithmic thinking skills. I also wanted to start a project that could eventually be deployed to the App Store.

* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1611/mod-4/byob/pamela_lovett.md)

The main focus of this project was to reinforce our understanding of CRUD methods, querying a database, and responding with JSON data. I chose to work with and API from an affiliate marketing company that would enable me to build a database with tables of merchants and products.

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/hues-picker)

For this project, my group created a menubar application made in Electron.

It allowed the user to upload their favorites images, see the 8 most prominent colors and save the palette to a txt file, and use a color picker to grab specific colors from the image. Supports jpgs, pngs, and svgs.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### "Danger of a Single Story"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1705-inning/group_eight.md)

Planning a Gear-Up for the lower mods was a great way for us to participate in the larger community. It was nice to engage with other Turing students that we don't really see on a normal basis. For our Gear-Up session, we discussed how assumptions and unconscious-bias can create "single stories" that we have about those around us at Turing and the larger tech community. 

For this Gear Up, we did a lot of group discussion and also watched part of a TED talk. Due to time constraints, we were unable to complete the line walk that we had originally planned. Although I think this would have made things a bit more interesting, the students were still having really engaging conversations with each other - which was awesome!  

## E: Community Participation
* Spoke on a Try Turing Panel
* Led one Iron FE
* Paired with Mod3 on personal projects
* Spoke to Mod1FE

### Playing a Part
* Going to MeetUps
* Applying to jobs
